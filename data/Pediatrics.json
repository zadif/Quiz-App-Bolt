His blood pressure is 112/70 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, respirations are 20/min, and temperature\nis 38.3C (101F). Examination reveals an erythematous rash with a sandpaper-like texture, and which\nblanches with pressure.

      "C. Scarlet fever",
      "D. Herpangina",
      "E. Mononucleosis",
      "F. Toxic epidermal necrosis",
      "G. Stevens-Johnson syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient most likely has scarlet fever. Scarlet fever is caused by strains of Group A streptococcus that\nproduce erythrogenic exotoxins. It has the same mode of transmission and age of distribution as\nstreptococcal pharyngitis. The illness may follow a streptococcal pharyngitis, wound infections, burns, or\nstreptococcal skin infection. It begins acutely after an incubation period of 1 to 7 days. Initial symptoms\ninclude fever, chills, toxicity, abdominal pain, and pharyngitis. The rash initially appears on the neck, axillae,\nand groin within 12 to 48 hours, and subsequently generalizes within 24 hours. The rash characteristically\nhas a punctate or finely papular texture which is sometimes readily palpable; hence, the \"sandpaper-like\"\ndescription. The pharynx is typically erythematous, swollen and possibly covered with gray-white exudates.\nThe area around the mouth appears pale in comparison with the extremely red cheeks, giving the\nappearance of \"circumoral pallor.\" Towards the end of the first week, desquamation begins in the face,\nprogresses down the trunk, and finally extends to the hands and feet. The treatment is Penicillin (drug of\nchoice). Erythromycin, clindamycin, and first generation cephalosporins are good alternatives for patients\nwho are allergic to penicillin.\n(Choice A) Kawasaki disease is a probable differential diagnosis, due to the patient's lymphadenopathy,\nchanges in the buccal mucosa (pharyngitis and strawberry tongue), and rash; however, to make this\ndiagnosis, at least one additional criterion must be present. That is, there should either be changes in the\nperipheral extremities or bilateral conjunctival injection. In a real clinical setting, it may be difficult to\ndistinguish scarlet fever from Kawasaki disease, especially in children who are carriers of Group A\nStreptococcus; however, a rapid response to penicillin therapy generally confirms the diagnosis of scarlet\nfever.\n(Choice B) Staphylococcal scalded skin is caused by exfoliative strains of S. aureus, and is characterized by\nthe development of superficial flaccid bullae followed by an extensive exfoliation of the skin. It is most\ncommon in infancy, and rarely occurs beyond five years of age.\n(Choice D) Herpangina is a throat infection caused by enteroviruses, especially Coxsackie A. It is\ncharacterized by a high fever and a severe sore throat that may result in a complete inability to swallow,\nsometimes necessitating IV hydration. Ulcerative lesions are found on the palate, tonsils, and pharynx.\nSometimes, these lesions appear on the palms and soles, in which case the infection is called\nhand-foot-mouth disease.\n(Choice E) Mononucleosis can also present with exudative pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy; however the\ncharacteristic rash of this patient makes scarlet fever the more likely diagnosis.\n(Choice F) Toxic epidermal necrolysis is another form of cutaneous hypersensitivity that is sometimes\nconsidered to be a variant of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Most cases are secondary to medications, such\nas sulfa drugs, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs. Similar to staphylococcal-scalded syndrome, it presents with\nextensive erythema, tenderness, and blister formation, followed by denudation of the epidermis. Mucous\nmembranes are severely affected, and shedding of the nails may occur.\n(Choice G) Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe variant of erythema multiforme. It is characterized by\nskin lesions of erythema multiforme (target lesions), followed by inflammatory bullae of two or more mucous\nmembranes. Sometimes, the GI, respiratory, or GU tracts may also be involved.\nEducational Objective:\nScarlet fever is characterized by fever, toxicity, pharyngitis, sandpaper-like rash, circumoral pallor and\nstrawberry tongue. It is caused by strains of Group A streptococcus that produce erythrogenic exotoxins.\nPenicillin V is the drug of choice."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is referred to your office for the evaluation of a white eye reflex. His mother suspects a\nhearing problem because he does not respond when she calls out his name. The physical examination\nreveals a continuous, machinery murmur over the right 2nd intercostal space and purple lesions on his arms\nand chest. The initial investigations reveal thrombocytopenia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Sturge Weber syndrome",
      "B. Retinoblastoma",
      "C. Congenital rubella infection",
      "D. Congenital CMV infection",
      "E. Congenital Toxoplasma infection"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The child most likely has congenital rubella infection, which is transmitted via the placenta. The causative\norganism is Toga virus. Maternal infection manifests after an incubation period of 14 to 21 days with mild\nsymptoms such as rash, arthralgias and generalized lymphadenopathy. Since rubella infection confers\npermanent immunity, only primary infection in the pregnant woman carries the risk of fetal disease. The\nseverity of fetal disease depends on the time of pregnancy when the transmission took place. Infections of\nearly pregnancy are the most severe, and the associated adverse outcomes include spontaneous abortion\nand congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). If transmission occurs in the first 4 weeks of pregnancy, the risk of\ndeveloping CRS is 50%. This risk drops to 1% if transmission occurs in the third trimester. The features of\nCRS may include IUGR, deafness, cardiac malformations (e.g. patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal\ndefects), microphthalmia, cataract, retinopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and CNS\ninvolvement. Chronic infection may result in growth retardation, radiolucent bone disease, jaundice,\nhepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and purple skin lesions (\"blueberry muffin spots\").\nMaternal infection is confirmed by the presence of IgM to rubella virus, or a fourfold increase in IgG on two\nserum samples obtained two weeks apart. In the infant, the diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of IgM or\npersistence of IgG beyond the age of 6 months. Prevention of congenital rubella is primarily achieved by\nadministration of rubella vaccine to all females of childbearing age. If the immunologic status of a pregnant\nwoman is unknown, rubella titers should be obtained in the first trimester. Immunization should not be\nperformed in pregnancy because of a theoretical risk for the fetus, and such women should be advised to\navoid anyone with possible rubella infection.\n(Choice A) Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disease characterized by a port-wine stain on the\ntrigeminal nerve distribution, mental retardation, seizures and glaucoma. The skin lesions of the above\npatient (purple and located in multiple areas of the body) are not characteristic of Sturge-Weber syndrome.\n(Choice B) Retinoblastoma may present with a unilateral or bilateral white light reflex with or without\nexophthalmos; however, it is not accompanied by deafness or cardiac anomalies, as in CRS.\n(Choices D and E) Congenital CMV and Toxoplasma are similar in many ways. They both manifest with\nhydrocephalus, cerebral calcification, chorioretinitis, microcephaly and microphthalmia. Although rubella may\nalso present with such symptoms, the presence of specific symptoms such as deafness, cardiac anomalies\nand blueberry muffin spots clarify the correct diagnosis.\nEducational Objective:\nRemember the classic triad of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) - sensorineural deafness, cardiac\nmalformations (e.g. PDA and ASD), and cataracts. CRS occurs most commonly when transmission\noccurs in the first 4 weeks of pregnancy."

    "question": "A 6-year-old girl is diagnosed with Bordetella pertussis infection after an outbreak in the day-care center. She\nis prescribed erythromycin for 14 days. She lives with her parents and 13-year-old sister whose\nimmunizations are up to date. What is the most appropriate way to limit the risk of infection in household\ncontacts?",
    "options": [
      "A. Administer pertussis immunization to all household contacts",
      "B. Prescribe erythromycin for 14 days to all household contacts",
      "C. Prescribe erythromycin for 14 day to the mother and father only",
      "D. Administer pertussis immunization to the parents only",
      "E. Keep the child hospitalized until symptoms disappear",
      "F. Prophylaxis in close contacts is not required"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Pertussis is a highly contagious disease despite immunization. Transmission occurs via respiratory\ndroplets. Infection and vaccination both confer only transient protection. However, despite immunization, over\n75% of household contacts will develop some symptoms of pertussis if exposed. The recommended first\nline treatment for pertussis is a macrolide antibiotic such as erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin.\nTreatment during the catarrhal stage may help shorten the disease duration. Treatment after the catarrhal\nstage will not shorten the disease course, but will help decrease transmission. Due to the high rate of\ntransmission, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all close contacts despite their vaccination status.\nMacrolide antibiotics are the preferred prophylactic treatment. In addition to prophylaxis, close contacts\nshould receive the pertussis vaccination according to the recommended immunization schedule if they are\nnot already fully immunized.\n(Choices A and D) Pertussis immunization now involves an acellular vaccine, since this has\nbeen associated with less adverse effects than whole-cell vaccine. It is given to all children in 5 doses along\nwith diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. Three doses are given in infancy (at 2, 4 and 6 months), one dose\nbetween 15 and 18 months, and the last one between 4 and 6 years. In children <7 years of age who have\nreceived less than 4 doses of pertussis vaccines, an additional dose is given to complete the recommended\nseries.\n(Choice E) The treatment of pertussis is erythromycin for 14 days. Respiratory isolation is maintained only\nduring the first 5 days of erythromycin therapy. Hospitalization is indicated in infants <= 3 months, those\nbetween 3 to 6 months with severe paroxysms, and if significant complications occur. Although albuterol and\ncorticosteroids have been used to reduce the severity of symptoms, no rigorous trials have been conducted\nto confirm their effectiveness.\nEducational objective:\nFor pertussis prevention, all close contacts should be given erythromycin for 14 days, regardless of age,\nimmunizations, or symptoms."

    "question": "A term, newborn male infant is being examined. He has a flat face, upward and slanted palpebral fissures,\nepicanthal folds, a simian crease, short and broad hands, high arched palate, and hypotonia. He was born to\na 38-year-old Caucasian mother. What diagnosis is consistent with these findings?",

      "D. Three copies of chromosome 8",
      "E. Autosomal monosomy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient's manifestations (i.e., flat face, upward and slanted palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, a simian\ncrease, short and broad hands, high arched palate, and hypotonia) are characteristic for Down's syndrome\n(trisomy 21), which is the most common of all trisomies. This condition is usually caused by meiotic\nnondisjunction, and its likelihood increases with maternal age. Other manifestations include speckled irises\n(Brushfield spots), mental and growth retardation, pelvic dysplasia, hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the\n5th finger, intestinal atresia, high arched palate, and cardiac malformations. The diagnosis is confirmed by\nobtaining the patient's karyotype.\n(Choice B) Patients with trisomy 18 or Edward's syndrome typically present with low birth weight, closed\nfists (with the index finger overlapping the 3rd digit, and the 5th digit overlapping the 4th), narrow hips with\nlimited abduction, short sternum, rocker-bottom feet, microcephaly, prominent occiput, micrognathia, cardiac\nand renal malformations, and mental retardation. It is much less common than Down's syndrome, and\napproximately 95% of patients die in their 1st year of life. This patient's manifestations are not characteristic\nof trisomy 18.\n(Choice C) Patients with trisomy 13 or Patau's syndrome typically present with cleft lip, flexed fingers with\npolydactyly, ocular hypotelorism, bulbous nose, low-set malformed ears, small abnormal skull, cerebral\nmalformation, microphthalmia, cardiac malformations, scalp defects, hypoplastic or absent ribs, visceral and\ngenital anomalies. None of these findings is present in the above case.\n(Choice D) Trisomy 8 is a very rare condition which presents with long face, high prominent forehead, wide\nupturned nose, thick everted lower lip, micro-retrognathia, low-set ears, high arched and sometimes cleft\npalate. Osteoarticular anomalies are common. You do not need to remember this one for the USMLE, as it\nhas a very low chance of appearing (as the answer) in the exam.\n(Choice E) It is highly improbable (if not impossible) for this patient to have an autosomal monosomy\nbecause all complete autosomal monosomies are lethal early in development.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients with Down's syndrome or trisomy 21 present with flat face, upward and slanted palpebral fissures,\nepicanthal folds, simian crease, short and broad hands, hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the 5th fingers,\nand high arched palate."

      "D. Constitutional growth delay",
      "E. Deficiency of pancreatic enzymes",
      "F. Inadequate dietary intake"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that is more common in Caucasian people. The cause is\na defect in the CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein, which leads to\nimpaired chloride transport in tissues and consequent multi-system involvement, particularly: (1) increased\nsalt content in sweat gland secretions, and (2) thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, reproductive\ntract, and liver. The patient may have pulmonary manifestations, which begins as a persistent, productive\ncough, and progresses to obstructive airway disease. A deficiency of pancreatic enzymes leads to fat and\nprotein malabsorption, thereby causing bulky, greasy, foul-smelling stools and subsequent deficiency of\nfat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). Vitamin A deficiency presents as dry skin, and Vitamin K deficiency\npresents as epistaxis. Failure to thrive is the result of chronic malabsorption from pancreatic insufficiency.\nOther possible presentations are meconium ileus at birth and infertility.\n(Choice A) Lactose intolerance is characterized by abdominal cramping, bloating and diarrhea after the\nintake of lactose-containing products. It does not present with a productive cough.\n(Choice B) Although there should always be a high suspicion for child abuse, parental neglect in this case\nis a less likely diagnosis. The diarrhea and cough cannot be explained by parental neglect.\n(Choice C) Chronic parasitic infection may be responsible for this patient's diarrhea, but not his cough.\n(Choices D and F) Constitutional growth delay and inadequate dietary intake are probable differential\ndiagnoses of this patient's failure to thrive, but these cannot explain the patient's cough and diarrhea.\nEducational Objective:\nCystic fibrosis can present as failure to thrive due to fat and protein malabsorption from a pancreatic\ninsufficiency."

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Asthma is characterized by airway hyperreactivity, bronchospasm and inflammation. It is a common illness\nin childhood, and approximately 10% of children present to the ED with unremitting asthma (i.e., continuous\nwheezing despite adequate treatment). Of these patients, fewer than 10% require mechanical ventilation;\nhowever hospitalization is mandatory. In this case, the child has a \"silent chest\" or absent air entry, and\ncontinues to desaturate despite prednisone treatment; therefore, the best option is hospitalization and\nmechanical ventilation.\n(Choice A) Theophylline is an option when wheezing is severe; however, the agent must be given\nintravenously and levels must be monitored since the drug has a tendency to increase the heart rate. For\nacute status asthmaticus, theophylline does not help much.\n(Choice B) Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure when the upper airways are obstructed. It is nearly\nalways an elective procedure, and never done to relieve asthma.\n(Choice D) Racemic epinephrine may help a little in moderate asthma, but when the condition is severe, its\nadministration will just delay the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Racemic epinephrine has a better role in\nthe management of croup.\n(Choice E) Antibiotics are not indicated if there is no evidence of infection.\nEducational Objective:\nKnow when to intubate a patient. Mechanical ventilation is indicated in a patient with severe asthma\nexacerbation that is unresponsive to medications."

Seventy-five percent\nof patients with Meningococcus meningitis present with a petechial rash that is prominent on the axilla,\nwrists, flanks and ankles. It appears within 24 hours of the infection, and the patient generally appears sick.\n(Choice B) Haemophilus influenza generally affects 6- to 48-month-old children. It may cause meningitis,\nbut without the rash. It may also cause rhinorrhea, fever, epiglottis, and ear infections. The antigen is easily\ndetected in the serum and CSF.\n(Choice C) Cytomegalovirus can cause a mononucleosis type picture with high fevers, fatigue, malaise,\nsplenomegaly and pharyngitis. It usually does not cause meningitis, nor does it present with a rash.\nImmunocompromised individuals have a poor prognosis.\n(Choice D) Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. It is usually acquired in the late summer months after\nan Ixodes sp. tick bite. It typically presents with skin rash (i.e., erythema chronicum migrans), headaches,\nfevers, chills and malaise. The skin rash is very characteristic (i.e., well-circumscribed borders that gets\nlarger in size with time). The disease is also seen in adults, and can cause meningitis.\n(Choice E) Listeria can cause meningitis in the newborn when it is transmitted vaginally, but it does not\npresent with a rash. Another mode of transmission is ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese from\ninfected cows. Its incidence is increased in immunosuppressed and diabetic patients.\n(Choice F) Group-B streptococcus is the most common cause of meningitis in infants. It is usually acquired\nfrom the mother during childbirth. It is not associated with a rash, and is quite unlikely in an 18-month-old.\n(Choice G) Even though pneumococcus is the most common organism responsible for meningitis, it does\nnot cause a rash.\n(Choice H) Herpes causes temporal lobe encephalitis, rather than typical meningitis.

    "answer": "G",
    "explanation": "The child is most likely suffering from measles (rubeola). Prodromes consist of fever, non-productive cough,\ncoryza, non-purulent conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots. Koplik spots are pathognomonic of measles, and\nare bluish-white lesions which sometimes appear like table salt crystals on the erythematous buccal mucous\nmembranes, opposite to the first and second upper molars, and sometimes on the inner conjunctivae and\nvaginal mucosa. The patient had all these features, and her rash was in the initial stages involving only the\nface; however, it is just a matter of time (next 24 hrs) before it will appear on the trunk and extremities. Lab\nfindings include leukopenia and lymphopenia. Proteinuria may be seen occasionally. The diagnosis is mostly\nclinical and can be supported by a fourfold rise in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer. It is very important\nto differentiate measles from other viral febrile rashes.\n(Choice A) Atypical measles occurs in persons who have previously received inactivated measles vaccine\n(the measles vaccine available now is a live one). This form is potentially life-threatening, and is\ncharacterized by atypical rash (not maculopapular), the absence of Koplik spots, arthritis, hepatitis and lung\ninvolvement. Edema of the hands and feet may occur. This patient had Koplik spots and no history of\nprevious vaccination with inactivated vaccine. Furthermore since the inactivated vaccine was available in the\n1960's, you won't see a patient with atypical measles who is 15 months old!\n(Choice B) Chlamydial keratoconjunctivitis refers to two diseases, trachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis.\nBoth diseases are limited to the conjunctiva.\n(Choice C) Erythema infectiosum or fifth disease is caused by human parvovirus B19. Children have\ndifferent presentations and develop a rash with a \"slapped cheeks\" appearance. Fever is not present or very\nmild in this disease.\n(Choice D) Human herpes virus 8 is a herpes virus which causes Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with AIDS.\n(Choice E) Kawasaki's disease or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome usually occurs in children below\nthe age of 10. The disease is characterized by fever >= 5 days, mucous membrane changes (injected\npharynx, fissured lips, strawberry tongue), extremity changes (edema, erythema and desquamation), at least\none cervical lymph node >= 1.5 cm, and polymorphous rash.\n(Choice F) Minimal change disease is a cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It is characterized by\nnephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and edema. No rash appears in this disease.\n(Choice H) Patients with scarlet fever have pharyngitis, fever, and a sandpaper-like erythematous rash,\nwhich may be followed by a fine desquamation. Strawberry tongue may be present, as in Kawasaki disease.\n(Choice I) Exanthema subitum, sixth disease, or roseola is caused by human herpes virus 6. It is primarily\nseen in infants and is characterized by a high fever for three to four days. It is the most common cause of\ninfantile febrile seizures. Unlike fifth disease, the rash spares the face and appears after the fever.\n(Choice J) Pharyngoconjunctival fever is caused by an adenovirus and consists of pharyngitis, mostly\nunilateral, non-purulent conjunctivitis, and fever. No rash appears in this condition.\n(Choice L) Rubella is a mild disease which has mild prodromal symptoms in children. Mild degree of fever\nand malaise, along with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, will be present. There may be patchy erythema\non the throat and palate. The rash is fine, pink, maculopapular, and occurs in rapid progression (3 days) from\nface to trunk, giving it the name of 3-day measles. Leukopenia may also be observed.\nEducational Objective:\nThe prodrome of measles may include Koplik spots, a pathognomonic finding which appears as bluish white\nlesions on the erythematous buccal mucosa opposite to the first and second upper molars, and sometimes\non the inner conjunctivae and vaginal mucosa. In the United States, even a single case of suspected\nmeasles should be reported to the local health authorities."

    "question": "A 15-month-old Caucasian boy is brought to the office due to fever for the past 3 days. He was born after an\nuncomplicated pregnancy. His growth and development had been normal until 6 months of age, after which\nhe had 4 episodes of otitis media and two episodes of pneumococcal pneumonia. Physical examination\nreveals a febrile, irritable boy who is constantly pulling his ears. He has bulging tympanic membranes on the\nright side, with poor light reflex. His total immunoglobulin level is 40mg/dL. His serum concentrations of IgA,\nIgM, IgD, and IgG are decreased. The smear reveals an absence of circulating B cells. What is the most\nlikely diagnosis?",

      "D. Selective IgA deficiency",
      "E. DiGeorge syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, is an X-linked recessive\ndisorder characterized by a defect in tyrosine kinase in B cells. This patient's presentation is classic: a male\ninfant who is initially asymptomatic until 6-9 months of age, after which he begins to experience recurrent\npyogenic (S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae) infections. The maternal IgG antibodies are responsible for\nkeeping the infant free from infections in the first 6-9 months of life. The diagnosis is confirmed by decreased\nserum concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE, along with absent or markedly decreased B cells on the\nsmear.\n(Choice B) Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or acquired hypogammaglobulinemia can have a\nsomewhat similar presentation to Bruton's agammaglobulinemia; however, patients with the former usually\nmanifest with less severe symptoms at a later age (approximately 15- to 35-years-old). The serum\nconcentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE may also be decreased, but there is no absence or decrease in the\nnumber of circulating B cells. Furthermore, there is no sexual predominance in CVID.\n(Choice C) Transient hypogammaglobulinemia (THI) is characterized by decreased IgG levels, normal IgA\nlevels, and variable IgM levels. These immunoglobulin levels all normalize by 6-11 months of age.\n(Choice D) Selective IgA deficiency is characterized by decreased IgA levels (less than 50mcg/ml) with\nnormal serum concentrations of other immunoglobulins (although IgG2 subclass deficiency may occur).\nThere is no other evidence of any immune defects. Patients commonly present with respiratory,\ngastrointestinal, and genitourinary infections.\n(Choice E) The typical patient with DiGeorge syndrome is a neonate with hypocalcemic seizures. The\nunderlying pathology is a defect in the development of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches, thereby leading to\nhypoplastic or aplastic thymus and parathyroid glands. Other congenital defects that may occur with this\nsyndrome are esophageal atresia, congenital heart disease, anomalies of the great vessels, mandibular\nhypoplasia, and low-set, notched ears.\nEducational Objective:\nThe typical patient with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a male infant with recurrent pneumonia and otitis\nmedia after 6 to 9 months of age. The levels of all the serum immunoglobulins and circulating B-cells are\ndecreased."

    ],
    "answer": "G",
    "explanation": "Adolescent onset of hirsutism and virilism, particularly in the presence of normal menstruations, along with\nelevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone, is diagnostic of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\nIncreased LH/FSH ratio could be due to polycystic ovarian disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n(CAH), but the presence of elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone makes the diagnosis of CAH more\nlikely. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is associated with normal DHEA levels.\nThe normal DHEA levels makes adrenal carcinoma or adenoma unlikely.\nOvarian androgen tumors are associated with increased testosterone and suppressed LH levels.\nPatients with Cushing's disease or Cushing's syndrome will have other features like progressive\nobesity and menstrual irregularities. Hirsutism will be due to elevated adrenal androgens (DHEA), and 17-OH\nprogesterone levels will be normal in such patients.\nIdiopathic hirsutism is due to excessive conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the hair follicle.\nIn such cases, there is usually a positive family history and occurs in females of Mediterranean origin. Levels\nof 17-OH progesterone will be normal in such cases and there will be no evidence of virilization.\nEducational Objective:\nAdolescent onset of hirsutism and virilism, with normal menstruations and elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone,\nare diagnostic of congenital adrenal hyperplasia."

    "question": "A 2-week-old male infant is brought to the office by his 28-year-old primiparous mother for the evaluation of\njaundice that was noted two days ago. The infant's stool has a lighter color. He is exclusively breastfed. The\npregnancy was uncomplicated, and prenatal screening tests for TORCH organisms were all negative. The\ninfant was delivered vaginally with no complications. His temperature is 37.2 C (99F), pulse is 140/min,\nrespirations are 50/min, and capillary refill is <= 2 sec.

      "D. Gilbert syndrome",
      "E. Crigler-Najjar syndrome",
      "F. Erythroblastosis fetalis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's history of jaundice in association with light colored stools, hepatomegaly, and direct\n(conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, is indicative of neonatal cholestasis and impaired hepatic excretion of\nbilirubin, either by extrahepatic obstruction or liver cell injury. Among the choices given, only biliary atresia\ncan cause neonatal cholestasis. In a real clinical setting with conjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, priority\nshould be given to conditions that require prompt diagnosis and treatment, such as sepsis, endocrinopathy\n(hypothyroidism), and nutritional hepatotoxicity caused by metabolic diseases (galactosemia, tyrosinemia).\nAfter these diagnoses are ruled out, the final step is to differentiate biliary atresia from neonatal hepatitis.\nThe purpose of this question is not so much to know the causes of conjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia,\nas it is to keep in mind that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (>= 2 mg/dL) is an indication for evaluating neonatal\njaundice, even if the infant is otherwise normal.\nOther indications of the evaluation of neonatal jaundice include:\n1. Jaundice that appears in the first 24 - 36 hours of life.\n2. Serum bilirubin rising at a rate faster than 5 mg/dL/24 hours.\n3. Serum bilirubin greater than 12 mg/dL in full-term (especially in the absence of risk factors) or 10- 14\nmg/dL in preterm infants.\n4. Jaundice persists after 10-14 days of life.\n5. The presence of signs or symptoms.\n(Choice A) Breast-milk jaundice also appears in the second week of life, however, the hyperbilirubinemia that\noccurs is indirect (unconjugated). The unconjugated bilirubin levels may rise as high as 10-30 mg/dL. Levels\ndrop rapidly as soon as breastfeeding is stopped, and the infant is given milk formula for 1-2 days. After 2-3\ndays the breastfeeding can be resumed, and usually there is no return of the hyperbilirubinemia. Although it\nis a benign condition in some instances, phototherapy may be indicated.\n(Choice C) Physiologic jaundice consists of moderate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 12-14 mg/dL) that\nappears after the first 24 hours of life and resolves before the end of the first week. It is a benign condition\nand is more common in preterm infants, infants of diabetic mothers, and infants of Asian or Native American\ndescent.\n(Choice D and E) Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert's syndrome are inherited deficiencies of UDP-glucuronyl\ntransferase that result in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. In Gilbert's syndrome, the deficiency is mild, and\npatients are asymptomatic due to the mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia. In Crigler-Najjar syndrome, the\nenzyme is absent; patients present early in life, and die within their first few years.\n(Choice F) Erythroblastosis fetalis is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and anemia. The\ndiagnosis is suggested by a positive Coombs’ test. In this case, the negative Coomb's test and conjugated\nhyperbilirubinemia of the patient rules out this diagnosis.\nEducational Objective:\nNeonatal jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is suggestive of neonatal cholestasis and warrants\nfurther evaluation. Know the indications for the evaluation of neonatal jaundice."

The infant was delivered vaginally at full term, assisted with forceps, and weighed 9 lbs. The Apgar\nscores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Oxygen administration by mask does not relieve the\ncyanosis. Further examination reveals tachypnea, subcostal retractions, a normal S1, single and loud S2,\nand no murmur. Which of the following is the most probable cause of the infant's cyanosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transposition of great vessels",
      "B. Atrial septal defect",
      "C. Coarctation of aorta",

      "E. Patent ductus arteriosus",
      "F. Tetralogy of Fallot",
      "G. Dextrocardia"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Transposition of great vessels is a cyanotic heart disease which presents with cyanosis in the first 24 hours\nof life. It is commonly seen in infants of diabetic mothers and in males. The aorta arises from the right\nventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. As a result, deoxygenated blood coming from the\nbody goes to the right atrium and the right ventricle, and is cycled back to the body through the aorta.\nOxygenated blood from the lungs is returned to the lungs by the left side of the heart through the pulmonary\nartery.\nDuring intrauterine life, the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus provide mixing of the deoxygenated and\noxygenated blood, resulting in an almost normal oxygenation of the fetal circulation; however, after birth, the\nforamen ovale and ductus arteriosus begin to close, leading to decreased mixing and poor oxygenation. The\nneonate then presents with cyanosis and tachypnea within the first few hours of life. X-ray of the chest may\nbe normal initially, but may show some evidence of increased pulmonary blood flow after 1 to 2 weeks.\nEchocardiography confirms the diagnosis. Maintaining the patency of the ductus arteriosus is important for\nsurvival. Surgical treatment is definitive.\n(Choice F) Tetralogy of Fallot commonly presents with cyanosis a few years after birth.\n(Choices B, C, D, E and G) Atrial septal defect, coarctation of aorta, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus\narteriosus and dextrocardia are all acyanotic heart diseases.\nEducational Objective:\nTransposition of the great vessels is the most common cyanotic heart disease which presents with cyanosis\nin the first 24 hours of life. It is commonly seen in infants of diabetic mothers and in males.\n*Extremely high yield question for the USMLE!!"

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Suspect Diamond-Blackfan syndrome (DBS), also called congenital hypoplastic anemia, in a child with\nmacrocytic anemia, low reticulocyte count, and congenital anomalies. The majority of cases are sporadic,\nalthough dominant and recessive inheritance is found in 15 percent of cases. The primary pathology is an\nintrinsic defect of erythroid progenitor cells which results in increased apoptosis (programmed cell death).\nThe condition often presents with pallor in the neonatal period. Over 90 percent of cases are diagnosed\nwithin the first year of life, with the average age of diagnosis being 3 months. Congenital anomalies (as\ndescribed in this case) are present in over 50 percent of cases. The macrocytic anemia of DBS is distinct\nfrom that of megaloblastic anemia because there is no hypersegmentation of the nucleus in neutrophils and\nother blood cells in the former. Electrophoresis reveals elevated fetal Hb levels. Chromosomal studies are\nnormal. Therapy is mainly corticosteroids. For unresponsive patients, transfusion therapy is indicated.\n(Choice A) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia\nand hypogammaglobulinemia.\n(Choice B) Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood is a pure red cell aplasia without macrocytosis. Most\ncases are diagnosed after 1 year of age and there are no associated congenital anomalies.\n(Choice C) Idiopathic aplastic anemia is an acquired disease that results in pancytopenia. It may be due to\nchemicals (e.g., benzene, phenylbutazone), drugs (e.g., chloramphenicol, sulfonamides), infectious agents\n(e.g. viral hepatitis) or ionizing radiation.\n(Choice D) Fanconi's anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive\npancytopenia and macrocytosis. The average age at diagnosis is 8 years. Associated deformities include\ncafe-au-lait spots, microcephaly, microphthalmia, short stature, horseshoe kidneys and absent thumbs (not\ntriphalangeal thumbs).\nEducational Objective:\nDBS is a macrocytic pure red aplasia associated with several congenital anomalies such as short stature,\nwebbed neck, cleft lip, shielded chest and triphalangeal thumbs."

      "E. Femoral fracture"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The most probable cause of this patient's complaints is aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. Pain in the hip\nthat gradually progresses is a common clinical presentation. This disabling complication of sickle cell\ndisease is relatively common, and has also been described with other hemoglobinopathies, such as SC\nhemoglobin disease. Other non-traumatic causes include chronic corticosteroid therapy, SLE, alcoholism,\nand Gaucher's disease.\nThe pathology involves occlusion of end arteries supplying the femoral head, bone necrosis, and eventual\ncollapse of the periarticular bone and cartilage. The femoral head has two main sources of blood supply -\nascending arteries and the foveal artery, which lie within the ligamentum teres. The foveal artery is patent\nearly in life, but may become obliterated in older patients. This explains why aseptic necrosis of the femoral\nhead is uncommon in children.\n(Choices A and B) Osteomyelitis is usually accompanied by high fever, and typically has an acute onset.\n(Choice C) A joint effusion may develop in patients with sickle cell disease, but the characteristic local\nwarmth and tenderness are not present in this patient. Furthermore, the typical features of septic arthritis\n(i.e. fever, severe restriction of movement in all directions, inflammatory signs, and bacteremia) are also not\npresent in this patient.\n(Choice E) A femoral fracture is unlikely without a history of trauma and with a gradually progressive course.\nEducational Objective:\nAseptic necrosis of the femoral head is a common complication of sickle cell disease.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Nursemaid's elbow, also called as subluxed radial head, is one of the most common elbow injuries in children\nbetween the ages of 1-5 years. It occurs when infants or children are lifted or pulled by the hand or arm. This\npulling injury occurs when the radial head slips through parts of the annular ligament. Physical examination\nreveals no significant swelling or angular deformity, and the child typically keeps the affected arm in a\npronated position, and refuses (cries out in pain) attempted forearm supination. Rotating the hand and\nforearm to a supinated position with pressure over the radial head usually reduces the annular ligament with\nan audible click, and restores full, normal use of the extremity. The response to reduction of the displaced\nligament is diagnostic.\n(Choice A) Panner disease is osteochondrosis of the capitellum. The typical patient is an adolescent who\nis actively engaged in sport activities that involve throwing, and the common complaints\ninclude pain, crepitation and loss of motion of the arm (particularly pronation and supination).\n(Choice C) Lateral epicondylitis, or \"tennis elbow,\" is caused by repetitive contraction of the extensor\nmuscles at their origin on the lateral epicondyle. Tenderness is elicited over the lateral epicondyle, and pain\nis felt with passive wrist flexion and resisted wrist extension.\n(Choice D) The most common elbow dislocation is posterior dislocation, which is caused by falling\nbackward onto the outstretched arm with the elbow extended. An obvious deformity is noted, with the\nolecranon process displaced prominently behind the distal humerus. This patient neither has a history of fall\nnor a deformity.\nEducational Objective:\nNursemaid's elbow occurs when infants or children are lifted or pulled by the hand or arm. The mechanism\nof the injury involves radial head subluxation. The child typically keeps the hand in a pronated position, and\nrefuses (cries out in pain) attempted forearm supination."

He recently had a mild sore throat which quickly resolved, but now seems to\nhave recurred and have worsened. He also had a low-grade fever last week, but no chills. Physical\nexamination reveals a pericardial friction rub and subcutaneous nodules over the hands. Laboratory studies\nshow an elevated ESR. What is the most likely cause of this child's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Group A streptococcus",
      "B. Mycoplasma pneumoniae",
      "C. Respiratory syncytial virus",
      "D. Paramyxovirus",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Suspect rheumatic fever in a child with sore throat, low-grade fever, pericarditis, arthritis, chorea and\nsubcutaneous nodules. Other features include erythema marginatum, elevated ESR and prolonged PR\ninterval on EKG. Rheumatic fever is caused by is group A streptococcus. Diagnosis is made if two major or\none major and two minor criteria (Jones criteria) are satisfied, in addition to evidence of recent streptococcal\ninfection (via detection of antistreptolysin antibodies, cultures and other various antigen detection kits).\nMajor Criteria Minor Criteria\nPolyarthritis Fever\nCarditis Arthralgia\nChorea Previous rheumatic fever\nSubcutaneous nodules Elevated ESR\nErythema marginatum Prolonged PR interval\nThe treatment is benzathine penicillin G. Patients with chorea, pericarditis and arthritis may require additional\ntherapy with anti-epileptics, salicylates, and codeine, respectively.\n(Choice B) Mycoplasma infection is usually seen in young people. It presents with a dry cough, pharyngitis,\nbullous myringitis and pneumonia. General malaise and weakness are common. It very rarely presents with\na rash or subcutaneous nodules. Chorea does not occur. The treatment is erythromycin.\n(Choice C) Respiratory syncytial virus affects young children, more commonly those with heart defects. It\nproduces a low-grade fever with cough, but not skin rash or subcutaneous nodules. It is treated with\naerosolized ribavirin.\n(Choice D) Paramyxovirus is the cause of parotitis (mumps), and occasionally epididymo-orchitis. Other\nmanifestations are encephalitis and pancreatitis. It does not present with a rash.\n(Choice E) Epstein-Barr virus can cause general malaise, pharyngitis, cervical adenopathy and\nsplenomegaly. In rare instances, encephalitis and spleen rupture may ensue. The virus has a long\nincubation period, but is easily identified by antibody testing. It does not present with a rash or subcutaneous\nnodules.\n(Choice F) Although Coxsackie virus is the most common organism responsible for pericarditis, it does not\npresent with chorea, subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect rheumatic fever in a child with sore throat, fever, pericarditis, erythema marginatum, arthritis,\nchorea, and subcutaneous nodules.

    "question": "A 6-year-old Caucasian male is brought to your office with a two-week history of right shoulder pain. Physical\nexamination reveals localized swelling below the shoulder joint, and x-ray shows a single lytic lesion in the\nright humeral head. Laboratory analyses show mild hypercalcemia but are otherwise within normal limits.\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Osteoporosis",
      "B. Sarcoidosis",
      "C. Langerhans histiocytosis",
      "D. Primary hyperparathyroidism",
      "E. Osteogenesis imperfecta"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The differential for a lytic bone lesion in a child is broad, including infectious (Brodie abscess from\nosteomyelitis), endocrine (hyperparathyroid osteitis fibrosa cystica), neoplastic (Ewing sarcoma, Langerhans\ncell histiocytosis, metastases) and idiopathic (benign bone cyst, aneurysmal bone cyst) etiologies. The\nconcomitant hypercalcemia in this patient narrows the differential diagnosis to hyperparathyroid state versus\nlytic bone neoplasm. Parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism, and\ntypically occurs in patients over fifty years of age. Thus, a lytic bone lesion is most likely. Of the choices\nlisted, only Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH, Langerhans cell granulomatosis, histiocytosis x) is known to\ncauses solitary, lytic, long bone lesions. Eosinophilic granuloma, the least severe form of histiocytosis x,\ngenerally presents in children and young adults as a solitary bone lesion. This lesion may be painful, have\noverlying tender swelling, and cause pathological fractures. Though these tumors can be locally destructive,\nthey typically resolve spontaneously and are therefore regarded as benign and treated conservatively.\n(Choice A) Osteoporosis does not cause lytic bone lesions or hypercalcemia.\n(Choice B) Sarcoidosis can cause bone lesions and hypercalcemia, but typically has its onset between ages\n20 and 35 years. Sarcoidosis affecting the bone tends to target the hands and feet. There are classically\nmultiple punched out cortical lesions and/or a reticulated pattern of cortical resorption.\n(Choice D) Primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma is rare in children.\n(Choice E) In most cases, osteogenesis imperfecta results from an autosomal dominant defect in Type I\ncollagen. Patients typically present with blue sclerae, diffuse cortical thinning, attenuation of trabeculae and\npathological fractures. A solitary lytic bone lesion would be unusual.\nEducational objective:\nThe differential diagnosis of a solitary, painful, lytic long bone lesion with overlying swelling and hypercalcemia\nin a child should include Langerhans cell histiocytosis as well as other neoplastic processes."

    "explanation": "This clinical scenario is typical for Friedreich ataxia, which is the most common type of spinocerebellar\nataxias. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, and its symptoms usually begin before 22 years of age.\nNeurological manifestations (e.g., gait ataxia, frequent falling, dysarthria) result from degeneration of the\nspinal tracts (spinocerebellar tracts, posterior columns, pyramidal tract). Non-neurological\nmanifestations may also occur, and these include concentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and\nskeletal deformities (e.g., scoliosis and \"hammer toes’). The median survival after disease onset rarely\nexceeds 20 years. The most common causes of death are cardiomyopathy and respiratory complications.\nCardiomyopathy develops in up to 90% of the patients.\n(Choice B) Renal failure is not characteristic of Friedreich ataxia.\n(Choice C) Diabetes develops in 10-20% of the patients with Friedreich ataxia, but it is a rare cause of death.\n(Choice D) Friedreich ataxia does not predispose to cancer.\n(Choice E) Septic shock may develop due to respiratory complications, but it is not as common as cardiac\ncomplications.\nEducational Objective:\nFriedreich ataxia is the most common type of spinocerebellar ataxias. Remember the combination of\nneurologic (ataxia, dysarthria), skeletal (scoliosis, feet deformities) and cardiac (concentric hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy) manifestations of the disease. The most common causes of death are cardiomyopathy and\nrespiratory complications.\n*Very high-yield topic for USMLE!"

      "D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the hip",
      "E. Serum rheumatoid factor"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Transient synovitis is a frequent cause of hip pain in children, typically occurring in male children ages 3-10\nyears old. The cause of transient synovitis is unknown, but the condition usually follows mild trauma or viral\ninfection. Transient inflammation of the joint synovium leads to pain and decreased range of motion.\nPatients usually have a history of a recent viral infection and present with a limp and/or unilateral hip or knee\npain. A low grade fever may be present, but patients are generally afebrile. On examination, the affected hip\nwill be flexed, slightly abducted, and externally rotated. There is mild limitation of motion. The patient may\ncomplain of pain with palpation or passive motion.\nLaboratory findings characteristic of transient synovitis include a slightly elevated white blood cell count and\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate. Four clinical criteria have been shown useful in differentiating septic arthritis\nfrom transient synovitis: white blood cell count >= 12,000/mm³; temperature >= 39°C (102°F); erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate >= 40 mm/h; and refusal to bear weight. If at least three of these four criteria are met,\nfurther work-up is indicated to rule out septic arthritis. Radiographs of the hip should be done to exclude bony\nlesions and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Widening of the joint space or an enhanced pericapsular shadow\nmay be seen with transient synovitis. Additional work-up is not usually necessary, unless the diagnosis is\nuncertain. Treatment consists of rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs). Most\npatients experience resolution of symptoms within several days, although transient synovitis may contribute\nto the development of arthritis later in life.\n(Choice B) Aspiration of the hip is not routinely performed for transient synovitis but is appropriate if an\neffusion is present and the clinical data are suggestive of septic arthritis.\n(Choice C) Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started empirically for septic arthritis pending culture\nresults, but ibuprofen and limited weightbearing are more likely to be effective in this patient.\n(Choice D) Magnetic resonance imaging of the hip is indicated if septic arthritis or osteomyelitis are\nsuspected, but is not necessary for the diagnosis of transient synovitis.\n(Choice E) Serum rheumatoid factor (RF) assays have little value in the diagnosis of juvenile systemic\nrheumatoid arthritis. When present, RF is more commonly associated with Sjögren's syndrome or early\nonset of adult type rheumatoid arthritis in teenagers.\nEducational objective:\nFour clinical criteria have been shown useful in differentiating septic arthritis from transient synovitis: white\nblood cell count >= 12,000/mm³; temperature >= 39°C (102°F); erythrocyte sedimentation rate >= 40 mm/h; and\nrefusal to bear weight. If at least three of these four criteria are met, further work-up is indicated to rule out\nseptic arthritis. Transient synovitis is treated with rest and NSAIDs."

Fulminant meningococcemia can occur after a meningococcus infection, and\napproximately 10-20% of infants present with vasomotor collapse, large petechiae and purpuric lesions. The\ncondition carries an almost 100% mortality.\n(Choice A) In meningococcemia, myocarditis does not occur. It can affect the joints, skin and brain, but the\nheart is spared.\n(Choice B) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) generally does not present in such a dramatic\nfashion. Rather, it presents with signs of hypoxia and infiltrates on chest x-rays. It is a gradual process\nwhere oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult. Most individuals require mechanical ventilation.\n(Choice C) The bone marrow is not affected by meningococcus. Individuals may show leukocytosis with a\nleftward shift.\n(Choice E) Meningococcemia does not directly affect the kidneys.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is a typical case of infant botulism. C. botulinum is the most common etiologic agent and is usually\ntransmitted through food, especially honey, which is the carrier in 1/3 of cases. In the infantile form of\nbotulism, the causative organism gains entry through the food and produces the toxin in the intestinal tract,\nwhich subsequently triggers the symptoms. It is a protease that blocks acetylcholine release. Infants\ntypically present between two weeks and nine months with constipation and poor feeding. This is followed by\nprogressive hypotonia, weakness, loss of deep tendon reflexes, cranial nerve abnormalities (impaired gag\nreflex), and respiratory difficulties. Signs of autonomic dysfunction such as hypotension and neurogenic\nbladder can occur early in the course of the disease.\n(Choice E) The infantile form of botulism is different from the adult form. In the latter, the toxin ingested per\nse produces the symptoms.\n(Choice A) Patients with meningitis are typically febrile.\n(Choice B) Autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors is a feature of myasthenia gravis, which presents\nwith early fatigability of the skeletal muscles.\n(Choice C) C difficile toxin is responsible for pseudomembranous colitis. Patients usually have diarrhea (not\nconstipation), and most cases are associated with prior antibiotic use.\n(Choice F) Ascending demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy occurs in Guillain Barre Syndrome. The\ndisease progresses in a stepwise fashion from the legs to other muscles of the body.\nEducational Objective:\nInfant botulism is transmitted by the ingestion of food contaminated with C. botulinum.

A prodrome of malaise, fever and adenopathy can usually be\nextracted from the history. The agent is spread via the saliva, and the condition usually resolves after two to\nthree weeks.\n(Choice A) Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (not Group B) is responsible for 20-25% cases of\npharyngitis in children. Group B streptococcus infections in the adult are serious. These are common in\ndiabetics and those with peripheral vascular disease. Complications include endocarditis, arthritis,\npneumonia, empyema and meningitis. It does not present with a rash after taking amoxicillin.\n(Choice C) Coxsackie virus generally produces fever, headache and stiff neck (signs of aseptic meningitis).\nIt can cause myocarditis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and herpangina (vesicles on the hard palate). It\ngenerally does not produce a rash after taking an antibiotic.\n(Choice D) Escherichia coli generally causes urinary tract infections.

    "explanation": "The patient has a very typical presentation of meconium ileus, which is characterized by bilious vomiting,\nfailure to pass meconium at birth, history of polyhydramnios, family history of cystic fibrosis, and a\ntypical appearance on abdominal x-rays. This condition is diagnostic of cystic fibrosis. Although this\npatient hasn't been screened for cystic fibrosis yet, the diagnosis is very likely, especially with his father's\nfamily history. One of the possible complications of meconium ileus is intestinal perforation. If the\nperforation occurs after birth, pneumoperitoneum will be seen on abdominal x-rays. On the other hand, if it\noccurs before birth, intraabdominal calcifications will be seen.\n(Choice C) Meconium plug syndrome has a similar presentation, but occurs in non-cystic fibrosis babies.\nIntestinal perforation does not complicate this condition.\n(Choice A) Intussusception can occur in patients with cystic fibrosis, but not this early. Its peak incidence is at\n2 years of age, and manifests as abdominal pain and red currant jelly stools.\n(Choice D) Duodenal atresia can present with bilious vomiting in a newborn with an antenatal history of\npolyhydramnios, but the \"double bubble\" appearance on x-rays is usually present.\n(Choice E) Esophageal atresia is usually present in the setting of tracheoesophageal fistula. Although it is\nsometimes seen with polyhydramnios, it is an unlikely diagnosis in this case since bilious vomiting does not\noccur with esophageal atresia.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients with cystic fibrosis may initially present with meconium ileus, which is characterized by bilious\nvomiting, failure to pass meconium at birth, and ground glass appearance on abdominal x-rays."

    "question": "A 15-month-old child is brought to the office by his mother because he cries incessantly when he is left at the\nlocal day care. His mother is concerned because he is \"a happy child at home and loves playing with his\nother siblings.\" His growth pattern is normal, and has achieved all the age-appropriate physical and mental\nmilestones. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Separation anxiety disorder",
      "B. Stranger anxiety",
      "C. Social anxiety disorder",
      "D. Autism",
      "E. Rett's disorder"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Stranger anxiety is a normal phenomenon that occurs in most infants. It is the normal distress that they\nexperience when exposed to unfamiliar people. It usually starts anywhere between 6-8 months, and peaks at\n12-15 months.\n(Choice A) Separation anxiety disorder is the excessive anxiety associated with separation from home or a\nloved one. Individuals suffering from this disorder experience extreme discomfort on or at the thought of\nseparation from an individual they are attached to. They go to extremes to avoid such situations. This could\nhave been an acceptable diagnosis in an older child, but in this child of 15 months, stranger anxiety is more\nlikely.\n(Choice C) Social anxiety or phobia is a significant fear associated with exposure to one or more social\nsituations. Exposure to the feared situations provokes extreme anxiety, and the individual makes great efforts\nto avoid them.\n(Choice D) Autism is characterized by qualitative and quantitative disturbances of communication, coupled\nwith performance of certain stereotyped activities. Individuals also tend to engage in solitary activities. These\nfeatures are not present in the abovementioned patient, who is described as \"playful with his siblings\".\n(Choice E) Rett's disorder is characterized by a deterioration of previously acquired skills, beginning at the\nage of five months. The presence of normal mental and physical milestones in the abovementioned patient\nmakes this diagnosis very unlikely.\nEducational Objective:\nStranger anxiety is the normal anxiety experienced by infants when they are exposed to unfamiliar\nindividuals. It peaks at 12-15 months."

    "question": "A mother brings her 3-month-old infant to your office for a well-baby examination. The prenatal and birth\nhistories are unremarkable. Physical examination of the infant is normal. The developmental milestones are\nappropriate for age. The mother is mildly upset because her friend's baby, approximately of the same age as\nhers, died recently in the crib. The cause remained unexplained even after autopsy. She asks for more\ninformation about this incident and asks how to prevent it. What preventive measure has dramatically\ndecreased the incidence of this condition in the United States?",
    "options": [
      "A. Sleeping infants on the side",
      "B. Sleeping infants in prone position",
      "C. Sleeping infants in supine position",
      "D. Home monitoring for apnea",
      "E. Cessation of smoking",
      "F. Bed sharing with parents"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of mortality in infants aged between 1 month and\n1 year in the United States. It is defined as the sudden, unexpected death of an infant that cannot be\nexplained by the history and a thorough post-mortem examination (i.e., review of medical history, investigation\nof the scene of death, and complete autopsy). SIDS is more frequent in infants who are male, between 2-4\nmonths of age, and of low socioeconomic status.\nIn 1992 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that infants be placed in a supine position while\nsleeping to reduce the risk of SIDS. This measure proved to be highly effective, with the annual rate of SIDS\nin the U.S. declining from 1.3-1.4/1000 live births before 1992, to 0.7/1000 live births in 1999. Similar\nimprovements have been noted in other countries.\n(Choice A) Although the risk of SIDS are decreased in side-sleeping infants, studies have shown that its\noccurrence is still twice as high than that of infants sleeping on their back.\n(Choice B) Sleeping in the prone position increases the risk of SIDS.\n(Choice D) Home monitors were widely used in the past to prevent SIDS because apnea was thought to be\nits leading cause; however, studies failed to confirm this relation.\n(Choices E and F) Modifiable risk factors which have been identified include poor prenatal care, maternal\ntobacco and alcohol use, and prenatal drug use. Interventions that may contribute in reducing the risk for\nSIDS include: (1) smoking cessation, (2) use of a crib that meets federal safety standards of softness,\nmalleability and rebreathing, (3) avoidance of overheating and over bundling, and (4) avoidance of bed\nsharing.\nManipulating the smoking factor has not resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of SIDS.\nFurthermore, it is more difficult for parents to quit smoking than to ensure a safe sleep environment for their\ninfants.\nBed sharing with the parents should be avoided because this can actually be hazardous for the infant (e.g,\nwhen parents smoke in bed or use any substance that may impair their alertness, such as alcohol and\ndrugs). Bed sharing with other persons (e.g., siblings) should also be avoided.\nEducational Objective:\nTo prevent SIDS, infants should be placed on their backs (supine position) while sleeping. Home monitors do\nnot decrease the risk of SIDS."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is caused by a toxin released from Escherichia coli. The toxin enters the\nsystemic circulation and injures the endothelial cells in the kidney. When there is progressive elevation of\nBUN and creatinine, the chances for improvement of the kidneys’ function is poor. When the kidneys are\ndamaged, the mortality is 5-10%.\n(Choice B) The liver is not directly damaged by the toxin in HUS. The jaundice seen in HUS is due to\nhemolysis, and not liver injury.\n(Choice C) The bone marrow is relatively spared from the toxin. The thrombocytopenia and anemia are due\nto intravascular destruction of the RBCs and platelets.\n(Choice D) Pneumonia is not a clinical feature of HUS\n(Choice E) Bowel obstruction does not occur with HUS.

It is the second most common muscular dystrophy in the United States. The pathology\nis distinct in that all types of muscles (i.e., smooth, striated, cardiac) are involved. The above case\npresentation is typical: the patient initially appears normal at birth, then slowly develops muscle weakness\nand progressive muscle wasting, especially in the distal muscles of the hands, posterior forearm muscles,\nand anterior compartment of the lower legs. The characteristic facial appearance is illustrated above:\ntemporal wasting, thin cheeks, and an upper lip in the shape of an inverted V. Pertinent physical findings\ninclude emaciated extremities, atrophy of the thenar and hypothenar eminences, proximal muscle weakness,\npositive Gowers sign, winged scapula, and myotonia.

    "options": [
      "A. Pyloric stenosis",
      "B. Reflux disorder",
      "C. Tracheoesophageal fistula",
      "D. Bowel obstruction",
      "E. Duodenal atresia"

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The above case is a classic example of duodenal atresia. Suspect duodenal atresia when the patient\nhas bile-stained vomitus, no abdominal distension, dehydration and Down syndrome. Vomiting usually\nbegins in the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. The mother may have a history of polyhydramnios. The typical\nabdominal x-ray finding is the \"double bubble\" sign (dilated stomach and duodenum). The treatment is\ndecompression with a nasogastric tube, correction of electrolyte abnormalities and surgery.\n(Choice A) Pyloric stenosis is most common in first-born children, and patients may have a positive family\nhistory. Features include non-bilious projectile vomiting after feeding, palpable olive-shaped abdominal mass,\nand visible gastric peristalsis. Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis is typical. The diagnosis is confirmed with\nultrasonography.\n(Choice B) Gastroesophageal reflux is common in infants, and usually occurs in a thriving baby. The\nvomiting episodes are seen after feeding, and the vomitus is not bilious and rarely contains blood. The infant\nmay present with recurrent pneumonias or cough. A 24-hour pH probe, contrast swallow study, or\nendoscopy may reveal the diagnosis.\n(Choice C) Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) usually presents in infancy with coughing, vomiting and gagging\nafter feeding. Respiratory distress is common after feeding, and frothy bubbles are seen in the oral cavity\neven after suctioning. The condition may be associated with VACTERL syndromes, and the mother may\nhave a history of polyhydramnios.\n(Choice D) Although malrotation or atresia of the bowel may also present with recurrent vomiting and\nbile-stained vomitus, the abdomen is usually distended and the typical x-ray finding includes loops of dilated\nbowel with air fluid levels.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect duodenal atresia when the patient has bile-stained vomitus, no abdominal distension, dehydration,\ndouble bubble sign, and Down syndrome.

    "options": [
      "A. Congenital Toxoplasmosis",

      "C. HIV infection",
      "D. Miliary tuberculosis",
      "E. Malabsorptive disease"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "There is currently more than 100,000 cases of AIDS in the United States. Women represent 18% of all\ncases, and among them, 85% are of childbearing age. Approximately 7,000 HIV-infected women give birth\nannually to 1000 to 2000 infected infants. For these reasons, HIV testing is standardly offered to all pregnant\nwomen in the first trimester. There is no change in the frequency of prenatal visits of the infected mother,\nunless a specific indication is present; therefore, vigilance is necessary to detect the early signs of\nopportunistic infections and any deterioration in the course of the disease. The progression of the disease is\nmonitored through regular measurements of CD4 count, and the decision for prevention of opportunistic\ninfections should be made accordingly. Invasive procedures are avoided to decrease the risk of transmission\nto the infant. Pregnant women with HIV seem to be at higher risk of infectious complications such as\npostpartum infections, opportunistic infections and sexually transmitted diseases; however, the overall\ncourse of the disease does not seem to be altered.\nIn neonates, serologic testing is not useful for HIV diagnosis because of the passage of maternal antibodies\nto the fetal circulation through the placenta. PCR, viral culture and p24 antigen testing are more appropriate;\nHIV infection is confirmed if at least two of these tests are positive. The disease progresses more rapidly in\nneonates and infants. Infected infants are generally asymptomatic at birth. The first symptoms usually\nappear in the first month and include persistent oral thrush, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.\nMore severe symptoms subsequently develop, such as intractable diarrhea, refractory infections and failure\nto thrive. Half of HIV positive children develop AIDS in the first year of life, with an average survival rate of 3\nyears.\n(Choice A) Toxoplasmosis does not manifest with thrush or an immunodeficiency syndrome. At this age,\nmental retardation, learning disabilities and chorioretinitis are more characteristic.\n(Choice B) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma manifests most commonly with abdominal symptoms such as\nabdominal distention, ascites, urinary tract obstruction and intestinal obstruction. The infant in this case has\nsigns of immunodeficiency (i.e., recurrent fever, thrush and intractable diarrhea), and may be at higher risk for\ndeveloping a lymphoma afterwards; however, the most plausible diagnosis at this time is HIV infection.\n(Choice D) Miliary tuberculosis manifests with respiratory symptoms and meningitis. Immunodeficiency is\nmore specific for HIV infection, especially since the mother's ex-boyfriend is a heroin addict.\n(Choice E) Children with malabsorptive disease do not present with immunodeficiency symptoms.\nEducational Objective:\nHIV testing is standardly offered to all pregnant women in the first trimester to prevent possible transmission\nto the infant. Persistent oral thrush, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly may be the presenting\nsymptoms of AIDS in infants."

      "D. Femoral vein",
      "E. Fluids down endotracheal tube"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Whenever intravenous access cannot be obtained in emergent pediatric cases, intraosseous access should\nbe attempted next. Intraosseous cannulation can be performed quickly in the ED, even with less than optimal\nlight, assistance and choice of equipment. Another advantage is that this technique does not require the\nprecision required for cannulation of small vessels, yet provides a cannula large enough to deliver adequate\nfluids. This route can be used in emergencies for 24 to 48 hours, at which point another intravenous route\nshould have been obtained. Associated complications such as osteomyelitis are rare. In adults, the\nintraosseous route can also be used, but their greater bone density makes it difficult to penetrate the bone.\n(Choice A) Central line placement in children and infants should only be done by highly-skilled individuals,\nand is therefore not recommended in the ED. Subclavian line placement in children is associated with a high\nincidence of complications such as pneumothorax and hemothorax.\n(Choice C) Jugular vein cut down in the ED is not recommended. This is difficult to perform in the absence\nof adequate lighting and appropriate instruments. Furthermore, the jugular vein area is not the recommended\nsite for cut down as many important structures are found in the neck area.\n(Choice D) Femoral vein cannulation can be done and is a relatively easy technique; however, many do not\nprefer this technique in children because of possible perineal contamination. Furthermore, lines placed in the\ngroin area make it difficult for patients to be mobile, and bleeding from the site is a constant problem.\n(Choice E) Fluids should never be placed down the endotracheal tube because this leads to aspiration and\nsymptoms of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Only in urgent situations should medications\nsuch as epinephrine or lidocaine be placed down the endotracheal tube.\nEducational Objective:\nWhenever intravenous access cannot be obtained in emergent pediatric cases, intraosseous access should\nbe attempted next."

    "explanation": "This cystic fibrosis patient is suffering from an acute exacerbation of lung disease, and his presentation (i.e,\nprominent shortness of breath, excessive use of accessory respiratory muscles, hypotension) is suggestive\nof a severe attack. The most common etiologic agent is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although a variety of\nother agents have been implicated (e.g, S. aureus and H. influenzae). The treatment is rapid administration\nof empiric antibiotics, and the usual choice is a combination of two agents with coverage against\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, (i.e., ceftazidime or a penicillin derivative such as ticarcillin + an aminoglycoside\nsuch as amikacin or gentamicin).\n(Choice C) The other drugs that are effective against Pseudomonas are cefepime and imipenem/cilastatin\ncombination. Imipenem/cilastatin is effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but is used as a second-line\ndrug. Double coverage (combination antibiotics) is important, because of the remarkable resistance of this\norganism to most antibiotics, and its ability to develop further resistance during the course of therapy.\n(Choice B) The addition of an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic (e.g. nafcillin or vancomycin) depends on the\nresults of the culture.\n(Choice E) Oral ciprofloxacin covers Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it is not appropriate for severe\nexacerbations, wherein intravenous antibiotics are usually employed. The new generation fluoroquinolones\n(e.g., levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) do not have good coverage against Pseudomonas.\n(Choice D) Clindamycin is effective against anaerobes, and has little role in the treatment of such patients.\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment for an acute severe exacerbation of lung disease in a cystic fibrosis patient is intravenous\nantibiotic therapy with coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (usually a combination of two drugs, such\nas penicillin/cephalosporin + aminoglycoside)."

    "explanation": "Increased gastric residues in a preterm neonate is highly suspicious for necrotizing\nenterocolitis. The condition usually presents at 3-10 days after birth, and is due to bowel wall injury resulting\nfrom perinatal asphyxia. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Treatment depends on the degree\nof bowel involvement and severity of presentation.

In this child with\nfailure to thrive, steatorrhea, and a history of neonatal jaundice, it is imperative to rule out CF. The\nsteatorrhea of this child may be due to pancreatic insufficiency. A positive sweat chloride test is diagnostic,\nbut it must be repeated twice to avoid any false positives or negatives. Genetic studies should be done when\nthe sweat test is equivocal. Prenatal screening should be offered to high-risk families. The treatment is a\nhigh-calorie diet, pancreatic enzyme replacements and fat-soluble vitamins. The current median survival is\n30 years. Complications of prolonged CF include gallstones, cirrhosis with portal hypertension and\npancreatic fibrosis.\n(Choice A) Blood cultures cannot confirm the diagnosis of CF, but may be done as part of the work-up when\nsepsis is suspected.\n(Choice B) Sputum cultures are not diagnostic of CF, but allow for the identification of the organism\nresponsible for the infections. The most common organisms are S. aureus, Pseudomonas and H. influenza.\nCF patients must be kept up to date with their immunizations.\n(Choice C) This patient's pancreatic insufficiency is most likely due to a lack of pancreatic enzymes.

    "question": "A 30-minute-old male newborn is noted to have central cyanosis. He was born to a 16-year-old white female\nat 28 weeks gestation. His respirations are rapid and shallow at 70/min. His other vital signs are stable. On\nexamination, there is audible grunting, intercostal and subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, and duskiness. On\nauscultation, fine rales are heard over the lung bases. Nasal oxygenation does not improve his cyanosis. A\nchest roentgenogram shows fine reticular granularity, predominantly in the lower lobes. Arterial blood gas\nanalysis shows evidence of hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis. What is the most likely diagnosis of this\npatient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transient tachypnea of the newborn",
      "B. Hyaline membrane disease (HMD)",
      "C. Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)",
      "D. Meconium aspiration syndrome",
      "E. Intracranial hemorrhage"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) occurs primarily in premature infants. It occurs in 60-80% of infants who\nare less than 28 weeks gestational age. The decreased production and secretion of surfactant is the primary\ncause. In the absence of surfactant, atelectasis ensues and results in perfused but non-ventilated alveoli,\nand consequently hypoxia. HMD characteristically presents as tachypnea, prominent grunting, intercostal\nand subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, and duskiness within a few minutes after birth. Breath sounds may\nbe normal or diminished with a harsh tubular quality, and on deep inspiration, fine rales may be heard,\nespecially over the lung bases posteriorly. The characteristic chest-x ray finding demonstrates fine reticular\ngranularity of the lung parenchyma. The clinical course, x-ray of the chest, blood gas and acid-base values\nhelp to establish the diagnosis. Treatment includes early mechanical ventilation and surfactant administration.\nIn this neonate, the history of prematurity, the classic presentation, and the characteristic chest-x ray make\nHMD the most likely diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Transient tachypnea usually follows an uneventful normal term vaginal delivery or cesarean\ndelivery. It is characterized by the early onset of tachypnea, sometimes with retractions or expiratory\ngrunting, and typically, cyanosis that is relieved by minimal oxygen. The lungs are usually clear without rales\nor rhonchi, and the chest-x ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings, fluid lines in the fissures,\noveraeration, a flat diaphragm, and occasionally, pleural fluid. Hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis are\nuncommon. The distinguishing feature in this case is the x-ray finding.\n(Choice C) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) should be suspected in all term and\npost-term infants with cyanosis with or without fetal distress. Persistence of the fetal circulatory pattern of\nright-to-left shunting through the PDA and foramen ovale after birth is due to very high pulmonary vascular\nresistance. The associated hypoxia is universal and unresponsive to 100% oxygen. The chest-x ray may be\nnormal or may show parenchymal opacification in the chest, depending on the etiology. Although the clinical\npresentation of PPHN is indistinguishable from HMD, the x-ray findings of this case are very typical and\ntherefore very suggestive of the latter.\n(Choice D) Meconium aspiration syndrome usually occurs in term or post-term infants. Either in utero or\nmore often with the first breath, thick and particulate meconium is aspirated into the lungs, resulting in small\nairway obstruction and consequent respiratory distress that presents within the first hour of birth. Partial\nobstruction of some airways may lead to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Patchy infiltrates, coarse\nstreaking of both lung fields, increased anteroposterior diameter, and flattening of the diaphragm characterize\nthe typical chest-x ray.\n(Choice E) Intracranial hemorrhage in neonates classically presents as periods of apnea, pallor or cyanosis,\npoor suckling, abnormal eye signs, high-pitched, shrill cry, muscular twitching, convulsions, decreased\nmuscle tone or paralysis, metabolic acidosis, shock, and a decreased hematocrit. The fontanel may be\ntense and bulging. The condition is rarely present at birth and is diagnosed on the basis of the history, clinical\nmanifestations, and trans-fontanel cranial ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT).\nEducational Objective:\nHyaline membrane disease should be suspected in preterm infants with respiratory distress and hypoxia not\nresponding to oxygen therapy. The characteristic chest-x ray finding of HMD demonstrates fine reticular\ngranularity of the lung parenchyma, and treatment includes early mechanical ventilation and surfactant\nadministration."

    "question": "A 9-year-old girl is seen in the office for unsteady gait and weakness in the lower limbs. On examination she\nis found to have a wide-based gait with constant shifting of position to maintain her balance. There is\ndecreased vibratory and position sense in the lower extremities, and ankle jerks are absent bilaterally. Her\nfeet are deformed with high plantar arches. MRI of the brain and spinal cord shows marked atrophy of the\ncervical spinal cord and minimal cerebellar atrophy. Nerve conduction velocity results are within normal limits.\nEKG shows T-wave inversions in the inferior and lateral chest leads. The mother says that her other child, a\n3-year-old boy, is completely normal. He shares toys with his sister and plays well with other children at\nplayschool. He is able to copy squares and crosses but is unable to copy a triangle. Which of the following\nstatements would you advance while discussing the girl's condition with her mother?",
    "options": [
      "A. There is nothing to worry about since it's a non-progressive condition",
      "B. It is most likely a result of spontaneous mutation & the chances of your boy developing the same condition are minimal",
      "C. The EKG abnormalities are most likely due to myocardial ischaemia",
      "D. The inability of your boy to copy a triangle worries me since it may be an early manifestation of the same condition your daughter is suffering from",
      "E. I advise you to go for prenatal counseling if you desire any future pregnancies"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The physical findings and MRI features described in the question classically fit into the description of\nFriedreich Ataxia (FA). It is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by an excessive number of\ntrinucleotide repeat sequences, resulting in an abnormality of tocopherol transfer protein. The disorder is\nprogressive with poor prognosis (Choice A). Most patients are wheelchair bound by the age of 25 with death\noccurring by 30-35 years of age.\nFA is associated with necrosis and degeneration of cardiac muscle fibers leading to myocarditis, myocardial\nfibrosis and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure contribute to a significant\nnumber of deaths. T-wave inversion in this case is most likely due to myocarditis, and not myocardial\ninfarction (Choice C). [Remember the differential for T-wave inversion: myocardial infarction, myocarditis, old\npericarditis, myocardial contusion and digoxin toxicity].\nThe milestones of the 3-year-old boy are normal and ability to copy a triangle develops after the age of 5\nyears (Choice D). [3 years- copies a cross and circle, 4 years- copies a square and rectangle, 5 years-\ncopies a triangle, 6 years- copies a diamond]\nIn families with one affected child, the subsequent risk of another affected child is 25%, which is significant\n(Choice B). Genetic counseling is recommended for prenatal diagnosis for parents with one affected child\n(Choice E).\nEducational Objective:\nFriedreich Ataxia is an autosomal recessive condition and genetic counseling is recommended for prenatal\ndiagnosis for parents with one affected child."

    "question": "A 28-year-old Caucasian female comes to the office due to fever for the past 3 days. She also complains of\npain and swelling in her right breast for the past 4 days. She exclusively breastfeeds her 3-month-old baby.\nOn examination, she is febrile. Her right breast is engorged, red and tender, without any area of fluctuation.\nShe wants to know if she can continue to breastfeed. Which of the following is a contraindication to\nbreastfeeding?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mastitis",
      "B. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome",
      "C. Maternal rubella infection",
      "D. Breast milk jaundice",
      "E. Hemolytic disease of the newborn"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Although breastfeeding is generally encouraged due to its many advantages, physicians should always watch\nout for situations in which breastfeeding may do more harm than good. Some contraindications to\nbreastfeeding include certain active maternal infections (i.e., HIV, tuberculosis, herpes simplex lesions on or\nnear the nipple, malaria, sepsis, typhoid fever), eclampsia, nephritis, substance abuse, and breast cancer.\nTransmission of HIV by breastfeeding is well documented; therefore, the presence of maternal HIV infection is\nan absolute contraindication to breastfeeding.\n(Choice A) Mastitis is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Some physicians actually encourage\nbreastfeeding since this prevents engorgement, along with other subsequent symptoms such as fissures\nand cracking of the nipple. The woman in this case most likely has mastitis.\n(Choice C) Maternal rubella infection is not a contraindication to breastfeeding since there is currently\ninsufficient evidence regarding the associated risks.\n(Choice D) Breast milk jaundice is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Mothers of such infants are\ninstructed to switch their babies to formula-feeding for 1-2 days. This allows the increased indirect bilirubin\nlevels of the infant to return to normal values. After 2 days, the mother resumes breastfeeding, and further\nhyperbilirubinemia usually does not recur.\n(Choice E) Hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis) is not a contraindication to\nbreastfeeding because antibodies in the mother's milk are inactivated in the intestinal tract and do not\ncontribute to further hemolysis of the infant's RBCs.\nEducational Objective:\nTransmission of HIV by breastfeeding is well documented; therefore, the presence of maternal HIV infection is\nan absolute contraindication to breastfeeding."

    "question": "A female infant develops cyanosis. She was delivery vaginally at 43 weeks' gestation, and the amniotic fluid\nhad a greenish color. She has dry, peeling skin, emaciated extremities and long fingernails. Tachypnea,\nnasal flaring, and sub- and intercostal retractions are observed. Auscultation reveals rales and rhonchi. The\nchest radiograph reveals flattening of the diaphragm, hyperinflation of the lungs, and patchy opacities diffusely\ndistributed over both lung fields. Arterial blood gases reveal hypoxia and hypercarbia. What is most likely\nimpairing the normal respiratory function of this newborn?",
    "options": [
      "A. Fetal lung fluid",
      "B. Poor alveolar compliance",
      "C. Meconium",
      "D. Paralysis of the diaphragm"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient's history and physical findings are suggestive of meconium aspiration. The greenish amniotic\nfluid indicates the presence of meconium. The condition is more common in post-mature and\nsmall-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. The characteristic presentation includes signs of respiratory\ndistress (i.e., marked tachypnea and cyanosis at birth), rales, rhonchi, nasal flaring, grunting, and use of\naccessory muscles of respiration (e.g., subcostal and/or intercostal retractions). Hyperinflation occurs\nsecondarily to the valve-like mechanism by which meconium obstructs the airways, keeping air from exiting\nthe lungs after each inspiration. This state of hyperinflation consequently leads to a barrel-shaped chest\n(increased antero-posterior diameter). Hypoxia and acidosis also ensue, thus increasing pulmonary vascular\nresistance and aggravating the respiratory compromise. The typical chest radiograph of meconium\naspiration (as seen in this patient) includes flattening of the diaphragm, hyperinflation, coarse streaking\nand patchy opacities over both lung fields. Complications include pneumothorax, infection, pulmonary\nhypertension, residual lung problems and permanent neurological impairment due to asphyxia.\n(Choice A) Fetal lung fluid causes respiratory difficulty in transient tachypnea of the newborn. This condition\nis characterized by lack of clearance of fetal lung fluid and occurs most commonly in fetuses delivered\nby cesarean section. It is a self-limited condition that generally improves after a few hours. Auscultation\ndoes not show rales or rhonchi. The lungs are usually very clear. Patients usually do not require more than\n40% FiO2 to oxygenate adequately.\n(Choice B) Poor alveolar compliance is characteristic of respiratory distress syndrome. It is secondary to\nlack of pulmonary surfactant and occurs primarily in preterm infants. This patient is post-mature, based on\nthe gestational age, dry and peeling skin, emaciated extremities and long fingernails.\n(Choice D) The flattening of this patient's diaphragm is due to hyperinflation (not paralysis) of the lungs.\nFurthermore, the characteristic radiographic finding of diaphragmatic paralysis is an elevated\nhemi-diaphragm.\nEducational Objective:\nMeconium aspiration syndrome occurs most commonly in low birthweight and post-mature infants. It is\ncharacterized by respiratory distress at birth, rales, rhonchi, hyperinflation, and coarse streaking and patchy\nopacities on chest x-ray."

    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the office by his 27-year-old white mother for the evaluation of recurrent bone\nfractures. His first fracture was that of the femur, and occured when he was 6 months old. He had a fracture\nof the wrist 4 months ago. His mother also has a history of multiple fractures since childhood. She lost all\nher teeth at a very early age and is complaining of deafness. Her husband has a history of severe alcohol\nabuse. On examination, both mother and son have blue sclerae. What is the most likely involved disease\nprocess?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mutations in type 1 collagen",
      "B. Mutations in fibrillin-1 gene",
      "C. Child abuse",
      "D. Vitamin-D deficiency",
      "E. Congenital syphilis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The above child is most likely suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta, which is an inherited connective tissue\ndisorder caused by a mutation in the genes coding for type I collagen. Since type I collagen is an important\nstructural protein that is present in the skin, sclera, bone, tendon and ligament, patients with this disorder\npresent with multiple recurrent fractures, blue sclera, hearing loss, joint laxity, short stature, and scoliosis.\n(Choice B) Marfan syndrome is one of the most common connective tissue disorders, and is caused by\nmutation of the fibrillin-1 gene. Its mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant. The common features of this\ndisorder include skeletal manifestations (e.g., arachnodactyly, hypermobility of joints), ectopia lentis, and\naortic root dilatation.\n(Choice C) Child abuse suspected in the presence of any of the following: retinal hemorrhages, burns,\nbruising, fractures or abrasions. This is a good differential diagnosis for the given case; however,\nthe features of this patient (e.g., fractures, blue sclerae, family history of fractures and hearing loss) are very\ntypical of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n(Choice D) Children with rickets have slow growth and skeletal deformities. Blue sclerae and hearing loss\nare not the features of rickets.\n(Choice E) Early manifestations of congenital syphilis include jaundice, rash, lymphadenopathy, rhinitis and\nhepatosplenomegaly. Late manifestations occur around two year of age; these include saber shins, keratitis,\nHutchinson's teeth, saddle-nose deformity and deafness. The above child has typical features of\nosteogenesis imperfecta, not congenital syphilis.\nEducational Objective:\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in type 1 collagen. Its typical features are blue sclera and\nrecurrent fractures.\n*Extremely high yield question for USMLE step-1 and step-2"

      "D. The child will likely develop an anxiety disorder during childhood.",
      "E. This condition usually resolves by four months of age."
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Infantile colic is defined as excessive crying in an otherwise healthy infant for more than three hours a day,\nmore than three days a week, and more than three weeks in a month. Colic usually presents within the first\nthree weeks of life and resolves spontaneously by four months of age. Most parents report that the crying\noccurs at the same time of day, typically in the early evening. The crying begins suddenly, and the child\ngenerally cannot be comforted. The cause of colic is not known. Some evidence suggests a digestive tract\norigin (eg, trapped gas) leading to abdominal pain. Because the etiology of colic is not known, there is no\nuniversally accepted treatment. Proposed treatments include soothing measures, simethicone (which\ndecreases the surface tension of gas bubbles), or probiotics.\n(Choice A) Gastroesophageal reflux usually presents with excessive spitting up and crying related to\nfeedings. Medication is generally reserved for those infants not gaining weight appropriately.\n(Choice B) Changing to a lactose-free formula is not useful in infants with colic.\n(Choice C) Children with intussusception are usually 3-36 months in age. They have abdominal pain that\noccurs at different times of the day and bloody (\"currant jelly\") stools.\n(Choice D) There is no association between colic and anxiety disorders.\nEducational objective:\nColic presents by three weeks of age with excessive crying for more than three hours a day, more than three\ndays a week, and more than three weeks a month, usually resolving by four months of age."

His mother reports that he just recovered from prolonged diarrhea due to Giardia infection. His past\nmedical history is also significant for pneumonia and recurrent ear infections since 6 months of age. On\nphysical examination, his temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse is 140/min, and respirations are 40/min.\nExamination reveals a young child in mild respiratory distress and bronchial breath sounds in the right lower\nlung lobe. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his recurrent infections?",
    "options": [
      "A. Impaired oxidative metabolism",
      "B. Complement deficiency",
      "C. Thymic hypoplasia",
      "D. Adenosine deaminase deficiency",
      "E. Abnormal B-lymphocyte maturation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This infant has a history of Giardia and recurrent sinopulmonary infections since six months of age,\nsuggesting a genetic defect in B-lymphocyte maturation (Choice E). Genetic B-cell deficiencies present\nafter 6 months of age because this is when the newborn's levels of maternal antibodies drop. Affected\ninfants are predisposed to recurrent sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated organisms like H. influenzae\nand S. pneumoniae because immune destruction of encapsulated organisms depends upon the humoral\nimmune response. Deficiency in IgA, which inhabits the GI tract, is the specific deficiency that predisposes to\nGiardia infection.\n(Choice A) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a condition of impaired oxidative metabolism. In CGD,\na defect in the NADPH-oxidase system of phagocytic cells results in defective intracellular killing. Patients\nare therefore prone to abscesses secondary to catalase-producing organisms like Aspergillus and\nStaphylococcus.\n(Choice B) Gonococcal and meningococcal infections are common in patients with complement\ndeficiency. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae infections do occur in this patient population as well, but\ninfections with Giardia are not typically seen.\n(Choice C) Thymic hypoplasia is one element of DiGeorge syndrome. The resultant T-cell deficiency puts\npatients at high risk for viral and fungal infections.\n(Choice D) Adenosine deaminase deficiency is commonly the genetic defect underlying severe combined\nimmunodeficiency (SCID). Patients with SCID have a deficiency of both B- and T-cells. The T-cell deficiency\npredisposes to viral and fungal infections and the B-cell deficiency predisposes to infection by bacteria.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with genetic B-cell deficiencies begin to develop recurrent infections after passing 6 months of\nage. The deficient humoral immune response in these patients impairs the body's ability to destroy\nencapsulated organisms. Hence, recurrent sinopulmonary infections with H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae\nare common. Lack of IgA also predisposes to Giardia infection."

      "D. Epilepsy",
      "E. Neurofibromatosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The presentation of Sturge-Weber syndrome can include focal or generalized seizures, mental retardation,\nand a port wine stain or nevus flammeus along the territory of the trigeminal nerve, which represents a\ncongenital unilateral cavernous hemangioma. Seizures are the usual neurological presentation and may start\nat any age. Other pertinent findings are hemianopia, hemiparesis, hemisensory disturbance, and ipsilateral\nglaucoma. Skull x-rays, taken after the age of 2 years, reveal gyriform intracranial calcifications that\nresemble a tramline. Treatment is aimed at controlling the seizures and reducing intraocular\npressure. Argon laser therapy is successful in removing the skin lesions.\n(Choice B) The initial presentation in tuberous sclerosis is also a seizure, but the cutaneous abnormality is\ncalled adenoma sebaceum, which appears between 5-10 years of age.\n(Choice C) Capillary hemangioma usually presents at birth or appears by 6 months of age. It consists of\nsmall capillaries and presents as an irregular, raised lesion that blanches on pressure. Approximately 75%\nregress by age 7.\n(Choice D) Epilepsy is difficult to diagnose with just a single episode of seizures.\n(Choice E) The cutaneous lesions of neurofibromatosis are axillary freckling and café-au-lait spots.

      "C. Congenital chlamydial infection",
      "D. Congenital rubella infection",
      "E. Adenovirus infection"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This newborn most likely has conjunctival and pulmonary chlamydial infection. Chlamydia is usually\ntransmitted from the mother to the neonate during passage through the birth canal. Infected infants have a\n25% to 50% risk of developing conjunctivitis, and a 5% to 20% risk of developing pneumonia. Chlamydia is\nthe most common causative agent of infectious neonatal conjunctivitis. Chlamydial conjunctivitis develops a\nfew days to several weeks after birth, and manifests with conjunctival congestion, edema, and mucoid or\nfrank purulent discharge. Pneumonia usually appears 3 to 19 weeks after birth, and symptoms include\ncough, tachypnea, and rales; there is no fever, and wheezing is rare. (The latter two features permit to\ndifferentiate chlamydial pneumonia from RSV bronchiolitis.) The treatment is oral erythromycin for 14 days,\nas topical agents are ineffective.\nAside from an increased incidence of neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia, cervical carriage of\nChlamydia has been associated with a higher incidence of preterm labor, PROM, and late post-term\nendometritis. All these adverse outcomes and neonatal disease is best prevented by early detection and\ntreatment. Screening is thus recommended in high-risk individuals such as single mothers, adolescents,\npatients with low socioeconomic status, and promiscuous patients. Erythromycin is the drug of choice in\npregnancy and should be given to both the patient and her sexual partner. Another test should be performed\nlater in pregnancy, and a positive result warrants a second course of antibiotics.\n(Choice A) Gonococcal conjunctivitis is extremely purulent and presents between the 2nd and 5th day after\nbirth.\n(Choice B) Chemical conjunctivitis is secondary to the administration of prophylactic drops of silver\nnitrate. The conjunctivitis is mild and resolves within 24 hours without treatment.\n(Choice D) Ocular disease of congenital rubella syndrome is more serious and may include microphthalmia,\ncataract, glaucoma and retinopathy.\n(Choice E) The discharge in adenovirus conjunctivitis is also accompanied with respiratory symptoms but of\nthe upper respiratory tract. Moreover, the discharge is usually serous rather than mucoid or purulent, and is\nassociated with mild itching.\nEducational Objective:\nChlamydia is the most common causative agent of infectious neonatal conjunctivitis. Chlamydial pneumonia\ncan develop in infected infants."

Approximately 30% of cases are caused by viruses,\nespecially respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. Approximately 5% of cases are caused by other bacteria\n(e.g., Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The risk factors of\notitis media include age (6-36 months), low socioeconomic status, use of formula milk, caretaker smoking,\nrespiratory allergy, craniofacial anomalies, and chronic middle ear effusion.

    "explanation": "Thyroid dysgenesis (i.e, aplasia, hypoplasia, or an ectopic gland) is the most common cause of congenital\nhypothyroidism, accounting for 85% of cases in USA.\n(Choice B) A variety of defects in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone may result in congenital\nhypothyroidism, but this is not the commonest cause. Such conditions are characterized by a goiter (almost\nalways present) and an autosomal recessive mode of transmission.\n(Choice C) Defects in thyroid peroxidase can cause defective organification and coupling, leading to hypothyroidism, but this is less common than dysgenesis.\n(Choice D) Hypothyroidism has been reported as a result of inadvertent administration of radioiodine during\npregnancy for treatment of maternal Grave's disease or cancer of the thyroid, but it is not the most common\ncause of congenital hypothyroidism. In a woman of childbearing age, a pregnancy test must be performed\nbefore a therapeutic dose of 131I is given. 131I is also contraindicated in lactating mothers.\n(Choice E) Deficiency of TSH and hypothyroidism may occur in any of the conditions associated with\ndevelopmental defects of the pituitary or hypothalamus; however, thyroid dysgenesis is still the most\ncommon cause.\n(Choice F) Iodine deficiency or endemic goiter is the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism\nworldwide, but is essentially not seen in the United States.\nEducational Objective:\nThyroid dysgenesis is the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism in United States."

    "question": "A 2 and a half-year-old child is brought to the office for the evaluation of easy bruising, nosebleeds, and\ndecreased activity over the past week. He had an upper respiratory infection that was treated with an\nantibiotic 2 weeks ago. On examination, he is well-developed, seems well-nourished, anicteric, and pale.\nPertinent findings include some small palpable posterior cervical lymph nodes, sinus tachycardia, a grade I/VI\nsystolic ejection murmur, ecchymoses on his left shoulder and both lower extremities, and petechiae over his\nextremities and groin. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory findings are as follows:\nHemoglobin                 7.9 g/dL\nHematocrit                   24%\nPlatelet count               12,000/mm3\nWBC                         3,000/mm3\nReticulocyte count         0.5%\nA bone marrow biopsy reveal a markedly hypocellular marrow with decreased megakaryocytes and\nprecursors of the erythroid and myeloid cell lines. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acquired aplastic anemia",
      "B. Fanconi's anemia",
      "C. Diamond-Blackfan anemia",
      "D. Transient erythroblastopenia",
      "E. Acute myeloid leukemia"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Acquired aplastic anemia results from an injury to the bone marrow by radiation, drugs (chemotherapy or\nantibiotics such as chloramphenicol), insecticides, toxins (benzene, carbon tetrachloride), or\ninfections. Signs and symptoms include pallor, fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, easy bruising, petechiae,\nmucosal hemorrhage, and fever. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates a normocytic or macrocytic anemia,\nleukopenia, reticulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy is essential to make the\ndiagnosis; it typically shows profound hypocellularity with a decrease in all cell lines and fatty infiltration of the\nmarrow.\n(Choice B) Classically, patients with Fanconi's anemia have pancytopenia and characteristic congenital\nanomalies, such as hyperpigmentation on the trunk, neck and intertriginous areas and/or cafe-au-lait spots,\nshort stature, upper limb abnormalities, hypogonadism, skeletal anomalies, eye or eyelid changes, and renal\nmalformations. Blood counts start to decrease between 4 and 12 years of age, and the initial manifestation\nis usually thrombocytopenia, followed by neutropenia, then anemia.\n(Choice C) Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), or congenital pure red cell aplasia, presents in the first 3\nmonths of life with pallor and poor feeding. CBC reveals a normocytic or macrocytic anemia with\nreticulocytopenia. WBC and platelet counts are normal.\n(Choice D) Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) is an acquired red cell aplasia which occurs in\nhealthy children between 6 months and 5 years old. There is a gradual onset of symptoms such as pallor\nand decreased activity. The physical examination is unremarkable except for pallor and tachycardia. The\ntypical laboratory findings are normocytic normochromic anemia, with hemoglobin levels ranging from 3 to 8\ng/dL, and an extremely low reticulocyte count.\n(Choice E) Bone marrow infiltration due to leukemia results in pancytopenia by crowding out the normal bone\nmarrow elements. Patients present with lethargy (from anemia), bruising and bleeding (from\nthrombocytopenia), and unexplained fever. They may also complain of bone pain or present with a\nlimp. CBC shows pancytopenia or anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Acute myeloid leukemia is\nmore common in adults. In this case, the classic presentation after an upper respiratory infection, as well\nas the absence of other features of leukemia (normal bone marrow), makes acquired aplastic anemia the\nbest answer.\nEducational Objective:\nAplastic anemia should be suspected in any patient with pancytopenia following drug intake, exposure to\ntoxins or viral infections."

    "question": "A 6-year-old African-American boy is brought to the office by his mother due to a painful right knee, fever and\nchills over the last 2 days. The child was diagnosed with pharyngitis 2 weeks ago, and was treated with a\n10-day course of penicillin G. His temperature is 38.8C(102F) and pulse rate is 102/min. On examination,\nhis right knee joint is swollen and erythematous, with a decreased range of motion. The laboratory findings\nare significant for leukocytosis and an elevated ESR. X-rays of both the right hip and knee joints are normal.\nWhat is the most appropriate treatment for the patient's condition?",

      "A. Bed rest with the right knee joint in a position of comfort",
      "B. Repeat a ten-day course of penicillin G",
      "C. Bed rest & a ten-day course of penicillin G",
      "D. Bed rest & aspirin",
      "E. Right knee arthrocentesis & intravenous nafcillin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This child has features suggestive of septic arthritis. Septic arthritis can occur following skin or upper\nrespiratory tract infections. Arthrocentesis is both diagnostic and therapeutic, and is mandatory in all\nsuspected cases. Blood cultures and synovial fluid cultures must be obtained prior to administering the\nantibiotics. Empiric antibiotic therapy (IV nafcillin or IV cefazolin) should be started with pending synovial fluid\ncultures.\n(Choice A) Bed rest for 7 days with the knee joint in a position of comfort is the treatment for transient\nsynovitis, not septic arthritis.\n(Choices B and C) The patient has received an adequate course of penicillin for pharyngitis; therefore,\nrepeating the course is not required. Moreover, penicillin G is not the drug of choice for the empiric treatment\nof septic arthritis. The most common cause of septic arthritis in a native joint is Staphylococcus\naureus. Almost 99% of the staphylococcus strains are resistant to penicillin. The commonly used empirical\nantibiotics are nafcillin or cefazolin. Vancomycin should be used if the suspicion for methicillin resistant\nstaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is high.\n(Choice D) Aspirin is not usually used in children because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.\nEducational Objective:\nArthrocentesis followed by empiric treatment with intravenous nafcillin are the most appropriate measures for\nthe management of suspected septic arthritis in a child."

His past medical history\nis insignificant. Physical examination reveals right hemiparesis with little sensory abnormalities. No meningeal\nsigns are present. The motor function restored spontaneously during 24-hour observation in the hospital. A\nCT scan of the head is normal. What is the most probable cause of this patient's problem?",

      "J. Seizure",
      "K. Congenital heart disease",
      "L. Internal carotid artery dissection"
    ],
    "answer": "J",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is suggestive of Todd's paralysis as the cause of this patient's hemiparesis.\nSudden loss of consciousness with following disorientation and slow gain of consciousness is a\ncharacteristic description of a seizure, if the convulsive episode was missed. Postictal paralysis (Todd\nparalysis) may follow generalized as well as focal seizures. The exact pathophysiology of this condition is not\nwell understood, but most probably involves alteration in neuronal electrical activity. The motor deficit usually\nimproves rapidly with restoration of the function within 24 hours. Todd's paralysis usually indicates that a\nstructural abnormality underlying the seizure is present.\nRelation of the hemiparesis to the seizure-like episode and rapid reversibility of the motor deficit makes the\nother causes, like vascular thrombosis (Choices A, B, and C) or embolism (Choice K) unlikely.\nMigraine (Choice I) can produce reversible paralysis, but a history of headaches is typical.\nInternal carotid artery dissection (Choice L) is related to a specific trauma and usually manifests as a\npersistent neurologic defect.\nEducational Objective:\nTodd's paralysis represents a postictal condition that usually rapidly improves with restoration of motor\nfunction within 24 hours."

    "question": "A 6-year-old female with Down syndrome is brought to the physician for behavioral changes. Over the past\nfew weeks, she has begun refusing to do her usual activities. Her parents also report that she seems dizzy\nand state that she has developed urinary incontinence. On examination, she is hypotonic but hyperreflexic\nwith a positive Babinski reflex. Her gait is ataxic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alzheimer disease",
      "B. Atlantoaxial instability",
      "C. Hypothyroidism",
      "D. Mental retardation",
      "E. Spinal cord infarction"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Atlantoaxial instability is a malformation seen in 10-15% of patients with Down syndrome, and most\ncommonly occurs due to excessive laxity in the posterior transverse ligament, which causes increased\nmobility between the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2). Fortunately, only 1-2% of Down syndrome patients with\natlantoaxial instability are symptomatic. Symptoms usually progress over several weeks and result from\ncompression of the spinal cord. Presenting symptoms include behavioral changes, torticollis, urinary\nincontinence, and vertebrobasilar symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, and diplopia. On examination, upper\nmotor neuron symptoms such as leg spasticity, hyperreflexia, a positive Babinski sign, and clonus are often\npresent. Patients with Down syndrome are normally hypotonic, and they may remain hypotonic or have\nincreased tone with symptomatic atlantoaxial instability.\nAtlantoaxial instability is suspected on physical examination and diagnosed with lateral radiographs of the\ncervical spine in flexion, extension, and in a neutral position. Open mouth radiographs can also be helpful in\nvisualizing the odontoid. Treatment consists of surgical fusion of the first cervical vertebrae (C1) to the\nsecond (C2).\n(Choice A) Although there is a higher prevalence of Alzheimer disease among individuals with Down\nsyndrome, it usually presents around ages 40-50.\n(Choice C) The risk of hypothyroidism is increased in individuals with Down syndrome. These patients\npresent with decreased growth velocity, weight gain, cold intolerance, fatigue, constipation, or declining\nschool performance. Neurologic symptoms can include delayed reflexes, but upper motor neuron signs\nshould not be present.\n(Choice D) Mental retardation is seen in individuals with Down syndrome and can vary in its\nseverity. However, progressive neurologic symptoms are not seen with mental retardation alone.\n(Choice E) Spinal cord infarction presents with the acute onset of severe pain, weakness, and\nparesthesias. This condition is rare and more commonly seen in adults, and there is no increased risk in\npatients with Down syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nAtlantoaxial instability should be suspected in any patient with Down syndrome who presents with upper\nmotor neuron findings."

    "question": "A 6-month-old Hispanic boy is brought to the office for a well-baby check-up and follow-up immunizations.\nHis mother denies any new complaints. Physical examination reveals lesions that do not fade into the\nsurrounding skin, shown in picture below.\n[Image showing Mongolian spot was referenced here but not provided in text]\nWhat is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Perform fundoscopy to rule out retinal hemorrhages",
      "B. Coagulation tests to rule out a coagulopathy",
      "C. Immediately report to the authorities for child abuse",
      "D. Do nothing, since it is likely that these lesions will disappear in the next few years",
      "E. Schedule for excisional therapy with laser"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This baby has a classic Mongolian spot, which is common among dark-skinned races. The cause is\nentrapment of the melanocytes in the dermis during their migration from the neural crest into the epidermis in\nfetal development. The lesion is a blue, bluish-gray, bluish-green or blue-black, flat skin marking that usually\nappears at birth. It is mostly located at the base of the spine, on the lower back, and on the buttocks,\nalthough it can also be seen in other parts of the body such as the shoulders, arms, wrists, legs, ankles or\nabdomen. The face, palms and soles are usually spared. The bluish discoloration usually fades after a few\nyears and almost always disappears within or after seven years. Most cases do not require any treatment.\n(Choices A and C) Retinal hemorrhages are common findings in child abuse. Multiple retinal hemorrhages\nthat differ in size and color support the suspicion of child abuse. A precipitating factor (stepfather/mother,\nfinancial issue) is usually present in the history. In addition, there may be bruises that usually have\nassociated swelling and tenderness. In this case, nothing in the history and physical findings is suggestive\nof child abuse; therefore, reporting to the authorities is not necessary.\n(Choice B) Even though bruises secondary to coagulation disorders are plausible, the characteristic location\nand size of this patient's lesions make coagulation tests unnecessary.\n(Choice E) Excisional therapy with laser is not necessary since Mongolian spots are usually self-limited\nlesions. It is usually indicated for giant cavernous hemangioma.\nEducational Objective:\nMongolian spots are most commonly found in dark-skinned populations, present at birth, and usually fade or\ndisappear in several years."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother because he is lethargic and not as active as the other\nkids on their block. He has difficulty walking and getting up, and he always appears tired. His mother thinks\nthat she has a relative with a disorder that causes weakness. On examination, the child is alert but quiet. His\ncalves appear hypertrophied. His reflexes are depressed. When he gets up from the floor, he uses his\nhands to climb on his legs to assume an upright position. What is the most likely diagnosis of this child?",
    "options": [

      "C. Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
      "D. Polio myelitis",
      "E. Fragile X syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This boy presents with proximal muscle weakness, pseudohypertrophied calf muscles, decreased\nreflexes, and a positive Gower's sign (uses hands to walk up the legs and assume an upright position). His\nfeatures are very characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Other features include obesity, mental\nretardation and cardiomyopathy. Dystrophin is usually absent. EMG shows myopathic pattern. Serum CK\nlevels are very high (4000-5000 IU). The diagnosis is confirmed by muscle biopsy and family pedigree\nanalysis. The current treatment is supportive, although gene therapy trials are underway. The prognosis is\npoor, with most patients wheelchair-bound by 12 years of age.\n(Choice A) Myasthenia gravis symptoms may fluctuate, and may be purely ocular or\ngeneralized. Symptoms may include diplopia, ptosis, and muscle fatigue with normal deep tendon\nreflexes. Ten to fifteen percent of patients have a thymoma; hence, a CT scan is done to check for a\nthymoma. The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive edrophonium test (temporary improvement after the\nadministration of edrophonium).\n(Choice B) Dermatomyositis has a gradual onset in adult life, and is more common in females. Skin\nchanges may precede or follow muscle findings. There may be a rash on the eyelids, nose, cheeks, trunk\nand extremities. There may be an associated vasculitis in 25% of cases. Muscle biopsy is diagnostic.\n(Choice D) Polio may be a subclinical or a mild abortive illness. The individual may have a non-specific\nfebrile illness. Some individuals may have flaccid paralysis, absent deep tendon reflexes and normal\nsensation. There is no hypertrophy of the muscles. Approximately 10-25% may recover for up to 6\nmonths. The illness is prevented by the polio vaccine, and is almost eradicated in the USA.\n(Choice E) Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder and is a major cause of mental retardation\nin males. The typical features include facial overgrowth and macroorchidism. Patients may also be\nhyperactive or autistic. Patients do not have any muscular deficits.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a child with proximal muscle weakness, positive Gower's sign,\ndepressed reflexes, and pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles. Dystrophin is usually absent. EMG shows\nmyopathic pattern. Serum CK levels are very high (4000-5000 IU). The diagnosis is confirmed by muscle\nbiopsy."

      "E. Transposition of great vessels",
      "F. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital disease in children less than 4 years of\nage. Patients often present with cyanotic spells. The classic tetrad includes (1) overriding aorta, (2) right\nventricular hypertrophy, (3) subpulmonary stenosis (single S2), and (4) ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n(pansystolic murmur). Because a large unrestrictive VSD is always present, the right ventricular pressure is\nthe same as the left ventricular and aortic pressures. Pulmonary artery pressure and flow are inversely\nproportional to the degree of subpulmonary obstruction. The degree of cyanosis correlates precisely with the\namount of obstruction.\n(Choices B and D) Patent ductus arteriosus and VSD are non-cyanotic congenital heart diseases.\n(Choice E) Transposition of the great vessels is a common cause of death within the 1st year of\nlife. Children with this condition develop cyanosis and tachypnea within the first few days of life.\n(Choice F) Hypoplastic left heart syndrome usually presents with heart failure in the first few weeks of life,\nand carries a grave prognosis.\nEducational Objective:\nTetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital disease in children less than 4 years of age,\npresents with cyanotic spells and pansystolic murmur on examination."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient most likely has Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is the most common muscular\ndystrophy. His manifestations (i.e. pseudohypertrophy of the calves and positive Gower's sign) are\ncharacteristic for the disease. Furthermore, the similar symptomatology in the maternal uncle points out an\nX-linked recessive transmission. Muscle biopsy can confirm the diagnosis in this patient,\nalthough performing genetic studies are currently the most appropriate way of confirming the diagnosis in\natypical cases.\n(Choice A) An elevated serum creatinine kinase level is probably the earliest manifestation of the disease.\nIncreased levels can be seen in newborns. Similarly, aldolase levels are elevated, however, these levels can\ndrop as more muscle gets replaced with fat and fibrosis. These tests are typically used for screening\npurposes, rather than confirmatory.\n(Choices B and D) In DMD, EMG demonstrates a characteristic myopathic pattern with normal nerve\nconduction velocities; however, it is not used to confirm the diagnosis.\nEducational Objective:\nSerum CK levels are used for screening the muscular dystrophies. Muscle biopsy can confirm the diagnosis\nin most cases. The gold standard is genetic studies, which is required in atypical cases."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Iron also accumulates in the mitochondria and tissue, thus impairing energy production and\nresulting in cellular damage and systemic toxicity. Hypotension then occurs due to the increased capillary\npermeability and venodilation. The resulting peripheral hypoperfusion and mitochondrial damage lead to\naccumulation of lactic and citric acid, and consequent metabolic acidosis. The other complications include\nliver necrosis, coagulopathy, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Long-term sequelae include gastric scarring\nand pyloric stenosis. Since iron is radio-opaque, the tablets can be seen in the stomach on abdominal x-ray.\nThe diagnasis is confirmed by measuring serum iron levels. The treatment depends on the severity of the\npoisoning. Ipecac syrup to induce emesis is used in asymptomatic patients with an intact gag reflex.\nIntravenous deferoxamine, an iron chelator, is used in moderate to severe cases of intoxication. Activated\ncharcoal is not effective, and gastric lavage is not recommended in young children.\n(Choice A) There are no known cases of riboflavin (vitamin B2) poisoning.\n(Choice B) Acute ingestion of vitamin A causes anorexia, bulging fontanelle (pseudotumar cerebri),\nhyperirritability and vomiting.\n(Choice C) Acute vitamin D ingestion causes anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, polyuria and\npolydipsia.\n(Choice D) Vitamin K may cause hyperbilirubinemia in premature infants.\n(Choice F) Acute lead poisoning presents as vomiting, ataxia, colicky abdominal pain, irritability, seizures,\nencephalopathy and cerebral edema.\n(Choice G) Dimercaprol is the antidote for lead poisoning, as well as poisoning from other heavy metals\n(e.g., gold, arsenic, mercury).\n(Choice H) Aspirin poisoning is characterized by lethargy, fever, hyperpnea, vomiting, tinnitus and metabolic\nacidosis. In addition, abdominal radiographs are usually unremarkable with this condition.\nEducational Objective:\nIron poisoning presents as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and\nmetabolic acidosis.

The condition usually manifests in the second or\nthird year af life as impaired adaptation to darkness (which may progress to night blindness), photophobia,\ndry scaly skin, dry conjunctiva (xerosis conjunctiva), dry cornea (xerosis cornea) and a wrinkled, cloudy\ncornea (keratomalacia). Bitot spats (dry, silver-gray plagues on the bulbar conjunctiva) and follicular\nhyperkeratosis of the shoulders, buttocks, and extensor surfaces are less common findings.\n(Choice B) Thiamine deficiency is associated with infantile and adult beriberi, as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff\nsyndrome in alcoholics. Manifestations of infantile beriberi appear between the ages of two and three months\nand include a fulminant cardiac syndrome with cardiomegaly, tachycardia, cyanosis, dyspnea, and vomiting.\nAdult beriberi is categorized as dry or wet. Dry beriberi describes a symmetrical peripheral neuropathy\naccompanied by sensory and motor impairments, especially of the distal extremities. Wet beriberi includes\nthis neuropathy in addition to cardiac involvement (eg, cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart\nfailure, peripheral edema, tachycardia).\n(Choice C) Riboflavin is an integral component of coenzymes that participate in multiple cellular metabolic\npathways (eg, energy producing respiration). This vitamin is present in many foods, including meats, fish,\neggs, dairy products, green vegetables, yeast, and enriched foods. Pure riboflavin deficiency is therefore\nunusual in industrialized nations, but the condition has been documented in regions of the world with severe\nfood shortages. In the United States, patients who present with riboflavin deficiencies are usually stricken\nwith anorexia nervosa, malabsorptive syndromes (eg, celiac sprue), or rare inborn defects in riboflavin\nsynthesis. Riboflavin deficiency is typically mild and nonspecific in presentation, but symptoms may include\nsore throat, hyperemic and edematous oropharyngeal mucous membranes, cheilitis, stomatitis, glossitis,\nnormocytic-normochromic anemia, seborrheic dermatitis, and photophobia.\n(Choice D) Ascorbic acid deficiency is characterized by impaired collagen synthesis and damaged\nconnective tissue. The more common symptoms include ecchymoses, petechiae, bleeding gums,\nhyperkeratosis, Sjogren’ s syndrome, arthralgias, and impaired wound healing. Systemic manifestations\ninclude weakness, malaise, joint swelling, arthralgias, edema, coiled hair, depression, neuropathy, and\nvasomotor instability. This condition may also present with dry skin and eyes due to hyperkeratosis and\nkeratoconjunctivitis sicca; however, the other features in this case are diagnostic for Vitamin A deficiency.\n(Choice E) Hypervitaminosis A is usually due to the ingestion of excessive doses of vitamin A for several\nweeks or months. Symptoms include anorexia, pruritus, lack of weight gain, increased irritability, limitation of\nmotion, tender swelling of the bones, alopecia, seborrheic cutaneous lesions, fissuring of the corners of the\nmouth, increased intracranial pressure, and hepatomegaly.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect vitamin A deficiency in a 2 or 3-year-old child with impaired adaptation to darkness, photophobia, dry\nscaly skin, xerosis conjunctiva, xerosis cornea, keratomalacia, Bitot spots and follicular hyperkeratosis of the\nshoulders, buttocks, and extensor surfaces."

    "question": "A 14-year-old boy comes to the office because he has been feeling a mass under his right nipple far the last\nthree weeks. The physical examination reveals clinical findings suggestive of right gynecomastia with very\nmild tenderness. The left breast and the rest of the physical exam is unremarkable. His testis is 2 cm in\nlength and has 3 mL volume. What is the mast appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Biopsy of breast mass",
      "B. Reassurance",
      "C. Karyotyping",
      "D. MRI brain",
      "E. Serum prolactin levels"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Gynecomastia is a benign proliferation of the glandular tissue of the male breast. (In contrast,\npseudogynecomastia is the presence of adipose tissue rather than glandular tissue.) Patients with\ngynecomastia present with a rubbery or firm mass extending concentrically from the nipple. Gynecomastia\ncan be physiological (neonatal, adolescent/pubertal and gynecomastia of aging) or pathological (secondary\nto drugs, endocrine disorders, tumors, etc.)\nPubertal gynecomastia is seen in approximately one-half of adolescent boys at an average age of 14 years. It\nis often asymmetric or transiently unilateral, frequently tender, and regresses within 6 - 18 months. As\nin women, breast growth in men is mediated by estrogen and results from a decrease in the ratio of active\nandrogen to estrogen. In males, estrogen is synthesized by the peripheral conversion of androgen to\nestrogen, thus the onset of gynecomastia in adolescents correlates with the increase in adrenal androgens at\nadrenarche. Furthermore, LH stimulation of androgen synthesis by the Leydig cell in early puberty may be\nassociated with transient elevations of plasma estradiol, resulting in a low ratio of patent androgen to\nestrogen prior to the completion of puberty. Adolescent gynecomastia is typically transient. Watchful waiting\nwith reevaluation is reasonable in most cases, especially in those without substantial pain or tenderness.\n(Choices A, D and E) Biopsy of the breast mass (to rule out carcinoma), serum prolactin level\nmeasurement (for prolactinoma), MRI of the brain (for pituitary tumors), testicular scan (for testicular\npathology) are all indicated in the workup of pathological gynecomastia. These are not needed to\nevaluate physiological adolescent gynecomastia.\n(Choice C) In prepubertal males the testicular size is normally 2 cm in length and 3 mL in volume. During\npuberty it may reach up to 25 mL in volume. In postpubertal males, Klinefelter syndrome should be\nsuspected if the volume of the testis is small (testis size <10 mL) and firm.\nEducational Objective:\nPubertal gynecomastia is seen in approximately one-half of adolescent boys, at an average age of 14 years.\nIt is often asymmetric or transiently unilateral, and frequently tender. In prepubertal males the testicular size\nis normally 2 cm in length and 3 mL in volume. The initial management involves reassurance and watchful\nwaiting/observation.\n*Extremely high yield question for USMLE!!"

    "question": "A school teacher calls you to report that his 7-year-old student had about 10 episodes of eye blinking and\ngabbling today, which lasted approximately 30 seconds each. The child sat in his chair and did not have any\npostictal confusion. The teacher noticed several similar episodes during the last month, as well as a decline\nin the child's school performance. What type of seizure does this child have?",
    "options": [
      "A. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures",
      "B. Atonic seizures",
      "C. Simple partial seizures",
      "D. Absence seizures",
      "E. Complex partial seizures"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This child experienced absence seizures, which is a type of generalized epileptic seizure of childhood with\nsudden, brief lapses of consciousness and no loss of postural control.\n(Choice A) A generalized tonic-clonic seizure is characterized by the absolute loss of postural control, biting\nof the tongue, tonic-clonic jerky movements and postictal confusion with bladder or bowel incontinence.\n(Choice B) Atonic seizures are characterized by the sudden loss of postural muscle tone lasting 1-2 sec.\n(Choice C) A simple-partial seizure causes either motor, sensory, autonomic or psychic symptoms without\nan alteration in consciousness.\n(Choice E) Complex-partial seizures are characterized by an aura, subsequent behavioral arrest, and\ninvoluntary automatism. Postictal confusion or aphasia may occur.\nEducational Objective:\nAbsence seizure is a generalized seizure of childhood that is characterized by sudden and brief lapses of\nconsciousness without loss of postural control. The typical presentation includes multiple 'daydreaming’\nepisodes and a decline in school performance."

    "question": "An infant is born at term to a 30-year-old Caucasian female. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, and the\nmother received adequate prenatal care. The infant is a male and has 1-minute Apgar score of 8 and\n5-minute Apgar score of 9. He fails to pass a stool in the first 24 hours of life. Radiographic evaluation reveals\nsmall bowel obstruction at the level of the ileum. You suspect that a single gene defect may be responsible\nfor this patient's condition. Which of the following mutation of this single gene is most likely to be present in\nthis patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Deletion",
      "B. Non-sense",
      "C. Missense",
      "D. Frame-shift",
      "E. Splice-site"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described (failure to pass a stool in the first 24 hours of life, ileal obstruction) is\nsuggestive of meconium ileus. Meconium ileus is virtually diagnostic for cystic fibrosis, an autosomal\nrecessive disorder. A mutation of a single gene localized on chromosome 7 is responsible for this disorder.\nThis gene encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which actually\nfunctions as a regulated chloride channel. Abnormal chloride and sodium transport across the membrane\nresults in increased viscosity of secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis and accounts for the major clinical\nmanifestations of the disease, including meconium ileus.\nAbout 600 mutations are described that affect CFTR gene. The most common mutation is a deletion of a\nthree base pair encoding for phenylalanine (DF508); it is believed that this mutation prevents CFTR from\ntrafficking to the correct cellular location. About 70% of patients with cystic fibrosis in the US have this\nmutation. Other mutations like non-sense (Choice B), frame-shift (Choice D), and splice-site (Choice E)\ncan result in complete absence of CFTR protein. Missense mutations (Choice C) may lead to the defective\nregulation or defective conduction through the channel.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most common mutation that leads to cystic fibrosis is a deletion of a three base pair encoding for\nphenylalanine (DF508) in the CFTR gene located on chromosome 7; it is believed that this mutation prevents\nCFTR protein from trafficking to the correct cellular location."

    "question": "A 22-year-old Caucasian female who has received no prenatal care experiences a stillbirth. This is her first\npregnancy. The baby has multiple fractures, blue sclerae and short, bent extremities. Her past medical\nhistory is significant for a seizure disorder. She has been taking phenytoin regularly and had no seizure\nepisodes during the pregnancy. She admits to eating poorly and occasionally drinking alcohol during the first\ntrimester. She lives with her boyfriend who abuses her physically. She recalls several episodes of abuse\nduring the pregnancy. Which of the following is most likely responsible for fetal abnormalities?",
    "options": [
      "A. Folic acid deficiency",
      "B. Collagen synthesis defect",
      "C. Prenatal abuse",
      "D. Phenytoin use",
      "E. Alcohol abuse"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The infant described exhibits findings classic for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type II, an autosomal dominant\ninherited disease caused by defects in the gene coding for type I collagen. Type I collagen is widely\ndistributed in the body; it is found in bones, tendons, fibrocartilage, skin, eyes and other structures. OI type II\nis the most severe form of the disease and is characterized by multiple intrauterine and perinatal fractures as\nwell as restrictive lung disease. It most commonly results in fetal or perinatal death. Characteristic findings\ninclude blue sclerae, multiple fractures causing limb deformity, and intrauterine growth retardation.\n(Choice A) Folic acid deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia, glossitis and other Gl disturbances, such as\ndiarrhea. In pregnancy, folate deficiency will also predispose to neural tube defects.\n(Choice C) Prenatal physical abuse predisposes to low birth weight, fetal injury including fractures, and\ninfanticide following delivery. Without a careful history and physical, OI may be misdiagnosed as prenatal or\nchild abuse. Blue sclera is not seen with child abuse.\n(Choice D) Phenytoin use during pregnancy is associated with craniofacial anomalies, fingernail hypoplasia,\ngrowth deficiency, developmental delay, cardiac defects and facial clefts. Blue sclera and fractures are not\nseen.\n(Choice E) Alcohol abuse during pregnancy may predispose to fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Findings\ninclude subtle craniofacial abnormalities poor prenatal growth, microcephaly, hypotonia and poor feeding. As\nchildren with FAS age, growth retardation and mild mental retardation are typically present.\nEducational objective:\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by mutations in type I collagen.\nPatients with the severe type II form of this disease typically expire in utero due to multiple intrauterine and/or\nperinatal fractures. Clinical findings include limb deformities, growth retardation, multiple fractures and blue\nsclerae."

    "question": "A 2-week-old male infant is brought to the office by his mother due to fever and vomiting for the past two\ndays. He appeared normal until two days ago. He is being breastfed. He was born at 32 weeks gestation\nand weighed 2.7kg (6lb) at birth. On examination, he is ill-looking, lethargic, and febrile. His abdomen is\ndistended, bowel sounds are absent, and stool is guaiac-positive. An abdominal x-ray demonstrates\npneumatosis intestinalis. What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Intestinal obstruction",
      "B. Malrotation",
      "C. Meconium ileus",
      "D. Necrotizing enterocolitis",
      "E. Intestinal perforation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) usually occurs in preterm infants in the first 2 weeks of life, but can\npresent as late as 3 months of age in very low birth weight infants. Manifestations usually develop after\nstarting enteric feedings. The first sign is abdominal distention with gastric retention. Fever and vomiting are\nfrequently associated findings, making it often difficult to distinguish from sepsis or intestinal infections. In\nthis case, the classic clinical presentation in a preterm low birth weight infant and characteristic abdominal\nx-ray finding of pneumatosis intestinalis makes NEC the most likely diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Intestinal obstruction presents with bile-stained vomiting, features of abdominal distension, and\nreduced or absent bowel sounds. Fever can be present. Although this condition can be clinically\nindistinguishable from NEC, the other clinical clues of this case (e.g., preterm birth, x-ray findings) paint\ntowards NEC.\n(Choice B) Malrotation with obstruction from the midgut volvulus should also be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of this case. Upright abdominal x-ray shows the distribution of air in the intestine and often aids in\nlocating the site of the obstruction. Malrotation may be identified by contrast studies. Pneumatosis\nintestinalis is not found in midgut volvulus.\n(Choice C) Meconium ileus can be clinically indistinguishable from other intestinal obstructions. A\npresumptive diagnosis can be based on a history of cystic fibrosis in a sibling, palpation of doughy or cordlike\nmasses of intestines throughout the abdominal wall, and x-ray findings of unevenly distended intestinal loops\nabove the obstruction.\n(Choice E) In severe forms of NEC, intestinal perforation is a possible complication; however, in this case,\nthe abdominal x-ray did not reveal pneumoperitoneum, making intestinal perforation unlikely.\nEducational Objective:\nNeonatal necrotizing enterocolitis should be suspected in any preterm or low birth weight infant with fever,\nvomiting, abdominal distension, and pneumatosis intestinalis."

    "question": "A 5-year-old Mexican female child is brought ta the office far the evaluation of a pruritic vulva for the past\nfifteen days. The pruritus is felt mostly during the night. Her 4-year-ald cousin wha visited them four weeks\nago has a similar complaint. On examination, there is no vaginal discharge, but the vulva is erythematous.\nThe rest of the physical examination is normal. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of\nthis patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Detain the child with the suspicion of sexual abuse",
      "B. Do a scotch tape test",
      "C. Do stool examination for parasites",
      "D. Do vaginal fluid gram stain",
      "E. Do wet mount of vaginal fluid"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Vulvovaginitis in a prepubertal child can be caused by infections, congenital abnormalities, trauma or\ndermatological conditions. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis is responsible for 25 to 75% of cases of vulvovaginitis in\nprepubertal girls due to the lack of labial development, unestrogenized thin mucosa, poor hygiene, bubble\nbaths, shampoos, obesity and certain choices of clothing. In this case, the child's history (i.e., contact with\nanother toddler with similar complaints, nocturnal symptoms) is very suggestive of a pinworm infection.\nPinworm infection is common in school-going children. It typically presents with nocturnal anal pruritus, but\ncan also present with vulvovaginitis in prepubertal females. All children with recurrent episodes of itching that\nis severe at night should be examined for pinworms (using the 'Scotch tape’ test) and treated empirically with\nmebendazole.\n(Choice C) Pinworm infection cannot be confirmed with stool examination.\n(Choices A) Sexually-transmitted diseases in children of this age group are mostly due to sexual abuse. The\nmost likely causative organisms are T. vaginalis, N. gonorrhea, Chlamydia, T. pallidum, HPV, etc.\nMost infections are characterized by more severe symptoms and vaginal discharge. The patient in this case\ndoes not have vaginal discharge or any other signs of sexual abuse, making this diagnosis unlikely.\n(Choice D and E) Gram stain or vaginal fluid wet mount would have been appropriate if this patient had\nvaginal discharge and STD due to sexual abuse.\nEducational Objective:\nAll children with recurrent episodes of nocturnal vulvar itching should be examined for pinworms and treated\nempirically with mebendazole."

    "question": "A healthy 7-year-old Caucasian boy is brought to the office by his mother because of fever and pain in the\near. He has had these symptoms for the past three days. He has no other medical problems. Family history\nis not significant. He takes no medication. His temperature is 38.3 C (101 F). Otoscopic examination\nreveals an ear discharge, and the tympanic membrane is immobile with insufflation. He has a boil just behind\nthe pinna of the involved ear. His WBC count is 12,000/cmm. He is diagnosed with otitis media. Which of\nthe following is most specific for the diagnosis of otitis media?",
    "options": [
      "A. Presence of ear discharge",
      "B. Presence of a septic focus (boil)",
      "C. Immobile tympanic membrane",
      "D. Elevated WBC count",
      "E. Presence of light reflex"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Acute otitis media is a clinical diagnosis. Children usually complain of earache, fever, decreased hearing,\nand associated URI symptoms. Presence of inflamed tympanic membrane and diminished movement of the\nmembrane with insufflation are the hallmarks of otitis media.\nOff all the choices mentioned, tympanic membrane mobility is the most sensitive indicator. Otitis media is\noften difficult to diagnose on visual examination only; hence, it is very important to pneumatically force air\nagainst the eardrum to see whether the tympanic membrane will move or not. If the pressure is increased\nbehind the tympanic membrane by pus or any fluid, it will not move, and the diagnosis is made. If it moves\nwith pressure, then the diagnosis is very unlikely.\n(Choices A, B, D and E) All other findings are nonspecific in diagnosing acute otitis media. Fever is not\nrequired to make the diagnosis of acute otitis media.\nEducational Objective:\nPresence of inflamed tympanic membrane and diminished movement of the membrane with insufflation are\nthe hallmarks of otitis media.

    "options": [
      "A. Intravenous nutrition",
      "B. Sterile wrapping of exposed bowel",
      "C. Immediate surgery",
      "D. Look for associated anomalies",
      "E. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Diagnosing congenital abdominal wall defects can be made antenatally with maternal serum-AFP\nmeasurements and ultrasonography. The two types of abdominal wall defects are described in the table below:\nGastroschisis Omphalocele\n1. Bowel protrudes through a defect on the right side of the umbilical cord. 1. Intra-abdominal contents protrude through the umbilical ring. The abdominal herniation usually includes small bowel and may include large bowel and liver.\n2. Bowel is not covered by a protective membrane. 2. Bowel is covered by an amnioperitoneal membrane.\n3. Bowel looks \"angry\" and matted. 3. Can be associated with other congenital abnormalities (e.g. heart, kidney).\n4. Not typically associated with any other abnormalities outside the GI tract.\nIn this case, the neonate's congenital abdominal wall defect is gastroschisis. If the diagnosis was made\nantenatally, management would begin with planned spontaneous vaginal delivery at a tertiary neonatal surgical\nunit. Caesarean section is performed only in the presence of the usual obstetric indications. After delivery, the\nnext step in management is to immediately wrap the exposed bowel with sterile saline dressings and cover with\nplastic wrap in order to prevent insensible heat and large fluid losses. The neonate is then maintained in a\nthermo-neutral environment.\n(Choices A and E) Further steps in the management of gastroschisis include inserting an orogastric tube (to\ndecompress the stomach), establishing peripheral intravenous access (to provide fluids), and administration of\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics.\n(Choice C) Definitive treatment is indeed surgical; however, surgery should be preceded by the above\nmeasures. Primary closure is successful in 70% of neonates, but if it is unsuccessful, staged closure with\nSilastic silo can be used.\n(Choice D) Looking for associated anomalies is not routinely required in gastroschisis. It is usually done in\npatients with omphalocele, which is commonly associated with other anomalies. Fetal chromosomal analysis\nby amniocentesis should be offered antenatally in such cases.\nThe management of omphalocele is similar to that of gastroschisis. Delivery is also planned at a tertiary care\ncenter, and caesarean section is reserved for the usual obstetric indications. (This is based on the lack of\nevidence that caesarean delivery improves the outcome of patients with uncomplicated omphalocele.)\nImmediate care of the newborn with omphalocele also involves sterile wrapping of the bowel (to preserve heat\nand minimize insensible fluid loss), insertion of an orogastric tube (to decompress the stomach), stabilizing the\nairway (to ensure adequate ventilation), and establishing peripheral intravenous access. Small defects (< 2\ncm) can be repaired with primary closure, but most defects will require a staged procedure with Silastic silo.\nEducational Objective:\nKnow how to differentiate between the different congenital abdominal wall defects. The first step in the\nmanagement of gastroschisis is to immediately wrap the exposed bowel in sterile saline dressing and plastic\nwrap in order to minimize heat and fluid losses."

      "C. Choanal atresia",
      "D. Transient tachypnea of the newborn",
      "E. Laryngomalacia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Suspect choanal atresia in an infant who presents with cyanosis that is aggravated by feeding and relieved by\ncrying. It is the most common nasal malformation. It may be isolated or part of a dysmorphic syndrome.\nThe severity of symptoms depends on the ability of the infant to breathe through the mouth, and whether one\nor both choanae are obstructed. Unilateral choanal atresia may remain undiagnosed until the infant develops\nhis first upper respiratory infection. Severe cases present with cyclic cyanosis; patients breathe through the\nmouth, and develop cyanosis that is aggravated by feeding and relieved by crying. Failure to pass a catheter\nthrough the nose 3-4 cm into the oropharynx is suggestive of the diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by\nCT scan with intranasal contrast, which shows a narrowing at the level of the pterygoid plate. The first step in\nmanagement consists of placing an oral airway and lavage feeding. Definitive treatment involves repairing\nthe obstruction with surgery or endoscopy.\n(Choice A) The cyanosis that occurs with cyanotic heart diseases have characteristic or distinguishing\nfeatures. In cyanotic heart diseases due to obstruction of pulmonary blood flow, the severity of symptoms\ndepends on the degree of obstruction. Patients with mild obstruction are asymptomatic at rest, and suddenly\nbecome cyanotic once exposed to stressful conditions. Such hypercyanotic crises are known as 'tet' spells,\nand are characteristic of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Tet spells may be confounded with the cyanosis noted in\nchoanal atresia; however, the cyanosis in choanal atresia is not triggered by stress, but by anything that will\nkeep the infant's mouth closed long enough (e.g., during feedings). Furthermore, patients with TOF will also\nhave a systolic ejection murmur of pulmonary stenosis and continuous murmur of VSD.\nThe other cyanotic heart diseases are due to abnormal ventricular-arterial connections, or total mixing of\nsystemic venous and pulmonary venous blood (e.g. transposition of the great arteries [TGA], total anomalous\npulmonary venous connection [TAPVC] and truncus arteriosus). In TGA, there may be no murmur on CVS\nexam, but the cyanosis is present at birth and is continuous. In TAPVC, there is always a right-to-left shunt at\nthe atrial level which presents with systolic ejection murmur in the pulmonic area. In truncus arteriosus, the\ncyanosis may initially be absent or moderate at birth, depending on the severity pulmonary outflow\nobstruction, and a murmur is always present.\n(Choice B) In left-to-right shunts, symptoms (e.g., tachypnea, chest retractions, nasal flaring and wheezing)\nappear due to an increase in pulmonary blood volume after the physiologic decline in pulmonary vascular\nresistance takes place during the first few weeks of life. Cyanosis appears after pulmonary hypertension\npressure becomes irreversible (Eisenmenger syndrome) and increases to such a degree that the shunt\nreverses from left-to-right to right-to-left.\n(Choice D) Transient tachypnea of the newborn is characterized by tachypnea that is not related to crying.\nAdditional symptoms include nasal flaring, subcostal/intercostal retractions and expiratory grunting. Cyanosis\nis typically noted, but the pattern of presentation during feeding and immediate relief with crying is not present.\n(Choice E) Laryngomalacia is the most common laryngeal congenital anomaly. The hallmark of the disease\nis inspiratory stridor that is exacerbated by any exertion. Symptoms appear within the first two weeks of life\nand gradually increase in severity. Cyanosis is usually not present.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect choanal atresia in an infant who presents with cyanosis that is aggravated by feeding and relieved by\ncrying.\n*Extremely high yield question for USMLE!!!"

      "E. Informed consent is not necessary because the mother is a minor"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "When planning to perform a procedure on a patient, informed consent must be obtained. Informed consent\nshould include an explanation of each of the following: the suspected diagnosis, the type of procedure or\ntreatment planned, the risks and possible complications of the procedure, and the alternative treatments\navailable. When a procedure needs to be performed on a minor, the minor's parent must provide informed\nconsent. In this particular case, the parent is a minor as well, which causes a dilemma because minors (<18\nyears old) are generally considered to be incapable of providing consent. However, most states have\nexceptions to this rule that allow the following groups of minors to provide consent: military personnel, those\nwho are married, pregnant minors, or those who are a parent, among others. In these instances, minors are\nconsidered emancipated from their parents.\nAlthough laws vary by state, most states have laws that consider a parent who is a minor to be equal to any\nother parent. Therefore, in this case the infant's mother should give consent for the lumbar puncture.\n(Choice B) Although the mother is a minor, her parents do not have to give consent for the infant's procedure\nbecause she is considered emancipated from them since she is a parent.\n(Choice C) One parent may consent to the treatment of a child as long as it is reasonable to assume that the\nother parent would not object.\n(Choice D) The mother does not need her parents to agree in order for her to give consent for the lumbar\npuncture to be performed on her child.\n(Choice E) Informed consent should always be obtained when possible. If the parents are not available to\nprovide consent, the physician may act in the patient's best interest and perform procedures that are\nconsidered emergent without consent. However, since the mother is available in this case, informed consent\nshould be obtained.\nEducational objective:\nA minor who is a parent can consent to treatments or procedures for his/her child."

    "options": [
      "A. Urinalysis",
      "B. Intravenous pyelogram",
      "C. Ultrasound of the kidneys",
      "D. Prescription of Imipramine",
      "E. Behavioral modification."
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In the management of enuresis, it is important to rule out any treatable causes such as urinary tract infection,\nbleeding, or a structural defect in the urinary tract. The initial evaluation should include a urinalysis since this\ntest is readily available and may provide valuable information.\n(Choice B) Intravenous pyelogram is usually not recommended as the first step in the management of\nenuresis. Although it can provide information about structural defects in the urinary tract, it is an invasive\nprocedure, and is indicated only if there is a history of reccurent urinary infections or the urinalysis shows\nevidence of bleeding.\n(Choice C) Ultrasonography is good in evaluating the kidneys and urinary tract in patients with renal failure.\nIt is not used in the initial evaluation of enuresis.\n(Choices D and E) If the abovementioned causes of enuresis have been ruled out, behavioral modifications\nare initially recommended. Examples of this intervention include making the patient urinate before bedtime,\nrestricting fluid intake before bedtime, and waking the patient in the middle of the night to urinate. Refractory\ncases may require the administration of drugs such as imipramine and desmopressin.\nEducational Objective:\nThe initial evaluation of enuresis includes a urinalysis to help rule out treatable causes such as infections,\nbleeding, or structural defects."

    "question": "A 1-month-old male infant is brought to the emergency department by his mother due to a 3-day history of\nprojectile vomiting. He has been formula-fed since birth, and his bowel movements are normal. He has\nnever been ill before. His parents and 4-year-old sister are all healthy. One of his maternal uncles is mentally\nretarded. He weighs 3.1kg(7lb). Physical examination reveals fair hair and skin, blue eyes, eczematous\nrash, and mild signs of dehydration. His urine has a mousy odor. What is the most appropriate screening\ntest for this patient's early diagnosis and treatment?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urine",
      "B. Serum TSH",
      "C. Blood level of alfa1-antiprotease",
      "D. Guthrie test in urine"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The clinical signs and family history of this patient are very suggestive of phenylketonuria, which is an\nautosomal recessive disorder. It occurs in approximately 1/10,000 births, and is more frequent in the\nCaucasian and Asian populations. The pathology involves a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase, the\nenzyme that breaks down phenylalanine into tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of\nphenylalanine and its metabolic products in the blood and body tissues (particularly in the brain). Untreated,\nthe defect can produce mental retardation and seizures. The most commonly used screening test is the\ndetermination of blood phenylalanine levels; however, Guthrie test, which is a qualitative (coloration) test, can\nalso be used as it detects the presence of metabolic products of phenylalanine in the urine. Treatment\nincludes a low-phenylalanine diet, since little amounts of phenylalanine are still necessary for growth and\ndevelopment. Cereals, starches, fruits, vegetables, and phenylalanine-free milk formulas are recommended.\nHigh-protein foods should be avoided. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis, with most\n(treated) patients having normal mental development and a normal life span.\n(Choice A) The screening of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the blood is used to diagnose\nporphyrias, which is a group of inherited disorders associated with neurological signs, photosensitivity and\nhyperpigmentation.\n(Choice B) Increased levels of TSH are found in myxedema (congenital hypothyroidism), which is\nassociated with mental retardation and a characteristic phenotype at birth.\n(Choice C) Children with congenital deficiency of alfa-1 proteinase usually present with respiratory and liver\nfailure signs.\nEducational Objective:\nGuthrie test is a qualitative (coloration) test which can detect the presence of metabolic products of\nphenylalanine in the urine."

    "question": "A male infant, born to a 32-year-old white female, develops a bluish discoloration of the extremities and oral\nmucous membranes at 30 minutes of life. On examination, the infant is found to have tachypnea, nasal\nflaring and respiratory grunting. Auscultation reveals poor air entry on the left with a shift of cardiac sounds\nto the right. The abdomen has a scaphoid shape. The antenatal history is significant for polyhydramnios in\nthe mother. The neonatologist on call suspects a diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. What is the\nmost appropriate next step in the management of this neonate?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chest X-ray (anteroposterior view)",
      "B. Cardiac ultrasonography",
      "C. Orogastric tube placement",
      "D. Bag-and-mask ventilation",
      "E. Chest tube placement"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The case scenario describes severe respiratory distress leading to central cyanosis in a neonate, and the\nmost likely diagnosis is congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). In all emergency situations such as this,\nremember that treatment takes precedence over diagnostic modalities. If the infant has a CDH, or if the\ndiagnosis is suspected in the delivery room, the first step is immediate placement of an orogastric tube and\nconnecting it to a continuous suction, in order to prevent bowel distension and further lung\ncompression. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are also priorities for all infants with severe\nCDH who present in the first hours of life.\n(Choices A and B) Placement of an orogastric tube prior to the chest x-ray helps determine the position of\nthe stomach. Typical chest x-ray findings in left-sided CDH include air or fluid-filled bowel loops in the left\nhemithorax, and shift of the cardiac silhouette to the right. CDH is sometimes associated with primary\npulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Continuous pulse oximetry is valuable in the diagnosis and\nmanagement of PPHN. If PPHN is present with right to left ductal shunting, then the PaO2 may be higher\nfrom a preductal (right-hand) sampling site. Cardiac ultrasonography can be performed to rule out congenital\nheart diseases.\n(Choice D) Bag-and-mask ventilation is to be avoided because this can cause the stomach and intestines\nto become distended with air, which can further compromise pulmonary function.\n(Choice E) Chest tube placement is necessary when a tension pneumothorax is present; however, the role\nof routine chest drainage is controversial.\nEducational Objective:\nThe first step in the management of an infant with suspected congenital diaphragmatic hernia is the\nplacement of an orogastric tube."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A young boy with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headaches, vomiting), bitemporal\nhemianapsia, and a calcified lesion above the sella has a craniopharyngioma until proven otherwise.\nCraniopharyngiomas are derived from epithelial remnants of Rathke's pouch. It is not a true pituitary tumor,\nand is characterized by nests of squamous cells in a loose stroma, resembling the appearance of embryonic\ntooth bud enamel. Its location is suprasellar and inferior to the optic chiasm, which is why it can cause\nbi-temporal hemianopia (by pressing the optic chiasm). Associated endocrine symptoms such as diabetes\ninsipidus (as in this patient), and growth failure associated with either hypothyroidism or growth hormone\ndeficiency may occur. The diagnosis is usually made by computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic\nresonance (MR) imaging. Presence of a cystic calcified parasellar lesion on MRI is almost diagnostic of\ncraniopharyngioma. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice.\n(Choice A) Patients with pituitary adenoma may present with similar symptoms; however, the condition\nis more frequent in women. Furthermore, prolactinoma is an important part of the syndrome, and\ncalcification of the gland does not occur.\n(Choice B) Meningiomas are non-invasive tumors derived from arachnoid cap cells, and consist of\nconcentric whorls and calcified psammoma bodies. These may indent the brain and cause hyperostosis.\nThese usually occur on the convex surfaces of the brain.\n(Choice C) In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica is often enlarged and contains no discernible pituitary\ngland. This syndrome may be primarily due to an incompetent sellar diaphragm with compression of the\npituitary gland by the herniating arachnoid, or secondary to surgery or radiotherapy.\n(Choice E) Ependymomas are gliomas and are benign. These do not cause bi-temporal hemianopia.\nEducational Objective:\nA young boy with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headaches, vomiting), bitemporal\nhemianapsia, and a calcified lesion above the sella has a craniopharyngioma until proven\notherwise.

    "explanation": "The baby in this clinical vignette has pyloric stenosis. The age (4 weeks old) and presentation (projectile\nnonbilious vomiting after feedings) are typical. A mass due to the hypertrophied pylorus can usually be\nperceived on palpation; however, in few cases, it may not be palpable. In such cases, ultrasonography will\nreveal the hypertrophied pylorus.\n(Choice A) Barium studies are not recommended as part of the first line investigation for the diagnosis.\n(Choice C) Substituting goat's milk will not be fruitful, as the child has been taking it since birth.\n(Choice E) The infant does have folic acid deficiency (macrocytosis) due to goat's milk, however, correcting\nit won't alleviate the symptoms.\n(Choice D) Dividing the feedings will not be helpful.\nEducational Objective:\nAlways suspect pyloric stenosis in a neonate who presents with non-bilious, projectile and persistent\nvomiting.

Joint aspiration reveals a turbid fluid with total WBC: 90 000/cmm and numerous\nbacteria. What is the most appropriate management in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Salicylates, rest and physical therapy.",
      "B. Intravenous antibiotics.",
      "C. Oral antibiotics.",
      "D. Emergency surgical drainage.",
      "E. Splint the hip joint and administer intravenous antibiotics."
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has a septic arthritis. Like osteomyelitis in a child, a septic joint is usually hematogenous in origin\nand frequently follows an upper respiratory tract infection. The most common organisms causing septic\narthritis in children are Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus. It is characterized by severe pain,\nleukocytosis and an elevated ESR. The typical patient generally refuses to walk, and keeps the affected\nlimb externally rotated (the external rotation position allows for maximal pus accumulation). Ultrasound\nguided aspiration of the synovial fluid should be performed immediately. The synovial fluid white cell count of\nmore than 100 000/ul indicates a definite septic arthritis. An x-ray is often normal. Empiric antibiotics based\non the gram stain results and child's age should be administered immediately. In infants a combination of\nnafcillin and third generation cephalosporin and for children over age 5 years nafcillin alone is a reasonable\nempiric antibiotic therapy. Septic joint in a child is a true surgical emergency and needs immediate drainage.\nA delay of even 4-6 hours can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\n(Choice A) Salicylates, rest and physical therapy are used to treat juvenile arthritis of the hip, which is\ncharacterized by joint narrowing on x-ray and an increased number of monocytes on joint fluid examination.\n(Choices B and E) Intravenous antibiotics are required along with surgical drainage. Antibiotics alone are\nnot helpful. Surgical drainage must be done as soon as possible and simultaneously intravenous antibiotics\nshould be administered.\n(Choice C) Oral antibiotics have no role in the initial management of septic arthritis. Intravenous antibiotics\nare mandatory.\nEducational Objective:\nSeptic joint in a child is a true surgical emergency and needs immediate surgical drainage. A delay of even\n4-6 hours can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head."

    "explanation": "Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a common vasculitic condition of childhood. It is commonly seen after an upper\nrespiratory tract infection and is more common in males. The classic findings are palpable purpura in the\nlower extremities and buttocks. There may be peripheral edema and scrotal swelling. Renal findings may\ninclude hematuria and proteinuria. The treatment includes administration of steroids and monitoring of renal\nfunction. When patients present with abdominal pain, the two common pathologies which should be ruled\nout emergently are Gl bleeding and intussusception. Intussusception is characterized by a sudden onset of\nabdominal pain with a large amount of blood in the stool. This is a surgical emergency, and is treated with\nair/barium enema.\n(Choice A) Appendicitis is no more common in Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) than in the normal child.\nAppendicitis is generally a clinical diagnosis with pain localized to the right lower quadrant. Ultrasound or CT\nscan may aid in the diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Cholecystitis is very rare in children. The only condition where cholecystitis may be more\ncommon in children is sickle cell anemia.\n(Choice C) Volvulus remains as a condition of the elderly. The transverse or sigmoid colon may be involved,\nand the diagnosis is made with a plain x-ray. It is a surgical emergency, and may be reduced with a\ncolonoscope.\n(Choice E) Diverticulitis is not common in children. It is a disorder seen mainly in the older age group, and a\nCT scan is diagnostic.

    "explanation": "This child most likely has Bordetella pertussis infection. He is now in the paroxysmal phase as indicated by\nhis bursts of whooping (loud inspiratory sound) cough. The flu-like symptoms he had earlier represent the\ncatarrhal phase, which is the initial stage of this infection. Presence of leukocytosis with predominant small\nand normal-appearing lymphocytes further supports the diagnosis. The recommended first line treatment for\npertussis is a macrolide antibiotic (erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin), regardless of the age or\nthe immunization status. Treatment is given whenever pertussis is suspected or confirmed, and regardless\nof the stage of the disease. It is of benefit because it shortens the evolution of the disease and clinical\nimprovement, and it limits the spread of the infection.

    "explanation": "Laryngomalacia or congenital flaccid larynx is the most common cause of chronic inspiratory noise in\ninfants. Inspiratory noises usually begin during the first 2 months of life. On examination, the baby is usually\nhappy. Vital signs and oxygen saturation is usually normal. The noise is purely inspiratory. The diagnosis of\nlaryngomalacia is confirmed by direct laryngoscopy; finding of an 'epiglottis rolling in from side to side’ is\ndiagnostic. The majority of children improve gradually, and in virtually all infants the symptoms disappear by\ntwo years of age. The mother should be instructed to hold the child in an upright position for half an hour after\nfeeding, and to never feed the child when he is lying down.\n(Choice B) Tracheostomy will only be required if there is severe respiratory compromise or cyanosis.\n(Choice C) Antibiotics have no role in the management of laryngomalacia.\n(Choice D) Laryngomalacia is a self-limiting condition in most cases, and generally subsides by 18 months\nof age.\n(Choice E) The noisy breathing (stridor) associated with laryngomalacia characteristically worsens when the\nchild cries and while lying in the supine position.

Additional features include prominent\neyes, prominent occiput, ear creases and hyperplasia of the pancreas. It is usually sporadic, but there are\noccasional cases involving familial inheritance. The exact cause is unknown, although it is sometimes\nassociated with duplication of chromosome 11p. This region contains the gene encoding for IGF-2, which\nmay explain the macrosomia. Sometimes, the hypoglycemia may be severe and intractable, and subtotal\npancreatectomy may be needed. Patients have an increased risk of neoplasms such as Wilms' tumor,\nhepatoblastoma, and gonadoblastoma.\n(Choice A) Congenital hypothyroidism also presents with hypotonia and an enlarged tongue, and may easily\nbe confused with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; however, an umbilical hernia (instead of omphalocele) is\nanother typical finding of hypothyroidism. Furthermore, the head circumference of patients with congenital\nhypothyroidism may be increased, whereas patients with Beckwith syndrome have microcephaly. There is\nno hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in patients with congenital hypothyroidism.\n(Choice B) Macrosomia secondary to maternal diabetes is an important differential diagnosis of\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; however, infants with this condition do not present with dysmorphic\nfeatures such as omphalocele, prominent occiput and macroglossia. Moreover, the prenatal and birth\nhistories of the patient in the case were unremarkable.\nThe common congenital problems that you should remember in an ‘infant of diabetic mother’ are:\n1.

Duodenal atresia and small left colon.\n4 Anencephaly and neural tube defects.\n(Choice D) WAGR syndrome is characterized by Wilms' tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomaly and mental\nretardation. It is related to a deletion in chromosome 11 involving the gene WT1 (Wilms' Tumor 1 gene) and\naniridia gene PAX6.\n(Choice E) Denys-Drash syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of Wilms' tumor, but its clinical\nfeatures are totally different from those of Beckwith syndrome. It includes male pseudohermaphrodism and\nearly onset renal failure characterized by mesangial sclerosis.\n(Choice F) The symptoms of galactosemia manifest a few days or weeks after the infant starts taking\nformula or breast milk. These include liver failure (hepatomegaly, direct hyperbilirubinemia, disorders of\ncoagulation), abnormal renal function, emesis, anorexia, acidosis and glycosuria.\n(Choice G) Von-Gierke disease is secondary to a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. It also affects the\nkidneys and liver, and causes severe hypoglycemia, however, the hypoglycemia characteristically occurs\nwith fasting, since it occurs secondarily to a failure to release glucose from the liver into the circulation, rather\nthan to hyperinsulinemia.\nEducational Objective:\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia, visceromegaly (liver and\nkidneys), omphalocele, hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.\n*You need to learn some syndromes, which are likely to appear on the exam.

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient has mild metatarsus adductus, which is a congenital foot deformity. Interestingly, the deformity is\nmost frequent in first-born infants; this is attributed to the molding effect of the primigravid uterus. There is no\nsexual predominance. Approximately 10% of patients also have an associated acetabular dysplasia;\nhence, careful hip examination is required. Metatarsus adductus is subdivided into three types. Type I\nmetatarsus adductus is characterized by feet that overcorrect both passively and actively into abduction.\nThese cases tend to spontaneously correct by themselves; therefore, treatment is not necessary.\n(Choices B and E) Type II metatarsus adductus is characterized by feet that correct to the neutral position\nwith passive and active movements; this is managed with orthosis or corrective shoes, and sometimes\nplaster casts if initial treatment gives no results. Type III metatarsus adductus is characterized by rigid feet\nand do not correct; these are managed with serial casts.\n(Choices C and D) Surgical treatment may be required if there is significant residual metatarsus adductus in\nchildren 4 years of age.\nEducational Objective:\nMild cases of metatarsus adductus correct spontaneously; therefore, treatment is not needed. Internal tibial\ntorsion is also a physiological finding in newborns, and spontaneous resolution occurs in more than 95% of\nthe children.\n*Know when to give reassurance!!"

      "O. Tetanus"
    ],
    "answer": "O",
    "explanation": "Tetanus is an infection of the nervous system, and is characterized by muscle spasms and hypertonicity.\nThe causative agent is Clostridium tetani, which produces a powerful toxin called tetanospasmin. Four\nclinical types of tetanus are recognized: generalized, localized, cephalic, and neonatal. The patient in this\ncase has neonatal tetanus.\nNeonatal tetanus is often generalized and invariably fatal, if left untreated. It is a significant problem in\ndeveloping countries. It is commonly seen in infants born to unimmunized mothers, frequently following\numbilical stump infection due to poor obstetric procedures, inadequate postnatal care, or cultural practices\n(i.e, application of cow dung or soil to the umbilical stump). The onset is generally within the first two weeks\nof birth, and is characterized by poor suckling and fatigue followed by rigidity, spasms and opisthotonus. The\nmortality is very high due to apnea (in the first week of life) and septicemia (in the second week) secondarily\nto the infection that originated at the umbilical stump. Preventive measures for neonatal tetanus include\nmaternal vaccination, promoting hospital delivery, training for non-medical birth attendants, and clean\ncord-handling practices.\nEducational Objective:\nNeonatal tetanus is generally seen in infants born to unimmunized mothers, frequently following umbilical\nstump infection. Affected infants initially present in the first two weeks of life with poor suckling and fatigue,\nfollowed by rigidity, spasms and opisthotonus."

    "question": "A one-month-old infant is born with craniofacial anomalies. Further evaluation reveals a cognitive\nimpairment, a 22q11 microdeletion in his chromosomes, and a heart condition with a right-to-left shunt. The\ninfant subsequently undergoes heart surgery. The surgeon notes that the patient's thymus is absent. The\nanesthesiologist observes prolonged QT intervals in the patient's ECG. What is the most important\nparameter that should be monitored throughout this surgery?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lymphocyte count",

      "C. Calcium levels",
      "D. Potassium levels",
      "E. Coagulation parameters"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "DiGeorge syndrome is an example of a contiguous gene syndrome in which neighboring genes on a\nchromosome are deleted. DiGeorge syndrome is specifically caused by the microdeletion of 22q11. Its\npresentation may vary with each newborn. Infants may have cyanotic heart disease, anomalies of the\ncraniofacial skeleton (low-set ears and micrognathia), absent thymus, absent parathyroid glands, recurrent\ninfections, or cognitive impairment. Absence of the parathyroid glands result in hypocalcemia; therefore, the\npatient's calcium levels must be monitored during surgery. Prolonged QT intervals may be caused by\nhypocalcemia. Severe calcium deficiency can lead to laryngeal spasm, convulsions, and cramping.\n(Choice A) Patients with DiGeorge syndrome have variably decreased lymphocyte counts. They are\nimmunodeficient and are prone to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. All infants should be immunized\nand provided with adequate antibiotic protection during surgery, however, the lymphocyte count is not the\nmost vital parameter to be measured at this time.\n(Choice B) Platelet counts are not altered in patients with DiGeorge syndrome.\n(Choice D) Potassium levels are important to monitor during open heart surgery since hyperkalemia (peaked\nT waves and widened QRS waves) may be fatal. however, hypocalcemia is the most likely and therefore the\nmost important adverse outcome to watch out for in patients with DiGeorge syndrome.\n(Choice E) Coagulation parameters are not affected by DiGeorge syndrome.\nEducational Objective:\nInfants with DiGeorge syndrome may have cyanotic heart disease, craniofacial anomalies, thymic hypoplasia,\ncognitive impairment and hypoparathyroidism. It is essential to monitor the calcium levels of these infants."

    "question": "An 8-month-old male infant is brought to the emergency department (ED) by his mother due to vomiting and a\ndecreased urine output. Three days ago, he had a fever, sore throat and ear pain. He was subsequently\ndiagnosed with otitis media and treated with oral amoxicillin. Today, in the ED, his temperature is\n40.0C(104F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 40/min and irregular, blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and\nweight is 8kgs (18 lbs). He is lethargic and arousable only to painful stimuli. His anterior fontanel is full and\ntense. His tympanic membranes are red and bulging. His pupils are reactive, but his eyes do not focus well\non his parents. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lumbar puncture",
      "B. Start intravenous amoxicillin",
      "C. CT scan of the brain",
      "D. MRI of the brain",
      "E. Start cefotaxime"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical presentation (i.e., very rapidly evolving febrile illness, changes in sensorium, and\nevidence of increased intracranial pressure) is very compatible with a central nervous system infection. He\nshould be empirically treated with a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone to\nprovide coverage for most of the agents responsible for meningitis, except for penicillin-resistant\npneumococcus, which requires the addition of vancomycin.\n(Choices A and C) The patient's decreased sensorium, bulging tense fontanel and Cushing's triad\n(decreased pulse rate, hypertension and irregular respirations) suggest an increase in ICP in addition to\nmeningitis. A CT scan or MRI of the head should be performed prior to a lumbar puncture to avoid the\npossibility of herniation; however, this should not delay antibiotic administration.\n(Choice B) When treating meningitis, the antibiotics must reliably penetrate the blood brain barrier and cover\nthe involved organisms. Although this patient's CNS infection is a likely complication of otitis media,\namoxicillin will not adequately cover the involved organisms; hence, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is the drug of\nchoice.\nEducational Objective:\nWhen a child presents with signs of increased intracranial pressure and meningitis, CT scan of the head\nshould be performed before performing a lumbar puncture to avoid the possibility of herniation; however, this\nshould not delay antibiotic administration."

    "options": [
      "A. Abdominal USG",
      "B. Intravenous pyelogram",
      "C. Urinalysis",
      "D. CT scan of abdomen",
      "E. Urine culture"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Urinalysis is a major non-invasive test that should be done first in all patients with renal manifestations. It is a\nfundamental test that is an indispensable part of clinical pathology. Renal diseases have various causes\nand presentations (e.g., symptoms related to the kidney or extrarenal site), and the urinalysis can give clues\nto the cause of renal impairment. In addition, estimation of the GFR and measurement of the serum levels of\nBUN and creatinine are used to assess the degree of renal impairment.\nA complete urinalysis includes both a chemical and microscopic analysis. It is best to examine the specimen\nwithin 30-60 minutes of voiding. In males, a midstream specimen is adequate. In females, cleaning of the\nexternal genitalia is required to avoid contamination with vaginal secretions. The standard urinalysis panel\nincludes: specimen appearance, pH, specific gravity, protein presence (urine dipstick and/or sulfosalicylic\nacid test), semi-quantitation, presence or absence of glucose and ketones, and microscopic examination of\nthe centrifuged urinary sediment. Urine dipstick for hematuria or pyuria is commonly used. Microscopic\nexamination of the urinary sediment may reveal cells, casts, bacteria, or crystals.\n(Choices A, B, D, and E) Abdominal ultrasonography, intravenous pyelogram, abdominal CT, and urine\nculture are all useful in the evaluation of renal disease; however, urinalysis should be performed first because\nit is non-invasive, readily available, and very helpful for the initial evaluation.\nEducational Objective:\nUrinalysis is a preliminary investigation that should be performed first in all patients with suspected renal\ndisease."

    "question": "A 7-day-old male infant is brought by his mother complaining of decreased movements of his right arm. She\ndenies any trauma or fall. Pregnancy was uneventful, but delivery was complicated with shoulder dystocia.\nExamination reveals the presence of crepitus and bony irregularity over the clavicular area and Moro reflex is\nabsent on the right. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Reassurance",
      "B. Figure-of-eight clavicle strap",
      "C. Passive and active motion exercises",
      "D. Nerve grafting",
      "E. Casting of the right arm and shoulder"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has a clavicle fracture as indicated by the irregularity and crepitus over the fracture\nsite. In infants, the clavicle is fractured most often during labor and delivery, and the right clavicle is twice as\nmuch affected as the left. This finding can simply be explained by the higher prevalence of the left anterior\noccipito-iliac variety of cephalic presentation, which, during external rotation, places the right (and not the left)\nclavicle under the pubic symphysis. Predisposing factors of clavicle fracture in neonates include large size,\nshoulder dystocia, and traumatic delivery. Patients are often asymptomatic or have minimal physical findings.\nGenerally, no specific treatment is required, and parents should only be advised to avoid applying any\ntension to the arm. The fracture heals within 3-6 weeks. Anatomic alignment is rarely achieved, which is not\nimportant in an infant, since any remaining callus will be evened out as the bone will grow.\nChoice B and E. Rarely, immobilization may be required using a figure-of-eight strap, but not arm and\nshoulder cast.\nChoice C. Any exercises should be avoided; and, on the contrary, no tension should be applied on the arm.\nChoice D. Nerve grafting is useful in nerve injuries. This patient has a clavicle fracture.\nEducational Objective:\n-Clavicular fracture presents with irregularity, crepitus, and fullness over the fracture site, and decreased\nmovements of the arm.\n-Predisposing factors are shoulder dystocia, traumatic delivery, and large size of the infant.\n-Generally, no specific treatment is required."

His vital signs are stable, except\nfor a temperature of 38.3C(101 F). He appears pale. On examination, the dorsal surface of his hands and\nfeet on both sides are swollen and tender, with restricted range of movement. He is an adopted child, and his\nfamily history is not available. Radiography of the feet and hands reveal soft tissue swelling. What is the\npathophysiology of this patient's presentation?",

      "B. Vaso-occlusive phenomena",
      "C. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy",
      "D. Staphylococcus osteomyelitis",
      "E. Autoimmune phenomena"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hand-foot syndrome or dactylitis is the earliest manifestation of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell anemia, thereby\nwarranting a complete workup for previously asymptomatic sickle cell patients. Patients usually present at\nthe age of 6 months to 2 years with an acute onset of pain and symmetric swelling of the hands and feet.\nAlthough only soft tissue swelling is initially seen, fever is sometimes present. The pathophysiology of\ndactylitis involves vascular necrosis of the metacarpals and metatarsals, which may be seen on plain\nradiographs as osteolytic lesions.\n(Choice A) Patients with sickle cell disease have poor splenic function, and are thus more prone to develop\nseptic joints and osteomyelitis. In such patients, osteomyelitis usually involves single bones (rather than\nbilateral hands and feet), and Salmonella is often isolated from bone cultures.\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a clinical syndrome comprised of clubbing of the toes and\nfingers, swollen joints and enlarged extremities. It may be primary or secondary. The primary form is very\nrare. The secondary form occurs in patients with pulmonary diseases, usually cancer. Lung cancer is very\nunlikely at this age group.\n(Choice D) Staphylococcal osteomyelitis presents with localized bone pain, soft tissue swelling and\nerythema. Sinus tracts with purulent drainage can sometimes be found on the skin surface. X-rays are\ninitially normal, but will later show (after approximately two to three weeks) periosteal elevation and necrotic\nareas. In sickle cell patients Salmonella often causes osteomyelitis.\n(Choice E) Sickle cell disease is not an autoimmune disorder. Its pathology involves a point mutation which\nresults in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid on the surface of the Hb S molecule in the sixth codon of\nthe beta globin chain.\nEducational Objective:\nDactylitis is the earliest manifestation of vaso-occlusive disease in sickle cell anemia."

What is the cardiovascular anomaly that is most likely to be\npresent in this child?",
    "options": [
      "A. Atrial septal defect",
      "B. Tetralogy of Fallot",
      "C. Coarctation of aorta",
      "D. Patent ductus arteriosus",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This child has the typical clinical presentation of Turner's syndrome: short stature, short webbed neck and\nbroad chest with widely spaced nipples. Other features include a low posterior hairline, gonadal dysgenesis,\ninfertility and primary amenorrhea, which may occur as the child grows. The associated cardiac anomaly in\nsuch patients is coarctation of the aorta (COA) and a bicuspid aortic valve. Physical findings of COA include\nupper extremity hypertension and a delay in the radial-femoral pulse. Congestive heart failure may be seen in\ninfants with severe cases. The diagnosis is made with an echocardiogram and the treatment is surgery.\n(Choice A) Atrial septal defect (ASD) is the second most common congenital cardiac lesion in adults (MC is\nbicuspid aortic valve). Ostium secundum type is the most common type. When compared with general\npopulation, incidence of ASD is not higher in patients with Turner's syndrome. ASD is usually detected\nincidentally in school children. It has a characteristic wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound. An\nechocardiogram is diagnostic. ASD does not usually close spontaneously and requires surgery.\n(Choice B) TOF is more commonly seen in patients with Down syndrome, and is a cyanotic heart condition.\nThe shunt is right to left, and the patient characteristically squats to relieve his symptoms. Squatting\nincreases the peripheral vascular resistance, which decreases the right to left shunt, thereby lessening the\ndegree of cyanosis.\n(Choice D) PDA is usually identified by a continuous machinery murmur in the upper chest. It may be\nasymptomatic or may present with congestive heart failure. The condition can be treated surgically or by\npercutaneous placement of coils in the PDA.\n(Choice E) VSD is the most common congenital heart defect. The shunt is left to right shunt. VSD may\neither be asymptomatic or may present with congestive heart failure. In asymptomatic infants, the lesion can\nbe observed as spontaneous closure can occur.\nEducational Objective:\nTurner syndrome is associated with a higher incidence of coarctation and bicuspid aortic valve. The clinical\npresentation includes short stature, short webbed neck, low posterior hairline, and broad chest with widely\nspaced nipples."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This child presents with recurrent upper respiratory tract infection, persistent nasal discharge, and bilateral\nnasal polyps. In a young child with the above symptoms, it is essential to rule out cystic fibrosis. Cystic\nfibrosis can present with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis and failure to thrive. A\npositive sweat test for sodium and chloride is diagnostic.\n(Choice A) Leukemic patients can present with numerous infections, diarrhea and failure to thrive, although\nsuch patients present with more serious bacterial and fungal infections. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly\nmay be found. Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Other findings may\ninclude hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, elevated LDH and hypokalemia.\n(Choice C) Foreign bodies are a common cause of stridor or bronchial asthma; however, the onset of\nrespiratory symptoms is usually rapid, and there may not be an elevated WBC. Chest x-ray bronchoscopy\nand endoscopy may be required for diagnosis. If the foreign body remains undetected, there may be a\npersistent pneumonia, atelectasis or pneumothorax.\n(Choice D) Nasal septal deviation may be developmental or traumatic. Individuals may present with\nunilateral nasal obstruction, facial pain, and anosmia, or they may be asymptomatic. For asymptomatic\nindividuals, no treatment is required. Nasal septal deviation does not lead to recurrent upper respiratory tract\ninfections.\n(Choice E) Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated hypersensitivity to foreign\nallergens. It may be acute or chronic, and can be confused with recurrent colds. It may present with itchy\neyes and tearing, swollen mucosa, headaches and nasal obstruction, if the age of onset is in the second\ndecade of life.

    "explanation": "Always think of epiglottitis first in a 3- to 7-year old child with acute respiratory distress, toxic appearance (i.e,\nsitting up, leaning forward, drooling), stridor and high-grade fever. Tachycardia and tachypnea are also\npresent. This is a pediatric emergency and should be managed emergently with endotracheal intubation;\nhowever, since intubation of such patients is difficult, preparation for possible tracheostomy is also standardly\nperformed. The complications of epiglottitis are serious, and include sudden airway obstruction.\nIn the pre vaccination era almost all the cases were due to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Because of\nthe routine infant vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccines, the antimicrobial spectrum has changed. H.\ninfluenzae type A and nontypable strains, H. parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus\naureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci are commonly isolated in Hib vaccinated patients.\n(Choice A) Airway management is the most important consideration in a patient with epiglottitis. Once the\nairway is secure, IV antibiotic therapy with either ceftriaxone or cefotaxime should be initiated. Starting\nantibiotics is not the first step in managing this patient.\n(Choice D) Nebulized racemic epinephrine is used in the management of croup.\n(Choice F) The three characteristic findings of epiglottitis in the lateral neck x-ray are: swollen epiglottis\n(thumb sign), thickened aryepiglottic folds, and obliteration of the vallecula; however, one should not wait\nfor x-ray results when the child has the above mentioned presentation. (The child could die from acute\nairway obstruction while he is getting the x-ray!)\nEducational Objective:\nEpiglottitis is a pediatric emergency. Secure the airway as soon as possible with endotracheal intubation and\nset-up for possible tracheostomy. Visualization of the epiglottis should not be attempted."

    "explanation": "Female infants less than 3 months of age sometimes develop vaginal spotting or bleeding. Maternal\nestrogens can cross the placenta and enter the fetal blood stream before birth, thereby causing a pubertal\neffect in the newborn which disappears as soon as the hormone is cleared from the infant's circulation.\n(Choice A) Chlamydial infection in the newborn occurs through transmission from the genital tract of infected\nmothers. Infected infants may present with pneumonia and conjunctivitis. Vaginal discharge is not a feature\nof chlamydial infection in the newborn.\n(Choice B) Most herpes infections in the newborn are caused by HSV-2. Infection occurs while the infant\npasses through the infected birth canal during delivery. This presents as a disseminated form of\ninfection, localized central nervous system disease or localized infection of the skin, eyes and mouth.\n(Choice C) Vaginal cancer usually occurs in women over the age of 50, with the exception of women who\nwere exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol. In this group of women, vaginal cancer occurs at an earlier age\n(i.e., under the age of 30), but still not in the neonatal period.\n(Choice E) Trichomonas infection is a sexually transmitted disease that is common in adolescents and in\nsexually active males and females.\n(Choice F) This child's discharge is physiological.

He has been breastfed since birth. His pulse rate is 122/min and blood pressure is 80/50mm Hg. He is\nirritable, his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is distended. Based on these findings, what is\nthe most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Pyloric stenosis",
      "B. Duodenal atresia",
      "C. Midgut volvulus",
      "D. Hirschsprung disease",
      "E. Meconium ileus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Midgut volvulus usually presents in a child less than one month old with bilious vomiting,\nabdominal distension and passage of bloodstained stools. Volvulus is associated with malrotation of the gut,\nand can be complicated by perforation and peritonitis.\n(Choice A) Pyloric stenosis is a common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. It usually\npresents in a 4-8 week old infant as non-bilious projectile vomiting which gradually becomes more frequent\nand forceful. Significant physical findings are a palpable abdominal mass and visible peristaltic waves in the\nupper abdomen.\n(Choice B) Duodenal atresia usually presents with bilious vomiting a few hours after the first feeding. It is\nusually associated with other congenital anomalies, and can be a feature of Down's syndrome.\n(Choice D) Hirschsprung's disease usually presents with failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours.\nIn this disease, an aganglionic segment of the colon causes the intestinal obstruction.\n(Choice E) Meconium ileus is a manifestation of cystic fibrosis, and usually presents with failure to pass\nmeconium within the first 24 hours after birth.\nEducational Objective:\nMidgut volvulus usually presents in a child less than one month of age as bilious vomiting, abdominal\ndistension and passage of bloodstained stools."

    "question": "A married couple brings their 2-week-old infant to the office for the evaluation of lethargy, poor feeding and\nhypotonia. The infant was \"fine\" until yesterday, when he started to present with these symptoms. The\nmother's medical history is unremarkable, and her pregnancy was uneventful. On examination, hypotonia,\npoor reflexes and bulging fontanel are noted. There are no focal neurological signs. He is hypotensive and\ntachycardiac. His temperature is 39.4 C (103F). Initial investigation reveals a WBC count of 16,000/cmm\nwith 18% bands. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Congenital toxoplasmosis",
      "B. Group B streptococcal meningitis",
      "C. Escherichia coli meningitis",
      "D. Herpes simplex encephalitis",
      "E. Listeria meningitis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Group B streptococcus is the most common cause of neonatal sepsis. It is part of the normal vaginal flora of\nwomen and is transmitted to infants during passage through the birth canal. In neonates, infection presents\neither as early-onset sepsis or late-onset sepsis. Early sepsis presents within the first week of life and\nusually involves several organs. Symptoms include respiratory failure, meningitis, DIC, acute tubular\nnecrosis and peripheral gangrene. It is usually refractory to therapy and quickly evolves to shock, coma and\ndeath.\nLate-onset GBS infection is usually a focal infection, most frequently meningitis (75%), although arthritis,\nosteomyelitis, cellulitis and urinary tract infection may also occur. Meningitis presents with fever, lethargy,\npoor feeding, hypotonia, seizures and a bulging fontanel. The diagnosis is confirmed by positive blood or\ncerebrospinal fluid cultures, although all newborns with fever and sepsis should have full workup for sepsis,\nincluding urine cultures. If the mother has already received antibiotics, culture results may be negative and a\nlatex agglutination test may be more helpful.\n(Choice A) Congenital toxoplasmosis classically presents with microcephaly, microphthalmia,\nhepatosplenomegaly and chorioretinitis. The infant in this case has meningitis with a septic picture.\n(Choice D) Herpes simplex virus encephalitis usually presents with focal neurologic signs, which are absent\nin this case. Herpes involves temporal lobes, so patients may present with seizures. Moreover, an elevated\nWBC count with bands correlate more with bacterial infections.\n(Choice C) Escherichia coli meningitis is less frequent than GBS meningitis. It is the second most common\ncause of neonatal meningitidis.\n(Choice E) Listeria is the third most common cause of neonatal meningitis. It also tends to result in multiple\nabscesses and pneumonia, in addition to meningitis.\nEducational Objective:\nGroup B streptococcus is the most common cause of neonatal sepsis. Early sepsis presents in the first\nweek of life and usually involves several organs. Late-onset GBS infection is usually a focal infection, and is\nmost frequently meningitis (75%)."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This child has an intussusception. She has the typical presentation: 2-year old child with abdominal pain of\nabrupt onset, nausea, vomiting, and red currant jelly stools containing blood and mucus. Intussusception is\none of the most frequent causes of intestinal obstruction in the first 2 years of life, with 75% of patients\nyounger than 1 year. The cause is mostly idiopathic, but in some cases, it is secondary to an intestinal mass\nsuch as polyp, lymphoma, hamartoma, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, enlarged Peyer's patches, or\nMeckel's diverticulum. The most common type of intussusception is ileocolic.\n(Choice A) Patients with pyloric stenosis present with non-bilious vomiting and an olive-shaped mass in the\nepigastrium. They don't have any blood or mucus in their stools.\n(Choice C) Henoch-Schonlein purpura presents as a rash around the buttocks, abdominal pain, arthritis and\nnephropathy.\n(Choice D) Meckel's diverticulum usually presents at 2 years of age as painless rectal bleeding.\n(Choice E) Some children with lymphoma may present with intussusception, but they are usually older\nthan children with the idiopathic form.\nEducational Objective:\nIntussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in the first two years of life. In addition to\nthe signs of intestinal obstruction (e.g., severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain and vomiting), patients present\nwith red currant jelly stools containing blood and mucus."

    "question": "A 3-year-old male infant is brought to the office by his parents because he is withdrawn, does not play and\nhas a deficiency in language skills, when compared to his peers. His antenatal history is insignificant, but he\npresented with severe hypotonia at birth. His family history is unremarkable. He eats \"too much\", which often\nobliges his parents to restrain him from eating. He is obese and has a peculiar dysmorphic facies consisting\nof narrow bifrontal diameter, almond-shaped eyes, a small, down-turned mouth, small hands and small feet.\nHis height is below the 5th percentile. Physical examination reveals hypotonia, microphallus, cryptorchidism,\nand delayed developmental milestones. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Prader-Willi syndrome",
      "B. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome",
      "C. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome",
      "D. Patau's syndrome",
      "E. Edward's syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which is a sporadic disorder. In 50-70 percent of cases,\nthere is a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 15. PWS displays a particular type of genetic\ntransmission called genomic imprinting, wherein the phenotype expression depends on whether the genetic\ndefect is inherited from the mother or the father. The characteristic clinical presentation is severe hypotonia\nat birth or infancy, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature and mental retardation. The typical craniofacial\nfeatures are narrow bifrontal diameter, diamond-shaped eyes and a small, down-turned mouth.\nHypothalamic dysfunctions (i.e., GH deficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) may be present. The\nassociated short stature, obesity and hypotonia usually respond to GH administration; however, the\nimplication of GH deficiency accompanying PWS in the development of these features is still controversial.\n(Choice B) Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by neonatal\nhypoglycemia, macroglossia, large size, visceromegaly, omphalocele and a characteristic earlobe crease.\n(Choice C) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine\nphosphoribosyl transferase, an enzyme involved in purine metabolism. It is characterized by self-mutilation,\nmental retardation, hyperuricemia and neurologic signs (e g., dystonia, choreoathetosis and cerebral palsy).\n(Choice D) Patau's syndrome, or trisomy 13, is characterized by scalp defects (cutis aplasia), cleft lip or\npalate, microcephaly, hypotelorism, flexed fingers with polydactyly and congenital heart defects. 90 to 95\npercent of babies with Patau's syndrome die before their first birthday.\n(Choice E) Edward's syndrome, or trisomy 18, is characterized by low birth weight, closed fists (with the\nindex finger overlapping the third finger, and the fifth finger overlapping the fourth), microcephaly, prominent\nocciput, rocker bottom feet and renal/cardiac malformations. Up to 95 percent of infants with trisomy 18 die\nwithin the first month of life. Only 5 percent survive to one year.\n*If you see a vignette with a child that is >=2-years-old, it is unlikely that the diagnosis is Patau's or Edward's\nsyndrome.\nEducational Objective:\nThe features of Prader-Willi syndrome (obesity hypogonadism syndrome) include hypotonia, hypogonadism\nand obesity. Remember mental retardation and the dysmorphic craniofacial features (i.e., narrow bifrontal\ndiameter, diamond-shaped eyes and a small, down-turned mouth).\n*Certain classic syndromes are important for USMLE exams. We will be giving only the syndromes which\nare likely to appear on the exam."

    "question": "A neonate born at term is found to have webbed neck and swollen hands and feet. Ultrasonogram of the\nabdomen shows a horseshoe kidney. Which of the following is the most likely cause of edema?",
    "options": [
      "A. Immune mediated red cell destruction",
      "B. Dysgenesis of the lymphatic network",
      "C. Decreased synthesis of albumin",
      "D. Increased urinary loss of protein",
      "E. Severe intrauterine hypoxia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has a webbed neck, which along with a high palate, a short fourth metacarpal, and nail dysplasia\nare common physical exam findings in newborns with Turner syndrome. Patients with Turner syndrome\nhave a higher risk of renal abnormalities, particularly horseshoe kidney, and should have a screening\nultrasound after the diagnosis is made. This patient's swollen hands and feet are likely due do congenital\nlymphedema, which is common in patients with Turner syndrome due to abnormal development of the\nlymphatic network. Edema that is due to lymphedema is generally nonpitting on physical exam as opposed\nto the pitting edema seen with CHF, liver failure, or nephrotic syndrome.\n(Choice A) Immune mediated red cell destruction is the pathophysiologic mechanism involved in hemolytic\ndisease of the newborn, where maternal antibodies to the Rh antigen attack the newborn's red blood\ncells. Infants with severe hemolytic anemia may have hydrops fetalis (generalized edema).\n(Choice C) Liver failure can cause pitting edema due to decreased synthesis of albumin, but is unlikely to be\npresent at birth and the other features in this patient are more suggestive of Turner syndrome.\n(Choice D) Increased urinary protein loss, as is seen in nephrotic syndrome, can lead to peripheral pitting\nedema. Again, it is uncommon at birth and the other clinical features in this patient point towards Turner\nsyndrome.\n(Choice E) Perinatal hypoxia has many detrimental effects to the brain, lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal\nsystems. However, peripheral edema is not generally one of the manifestations unless there is severe heart\nfailure.\nEducational objective:\nTurner syndrome should be considered in newborns with a webbed neck, high palate, short fourth\nmetacarpal, and nail dysplasia. Lymphedema frequently occurs due to abnormal development of the\nlymphatic system."

The\nheadaches are bifrontal, and are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and noise. It is her\nsecond episode, and both episodes were preceded by dark spots in her visual field. The first episode was 2\nweeks ago. She doesn't report any numbness or tingling in her extremities, and no behavioral change or\ndecline in school performance was noted. Her vital signs are stable and she is afebrile.

      "C. CT scan of the head",
      "D. MRI of the brain",
      "E. Electroencephalogram"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has migraine headaches with aura. Migraine headaches are the most common\ncause of headaches in the pediatric population, occurring in 50% of cases before the age of 20 years. The\naura can be visual (e.g. blurred vision, scotoma, photophobia, distortion of objects) or sensory (e.g, perioral\nparesthesia, numbness of extremities, shoulder pain, abdominal pain, otalgia). Migraine headache is a\nclinical diagnosis, and further investigations are not usually indicated. Neuroimaging is required only when\nthere are behavioral changes, decline in school performance, decline in growth parameters, early morning\nheadaches, seizures, or abnormal neurologic findings. In complicated migraines, neurologic signs (e.g,\nbasilar signs, ophthalmoplegia, or hemiparesis) may be present, although the work-up reveals nothing\nabnormal. These neurologic symptoms may last only during the headache or persist for several days or\nweeks.\n(Choice B) A lumbar puncture would be indicated if the patient had fever, neck stiffness or any other\nmeningeal signs.\n(Choices C, D and E) Neurological exam is normal, so neuroimaging studies and EEG are not indicated.\nEducational Objective:\nNo investigations are needed in the case of migraine headache, unless the neurological exam is abnormal\nand/or fever is present. Migraine is a clinical diagnosis, and the initial treatment is acetaminophen or NSAIDs."

    "options": [
      "A. Hemoglobin electrophoresis",
      "B. Colonoscopy",
      "C. Serum creatinine",
      "D. Oral iron therapy",
      "E. Blood transfusion"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in children. At birth, the iron stores of the infant are\ndependent upon the mother's iron stores, any prenatal or perinatal hemorrhage, and the gestational age of the\ninfant at delivery, with prematurity a risk factor for iron deficiency. Term infants usually have adequate iron\nstores to sustain them for the first six months of life. After six months, dietary factors (eg, insufficient intake,\nmalabsorption) become the most important cause of iron deficiency. Early introduction to or excessive intake\nof cow's milk is of particular concern because cow's milk is low in iron and can cause occult intestinal blood\nloss in infants. Children should not be started on cow's milk until one year of age, and children between one\nand five years old should not consume more than 20 ounces of milk a day.\nChildren with iron deficiency are often asymptomatic, with the diagnosis based on the complete blood\ncount. Important clues in the history and physical examination include predisposing factors such as poor\nnutrition and signs and symptoms such as pica, fatigue, and pallor. A peripheral smear demonstrates\nmicrocytic, hypochromic erythrocytes. Further testing is not necessary in children with the classic\npresentation. The most cost effective treatment approach is oral iron therapy. Repeat hemoglobin should be\nchecked in four weeks: If the hemoglobin level has risen 1 g/dL, then the oral iron therapy should be continued\nuntil the hemoglobin normalizes.\n(Choices A, B, and C) If the anemia does not resolve with empiric iron therapy and appropriate dietary\nchanges, other causes must be considered. Hemoglobin electrophoresis (for hereditary anemias),\ncolonoscopy (for lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding), or serum creatinine measurement (for renal disease)\nmay be indicated.\n(Choice E) Blood transfusions are rarely necessary in the treatment of dietary iron deficiency anemia, even\nwhen the hemoglobin is 4-5 g/dL. Iron therapy should be sufficient.\nEducational objective:\nIron deficiency anemia is common in infants and toddlers who drink excessive amounts of cow's\nmilk. Empiric oral iron therapy is appropriate for children with microcytic, hypochromic anemia."

The involved lesion is on the rostral midbrain\nat the level of the superior colliculus and CN III. It is most commonly caused by germinomas and pinealomas\nat this region. The endocrine syndrome results from interruption of hypothalamic inhibiting pathways, and\nsometimes beta-hCG secretion and consequent Leydig's cell stimulation.\n(Choice A) In 90% of cases, medulloblastoma arises from the cerebellar vermis, and is not associated with\nParinaud's syndrome.\n(Choice B) Neuroblastoma is the third most common malignancy in the pediatric population. It arises most\nfrequently from the adrenal glands and sympathetic paraspinal ganglia.\n(Choice C) Oligodendroglioma is a less common type of brain tumor in children.\n(Choice D) Although craniopharyngioma can also cause an endocrine syndrome, it results in visual field\ndefects owing to its sellar location.\nEducational Objective:\nParinaud's syndrome and Collier's sign usually indicate a lesion in the rostral midbrain, most likely pinealoma\nor germinoma."

      "A. Infant botulism",
      "B. Werdnig-Hoffmann syndrome",
      "C. Myotonic congenital myopathy",
      "D. Congenital hypothyroidism",
      "E. Myasthenia gravis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This clinical case is characteristic of congenital hypothyroidism, which may be familial or sporadic. The most\ncommon cause is thyroid dysgenesis (i.e, aplasia, hypoplasia, or ectopic gland), which has been\nincriminated in 85% of cases. Other causes include inborn errors of thyroxin synthesis (10%), and\ntransplacental maternal thyrotropin-receptor blocking antibodies (5%). Infants initially appear normal at birth,\nbut gradually develop apathy, weakness, hypotonia, large tongue, sluggish movement, abdominal bloating,\nand an umbilical hernia. Other signs include pathologic jaundice, difficult breathing, noisy respiration,\nhypothermia, and refractory macrocytic anemia. Infants initially appear normal due to the presence of\nmoderate amounts of maternal hormones in the infant's circulation. For this reason, screening is mandated\nin all states at birth to allow for the early detection, treatment, and consequent improvement of the prognosis.\nScreening is done by measuring serum T4 and TSH levels. The treatment is levothyroxine (initial dose of 10\nmg/kg, then titrated accordingly).\n(Choice A) Infant botulism occurs most commonly in infants whose diet includes honey or canned food.\nThis infant has been exclusively breastfed since birth. Furthermore, patients with botulism do not present\nwith a large tongue, umbilical hernia, and apathy, which are all classic features of hypothyroidism.\n(Choice B) Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that involves degeneration of the\nanterior horn cells and cranial nerve motor nuclei. It is a cause of \"floppy baby\" syndrome (the other cause is\ninfant botulism).\n(Choice C) Myotonic congenital myopathy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by muscle\nweakness and atrophy (most predominant in the distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities),\nmyotonia, testicular atrophy, and baldness.\n(Choice E) Myasthenia gravis presents with easy fatigability and weakness that improves with rest. The\npediatric form occurs in late childhood or adolescence.\nEducational Objective:\nInfants with congenital hypothyroidism initially appear normal at birth, but gradually develop apathy, weakness,\nhypotonia, large tongue, sluggish movement, abdominal bloating, and an umbilical hernia. For this reason,\nscreening newborns for hypothyroidism, along with phenylketonuria and galactosemia, is standardly\nperformed in all states."

A review of the maternal history reveals that she had poor prenatal care\nand the pregnancy was complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. On examination, the infant is\ndiaphaoretic and has a high-pitched cry. The infant is also noted to have occasional sneezing and is mildly\ntachypneic. No dysmorphic features are noted and the remainder of the examination is unremarkable. This\ninfant's symptoms are most likely caused by prenatal exposure to which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Valproic acid",

      "C. Alcohol",
      "D. Cocaine",
      "E. Heroin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Although most drugs of abuse cause an addiction in both the mother and the fetus, opiates have the most\ndramatic effects on the fetus. The opiates that infants are most commonly exposed to are heroin and\nmethadone. Methadone is prescribed for pregnant women who are addicted to heroin to prevent uncontrolled\nwithdrawal in the fetus. Heroin and methadone are not associated with dysmorphic features or congenital\nanomalies in the fetus, but prenatal exposure can lead to an increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation,\nmacrocephaly, sudden infant death syndrome, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).\nNAS usually presents in the first few days of life and is characterized by irritability, a high-pitched cry, poor\nsleeping, tremors, seizures, sweating, sneezing, tachypnea, poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nWithdrawal usually presents within 48 hours after birth for heroin withdrawal and between 48 and 72 hours for\nmethadone withdrawal, although it can be delayed up to four weeks. The treatment for NAS includes\nsymptomatic care to calm the infant and help the infant sleep, such as swaddling, providing small frequent\nfeeds, and keeping the infant in a low stimulation environment. Pharmacologic treatment should be used\nwhen supportive treatment does not control the infant's withdrawal symptoms. Morphine can be\nadministered and systematically weaned to help control opiate withdrawal.\n(Choice A) Fetal exposure to valproic acid significantly increases the risk of neural tube defects, may result\nin cardiac anomalies, and can produce dysmorphic facies, including a cleft lip, narrow bifrontal diameter,\nmidface hypoplasia, broad and depressed nasal bridge, and long philtrum.\n(Choice B) Prenatal exposure to phenytoin can result in fetal hydantoin syndrome, which is characterized by\nnail and digit hypoplasia, dysmorphic facies, and mental retardation. Growth deficiency can also be seen.\n(Choice C) Fetal alcohol syndrome consists of growth deficiency, presence of a long, smooth philtrum, small\npalpebral fissures, and a thin upper lip in addition to central nervous system abnormalities such as mental\nretardation. Withdrawal symptoms are usually not seen unless the mother was drinking just prior to delivery.\n(Choice D) Prenatal exposure to cocaine can result in jitteriness, excessive sucking, and a hyperactive Moro\nreflex. Withdrawal symptoms are usually not as severe as with opiates. Long-term effects on behavior,\nattention level, and intelligence may be seen.\nEducational objective:\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome is caused by infant withdrawal to opiates and usually presents in the first few\ndays of life. It is characterized by irritability, a high-pitched cry, poor sleeping, tremors, seizures, sweating,\nsneezing, tachypnea, poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhea."

    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. The\nmother says that he was \"fine\" a few days ago, and then suddenly became ill. Physical examination shows a\npale and jaundiced child. There is diffuse abdominal tenderness and 2+ pedal edema. Laboratory studies\nshow anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal insufficiency. What is the most likely cause of the patient's\nsymptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Vibrio cholera",
      "B. Escherichia coli",
      "C. Crohn's disease",
      "D. Lactose intolerance",
      "E. Salmonella poisoning",
      "F. Campylobacter jejuni"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is caused by a toxin released by Escherichia coli. The\nverotoxin invades and destroys the colonic epithelial lining, and produces a bloody diarrhea. Subsequent\nactivation of the coagulation system and red cell hemolysis results in jaundice. HUS is more common in\nchildren aged one- to four-years-old, and the initial presentation includes abdominal pain and diarrhea. The\nclassic triad of HUS is uremia, thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Investigations include CBC, platelet\ncount, blood smear, urinalysis, BUN and creatinine. Treatment is generally supportive, and involves\nplasmapheresis, dialysis if necessary, and steroids. Antibiotics are not indicated.\n(Choice A) Cholera usually presents during an epidemic with an abrupt, watery, painless diarrhea. There\nmay be vomiting, and most patients are severely dehydrated. The treatment is fluid replacement.\n(Choice C) Crohn's disease can affect any part of the Gl tract. It can present with fever, abdominal pain,\ndiarrhea (sometimes bloody), weight loss and rectal fissures. It generally has a gradual course, and is not\nseen in the very young. There is no hemolysis or jaundice.\n(Choice D) Lactose intolerance has features of chronic diarrhea (not bloody). It can present with abdominal\npain or cramps, and is usually associated with ingestion of dairy products. It is more common in Asians and\nAfricans. The diagnosis is suggested by: (1) improvement of symptoms after abstaining from dairy\nproducts, (2) acid pH of the stools, and (3) presence of positive reducing sugars. The diagnosis is confirmed\nby a positive hydrogen breath test.\n(Choice E) Salmonella poisoning is usually due to ingestion of contaminated water, food or milk. It can\npresent with general malaise, fever, and an erythematous rash on the abdomen (Rose spots). Most\nindividuals have diarrhea for several weeks. Stool cultures are diagnostic. If untreated, the disease can\nprogress to involve the brain, bone, kidney and joints.\n(Choice F) Even though Campylobacter jejuni can cause bloody diarrhea, it does not cause\nthrombocytopenia. Renal failure can be seen with any diarrhea secondary to dehydration and prerenal\nazotemia.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect hemolytic uremic syndrome in a child with sudden-onset abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and triad\nof anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure."

    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the office by his Caucasian mother because his speech is difficult to\nunderstand. He is a very slow learner, is unusually calm, stays to himself, doesn't hug his parents, prefers to\nplay by himself, speaks in mumbles, and repetitively tries to make towers with cubes. He becomes very\naggressive if he is stopped from his activities. He was born at term from an uncomplicated pregnancy and\ndelivery, and his physical growth has been normal. His brother used to be aggressive as a child, and was\ndiagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In the office, the patient is sitting quietly and trying to\nmake towers with cubes. He seems to be oblivious of his environment. On calling his name thrice, he turns\ntowards you once and then resumes playing with the cubes. What do you tell his mother?",
    "options": [
      "A. He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and would benefit from methylphenidate",
      "B. This could be autism and would benefit from antipsychotics",
      "C. He has hearing problems and he needs ear, nose and throat evaluation",
      "D. He has autism and will need special behavioral and educational programs",
      "E. His diagnosis is Asperger syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Autism, also called pervasive developmental disorder, is characterized by impairments in social\ninteraction and communication, stereotypical behaviors, and delayed language development. Lack of peer\nrelationship and nonverbal social cues, delayed social smile, repetitive activities and preference for\nsameness are also very commonly seen in these kids. Self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness when\nchanged from their routines have also been noticed. The mainstays of treatment include special education\nand behavioral modification techniques.\n(Choice A) The patient does not have any features of ADHD, such as impulsiveness, inattentiveness, or\nhyperactivity.\n(Choice B) No pharmacological agent has been found to be useful in autism; however, antipsychotics can be\nused in patients who are aggressive or have self-injurious behavior, but not as an initial measure.\n(Choice C) Deafness can easily be confused with autism, but in this case, the boy turned when his name\nwas called. Moreover, deaf children are usually affectionate and hug their parents, and their nonverbal social\ncues are normal. Even though deafness still has to be ruled out as part of this patient's evaluation,\nthe features of this patient make autism the most likely diagnosis.\n(Choice E) Asperger syndrome is another close differential diagnosis of autism, but these kids are usually\nmore socially aware and communicative. Although patients may have features of stereotypical movements\nand self-injurious behavior, their language development is normal. In this case, the patient's language\ndevelopment is delayed, hence autism is a better choice.\nEducational Objective:\nAlways think of autism first in any patient who is less than 3 years old and presents with impairment in social\ninteractions and communication, delayed language development, and stereotypical behaviors."

    "question": "A two-day old infant develops seizures, bulging fontanel, and focal neurologic signs. His temperature is 37 C\n(98F), pulse is 180/min, and capillary refill is >= 2 seconds. The initial work-up reveals a hemoglobin level of\n12g/dL. Transfontanel ultrasonography demonstrates a hemorrhage involving the germinal matrix, lateral\nventricles, and brain parenchyma. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this newborn's\ncondition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Prematurity",
      "B. Pelvic dystocia",
      "C. Prenatal infection",
      "D. Congenital anomaly",
      "E. Macrosomia"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This newborn most likely has a Grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which results from bleeding in the\ngerminal matrix, and occurs predominantly in premature and low-birth-weight (LBW) infants. Studies have\nshown that the incidence of IVH is inversely proportional to birth weight (the lower the birth weight, the greater\nthe likelihood of IVH). Exposure to vascular perfusion injuries have also been associated with IVH. Examples\nof such events are: (1) hypoxic or ischemic episodes, (2) hypotension, (3) reperfusion of damaged vessels,\n(4) increased venous pressure, and (4) abrupt changes in cerebral flow. Patients may present with pallor,\ncyanosis, hypotension, seizures, focal neurologic signs, bulging or tense fontanel, apnea and bradycardia;\nhowever, many cases remain asymptomatic, thus mandating transfontanel ultrasound for all newborns with\npredisposing risk factors. IVH is subdivided into 4 grades, according to the severity of the bleeding.\nLong-term sequelae include motor and intellectual disabilities, and are seen mainly in severe forms (grade 3\nand 4).\n(Choices B, C, D and E) Pelvic dystocia, prenatal infections, congenital anomalies, and macrosomia are not\ndirectly incriminated in IVH.\nEducational Objective:\nIVH is most commonly seen in premature and LBW infants. Patients may present with pallor, cyanosis,\nhypotension, seizures, focal neurologic signs, bulging or tense fontanel, apnea and bradycardia; however,\nmany cases remain asymptomatic, thus mandating transfontanel ultrasound for all newborns with\npredisposing risk factors."

Which of the following statements is true regarding this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. The primary amenorrhea in this girl is most likely caused by functional uterine abnormalities",
      "B. The girl should undergo bilateral abdominal gonadectomy",
      "C. The webbing of the neck is caused by defects in arteriovenous communications",
      "D. The inheritance for this condition is Mendelian dominant",
      "E. This child will benefit from steroid hormone replacement therapy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has Turner's syndrome, and although the usual karyotypic finding is 45, XO (i.e., 22 pairs of\nautosomes and a single X chromosome), variations are possible. The karyotype in this case (i.e. 46, XY) is\nassociated with a higher risk of gonadoblastoma; hence, prophylactic bilateral gonadectomy is indicated in\nthis patient.\n(Choice A) The primary amenorrhea seen in Turner's syndrome is due to ovarian failure, and not to uterine\nabnormalities.\n(Choice C) The webbing of the neck is due to lymphatic channel abnormalities, and not to arteriovenous\nmiscommunications.\n(Choice D) Turner's syndrome is inherited in a sporadic fashion, and not as an autosomal dominant trait.\n(Choice E) Patients with Turner's syndrome should be treated with growth hormones, not steroids, when\ntheir height falls below the 5th percentile on the normal growth curve. Therapy is continued until the bone age\nis greater than 15 years, and the growth rate falls to less than 2 cm.\nEducational Objective:\nTurner's syndrome with 46 XY karyotype is associated with a higher incidence of gonadoblastoma; hence,\nprophylactic bilateral gonadectomy is indicated in the management of such patients."

      "G. Vitamin B12 deficiency",
      "H. Pancytopenia",
      "I. G-6-PD deficiency"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Anemia of prematurity is seen in hospitalized, premature or low birth weight infants. The causes are usually\npathophysiologic, and include: (1) transitions in the erythropoiesis sites of the neonate, (2) shorter life span of\nred blood cells in neonates, and (3) diminished fetaplacental transfusion (occurs when the baby is held above\nthe level of the placenta after delivery). Symptoms include poor weight gain, poor feeding, lethargy,\ntachypnea, tachycardia, and pallor. The hemoglobin level is usually around 7-10 g/dL.\nAnemia of prematurity is defined by the following laboratory studies:\n1. Peripheral smear shows normocytic and normochromic anemia. No other abnormal forms are seen.\n2. The reticulocyte count is low, and red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow are decreased.\n3. Normal WBC and platelet counts.\n4. Normal total bilirubin level.\nThe treatment involves iron supplementation, periodic hemoglobin checking and blood transfusion, if needed.\nErythropoietin is not routinely used.\n(Choice A) Alpha thalassemia is caused by abnormalities in the synthesis of alpha chains of hemoglobin. It\nis usually a hypochromic, microcytic anemia, and a positive family history is usually present.\n(Choice B) Beta thalassemia is also a hypochromic, microcytic anemia that usually presents at 6-12 months\nof age.\n(Choice C) Hemolytic disease of the newborn is due to Rh or ABO incompatibility. The clinical features\ndepend on the severity of the disease. Symptoms include jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, pallor, and hydrops\nfetalis in severe cases. The reticulocyte count is increased due to hemolysis.\n(Choice D) Sickle cell anemia presents much later because the presence of hemoglobin F protects the\ninfants from sickling during the first 4-6 months of life. Dactylitis may be the initial presentation that warrants\nfurther work-up for sickle cell disease.\n(Choice F) Even though iron supplementation is routinely administered in the management of anemia of\nprematurity, iron deficiency is not the usual cause. Iron is given because it will be stored and reutilized during\nthe active phase of erythropoiesis.\n(Choice G) Low levels of folic acid or vitamin B12 do not cause anemia of prematurity. Furthermore, the\nanemia in such cases is megaloblastic.\nEducational Objective:\nAnemia of prematurity is the most common anemia in premature and low birth weigh infants. The pathology\ninvolves a combination of diminished RBC production, shortened RBC life span, and blood loss. Iron\nsupplementation does not prevent falling hemoglobin levels, and iron deficiency is not the cause of anemia of\nprematurity."

      "C. Sodium bicarbonate",
      "D. Phenytoin",
      "E. Observation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of severe tricyclic antidepressant intoxication. The\ncharacteristic features include seizure, hypotension, and prolonged QRS complexes on EKG. The first steps\nin the management of this pediatric emergency are the ABC's (airway, breathing, circulation). Patent airways\nand adequate breathing should be ascertained, and cardiac monitors, oximetry, and IV lines should be\nestablished. Sodium bicarbonate is given to correct the associated acidosis, and helps to narrow the QRS\ncomplex and to control hypotension.\n(Choice A) Physostigmine is used to correct the anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants during\nmild intoxication, but is never used in severe intoxication.\n(Choice B) Beta-blockers are avoided during tricyclic antidepressant intoxication.\n(Choice D) Prolonged seizures are treated with benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam). Phenytoin is usually not\nused, because it can increase the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias.\n(Choice E) In this situation, immediate actions should be undertaken to save the patient's life.\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment for tricyclic antidepressant intoxication includes sodium bicarbonate. This drug not only helps\nto correct the acidosis, but also helps to narrow the QRS complex prolongation. Benzodiazepine (eg,\ndiazepam) is given when the patient presents with seizures that require treatment.\n*Extremely high yield question for USMLE!!!"

    "question": "A 1-month-old infant is brought to the office for a routine neonatal visit. His prenatal and birth histories are\nunremarkable. His vital signs are normal. Examination reveals a harsh, loud holosystolic murmur over the\nleft, lower sternal border. Palpation reveals a thrill over the precordial region. There is no cyanosis, and\npulmonary auscultation reveals no rales. Chest radiograph reveals a heart of normal size and a slight\nincrease in pulmonary vascularity. EKG is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of\naction?",
    "options": [
      "A. PGE1 administration",
      "B. Oxygen administration",
      "C. Digoxin and diuretic therapy",
      "D. Surgical repair",
      "E. Reassurance"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's murmur (i.e., harsh and holosystolic heard at the left, lower sternal border) is characteristic of\nventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD accounts for 25% of all congenital heart diseases, making it the most\ncommon type. In this case, the defect is likely to be small, as suggested by the absence of symptoms (apart\nfrom the murmur), harsh and loud murmur, normal EKG and slight vascular markings on chest x-ray. In\nsmall VSDs, the volume of the left-to-right shunt remains small even after the postnatal decline in pulmonary\nresistance. The pulmonary circulation is thus protected, and symptoms which would otherwise appear due\nto the increased blood volume in the lungs, are absent. Small VSDs close spontaneously in 40% of cases\nby three years and in 75% by 10 years, so reassurance and surveillance are all that are needed. The risk of\ninfective endocarditis is increased in the long run; therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated prior to dental\nvisits and other oropharyngeal surgical procedures.\nIn large defects (soft murmur), the postnatal decrease in pulmonary resistance leads to an increase in blood\nflow through the shunt and a rise in pulmonary pressure. The resultant symptoms include chronic lower\nrespiratory infections, growth failure, and congestive heart failure. The constant, increased pressure involving\nthe pulmonary circulation results in irreversible vascular changes and consequent Eisenmenger syndrome\n(cyanosis, chest pain, dyspnea, and shortness of breath due to reversal of the shunt from left-to-right to\nright-to-left). The treatment depends on the size of the defect and severity of symptoms, but is generally a\ncombination of medication and surgery. Treatment should be initiated before pulmonary vascular changes\nbecome irreversible (Eisenmenger syndrome).\n(Choice A) PGE1 is a prostaglandin that is administered to keep the ductus arteriosus open in infants with:\n(1) lesions in which systemic blood flow or pulmonary blood flow is ductal dependant, and (2) mixing lesions\nwithout adequate mixing (d-TGA with intact ventricular septum).\n(Choices B and C) As long as there are no symptoms, there is no need to administer oxygen, diuretics, or\ndigoxin. These are indicated when symptoms of cardiac decompensation appear.\n(Choice D) Surgical repair is indicated in large or symptomatic defects.\nEducational Objective:\nMost small ventricular septal defects close spontaneously and require no treatment, as long as there are no\nsigns of pulmonary vascular disease. Reassurance, surveillance (via EKG and echocardiography), and\ninfective endocarditis prophylaxis are all that are needed for management."

Other physical findings are narrow hips with limited\nabduction, short sternum, cardiac and renal malformations, and mental retardation. Most patients\n(approximately 95%) die during their first year of life.\n(Choice A) Infants with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) usually present with hypotonia, flat face, upward and\nslanted palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, Brushfield spots, dysplasia of the pelvis, cardiac malformations,\nsimian crease, short and broad hands, hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the 5th finger, intestinal atresia,\nand high arched palate. Mental and growth retardation may later occur. Down's syndrome is the most\ncommon trisomy.\n(Choice C) Infants with Patau's syndrome (trisomy 13) can present with cleft lip, flexed fingers with\npolydactyly, ocular hypotelorism, bulbous nose, low-set malformed ears, small abnormal skull, cerebral\nmalformation, microphthalmia, cardiac malformations, scalp defects, hypoplastic or absent ribs, visceral and\ngenital anomalies. None of these are present in the above case.\n(Choice D) Wolf-Hirschhorn's syndrome is very low-yield for the USMLE. You do not need to remember this\ndisease. Nevertheless, the cause of this condition is a chromosome 4p deletion.

Other accompanying findings are microcephaly, dolichocephaly, hypoplasia of the eye sockets,\nbilateral epicanthic folds, cleft lip and palate, beaked nose with prominent bridge, cardiac malformations and\nmental retardation. Needless to say, none of these features are present in the above case.\n(Choice E) Infants with cri-du-chat syndrome may also present with microcephaly; however, there is a\ncharacteristic protruding metopic suture in such patients. Furthermore, the patient's cat-like cry will usually\nbe the tell-tale sign of this condition. Other accompanying manifestations are hypotonia, short\nstature, moonlike face, hypertelorism, bilateral epicanthic folds, high arched palate, wide and flat nasal bridge,\nand mental retardation. This condition is caused by a 5p deletion.\nEducational Objective:\nInfants with Edwards’ syndrome commonly present with microcephaly, prominent occiput, micrognathia,\nclosed fists with index finger overlapping the 3rd digit and the 5th digit overlapping the 4th, and rocker bottom\nfeet."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's short height, high arched palate, widely spaced nipples, and 45 XO karyotype are all consistent\nwith a diagnosis of Turner syndrome. Patients with Turner syndrome are prone to the development of\nosteoporosis which increases the risk of bone fracture. This increased risk is in part due to low estrogen\nlevels from gonadal dysgenesis. There is also thought to be increased risk from having only one copy of X\nchromosome genes that may be involved in bone metabolism. Estrogen replacement therapy is given to\nnearly all patients to promote normal maturation, but it also has the effect of reducing the risk of osteoporosis.\n(Choice B) The most common cardiovascular abnormalities in Turner syndrome are coarctation of the aorta\nand aortic valve abnormalities. Mitral valve prolapse is not very common.\n(Choice C) Most patients with Turner syndrome have normal cognitive abilities.\n(Choice D) There is no higher risk for development of bipolar disorder in patients with Turner syndrome.\n(Choice E) Patients with Turner syndrome do not have any additional risk of breast cancer. Turner\nsyndrome patients have decreased estrogen levels, while elevated estrogen levels are a risk factor for breast\ncancer.\nEducational objective:\nShort height, high arched palate, widely spaced nipples, and 45 XO karyotype are all features of Turner\nsyndrome.

    "explanation": "This case gives the classic description (i.e., well-demarcated, flat blue/gray lesion on the sacral or presacral\narea) of a Mongolian spot. This lesion is seen more commonly in dark skinned children. It is caused by\nentrapment of melanin-containing melanocytes in the dermis, and usually disappears in the first few years of\nlife.\n(Choice B) A bruise due to child abuse is possible, but is less likely than a Mongolian spot since a bruise\nusually fades into the surrounding skin and has different colors, which is not the case here.\n(Choice C) Cafe-au-lait spots are well-demarcated, tan or light brown flat lesions that can vary in number,\nsize, and distribution. This finding may indicate neurofibromatosis if the diameter is larger than 0.5 mm and if\nmore than 5 lesions are found.\n(Choice D) Cutis Marmorata appears as a lace-like pattern on the skin in response to cold or stress.

    "question": "A 5-year-old fair-skinned, blue-eyed girl is brought to the emergency department due to sudden-onset\nweakness on the left side of the body and slurred speech. She was playing with her toys just before the\nincident. There is no history of trauma to the head. Her medical history is unremarkable. She is tall for her\nage. The rest of her growth curve is below the 5th percentile. Her developmental milestones are delayed.\nShe has long, emaciated arms and legs, and arachnodactyly. Physical examination reveals brisk deep\ntendon reflexes, positive Babinski sign on the left side, hyperlaxity of the skin and joints, and mild scoliosis.\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency",
      "B. Cystathionine synthase deficiency",
      "C. Beta-galactosidase deficiency",
      "D. Marfan syndrome",
      "E. Tay Sach's disease",
      "F. Sickle cell disease",
      "G. Fabry's disease",
      "H. Arteriovenous malformation"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has homocystinuria, which is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from errors in\nmethionine metabolism secondary to cystathionine synthase deficiency. Her history is typical. She\nwas apparently normal at birth, and began to present with developmental delays thereafter. (Some infants\nmay present with failure to thrive.) More features appeared with time, such as skeletal abnormalities and\nosteoporosis. Although some of her features are characteristic of Marfan's syndrome (i.e, tall stature, long\nemaciated extremities, arachnodactyly, hyperlaxity of the skin and joints), her clinical presentation of a stroke\nis highly indicative of homocystinuria. (Remember: Marfan's features + thromboembolic events = classic\nhomocystinuria) Patients with homocystinuria may have thromboembolic events at any age, due to the\npathologic changes in the vessel walls and increased adhesiveness of the platelets. Such events most\ncommonly involve the cerebral vessels. Furthermore, another differentiating factor is the type of\nlens dislocation (ectopia lentis) that occurs with these diseases. In Marfan's syndrome, the lens is typically\ndislocated upward, and in homocystinuria, it is dislocated downward. Other eye complications of\nhomocystinuria are cataract formation and retinal detachment. As in phenylketonuria, patients usually have a\nfair complexion, but the musty odor is lacking.\nElevation of both homocysteine and methionine in body fluids confirm the diagnosis. The initial treatment is\nadministration of high doses of Vitamin B6. Restriction of methionine along with supplementation of cysteine\nis used for patients not responsive to Vitamin B6 therapy.\n(Choice A) Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism of phenylalanine, wherein phenylalanine\nhydroxylase is the deficient enzyme. This deficiency results in the build-up of phenylalanine and its\nmetabolites (phenyl ketones) in the blood and body fluids. Its clinical features include mental retardation, fair\ncomplexion, blue eyes, eczema and a musty body odor. Patients do not have a hypercoagulable state.\n(Choice C) Krabbe's disease is a sphingolipidosis due to a deficiency in beta-galactosidase, which results in\na total absence of myelin. Clinical features include mental retardation, blindness, deafness, paralysis,\nperipheral motor sensory neuropathy and seizures. Patients do not have a hypercoagulable state.\n(Choice D) The body habitus is characteristic of Marfan's syndrome, but the fair complexion and the\npresence of a thromboembolic accident point to homocystinuria. Remember that Marfan's patients do not\nhave mental retardation and thromboembolic events.\n(Choice E) Tay Sach's disease is another sphingolipidosis due to beta-hexosaminidase A\ndeficiency. Clinical findings include mental retardation, blindness, cherry-red macula, weakness, and\nseizures. Patients do not have a hypercoagulable state.\n(Choice F) Although sickle cell anemia may cause thromboembolic events, the clinical picture is very\nevocative of homocystinuria.\n(Choice G) Fabry's disease is also a sphingolipidosis that results from a deficiency of alpha-\ngalactosidase. The classic clinical features include angiokeratomas, peripheral neuropathy, and\nasymptomatic corneal dystrophy. Patients may develop kidney and heart failure, and thromboembolic events.\n(Choice H) An isolated AV malformation would not explain the whole clinical picture.\nEducational Objective:\nMarfan's features + mental retardation + thromboembolic events + downward dislocation of the lens =\nHomocystinuria. It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by cystathionine synthase\ndeficiency. Treatment mainly involves administration of high doses of Vit B6.\nKnow this!!"

    "question": "A 6-year-old female child is brought to the emergency department due to fever, chills and abdominal pain.\nShe has been complaining of burning micturition and abdominal pain for the last 2 days. Her temperature is\n102 F (38.9C), respirations are 20/min, pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. Physical\nexamination reveals costovertebral angle tenderness. Urine analysis shows pyuria, significant bacteriuria,\nWBC casts, positive nitrite, and esterase. What is the most likely cause of this condition in children?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hydronephrosis",
      "B. Wilm's tumor",
      "C. Vesicoureteral reflux",
      "D. Ureteral duplication",
      "E. Renal stones"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is defined as the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and renal\npelvis. Normally, the ureter is attached to the bladder in an oblique fashion, leading to a flap-valve\nmechanism that prevents reflux. When the submucosal portion of the ureter between the mucosa and\ndetrusor muscle is short or absent, reflux occurs. VUR is generally congenital, occurs in approximately 1%\nof children, and is more common in girls. It is a risk factor for UTI as it facilitates the transport of bacteria\nfrom bladder to the upper urinary tract; this explains why VUR is the most likely cause of acute UTI in\nchildren. VUR is present in 35-40 % of children with UTI. The diagnosis is made with voiding\ncystourethrogram (VCUG) followed by renal imaging.\n(Choice B) Wilm's tumor is generally seen in children, but is not a common cause of acute UTI.\n(Choice D) Ureteral duplication can lead to vesicoureteral reflux and acute UTI, but most of the vesicoureteral\nreflux are congenital, familial, and due to the anomalous intravesical portion of the ureter.\n(Choices A and E) Renal stones and hydronephrosis are not common in this age group.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute UTI in children is most commonly due to vesicoureteral reflux, which is mostly congenital and is seen\nin 1 % of newborns."

      "E. Forearm swelling is due to ischemia of the forearm soft tissues"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The clinical and x-ray findings suggest supracondylar fracture of the humerus causing Volkmann's ischemic\ncontracture.\n(Choice A) Because of collateral flow, a brachial artery injury may be present despite normal distal pulses.\n(Choice C) The condition is a type of compartment syndrome, and treatment should consist of immediate\ncompartment release fasciotomy to prevent further damage.\n(Choice D) There are not enough clues to suspect child abuse.\n(Choice B) Fractures of forearm bones may cause forearm swelling, but these will not demonstrate the\nanterior fat pad sign on x-rays.\nEducational Objective:\nDisplaced anterior fat pad is a radiographic sign of supracondylar fracture, which may be complicated by\nVolkmann's ischemic contracture."

      "C. Blood cultures",
      "D. Psychiatric evaluation",
      "E. Observation and reassurance"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Growing pains are common in children between the ages of two and twelve. The pain is usually poorly\nlocalized and common in the legs (usually below the knees and bilateral). It awakens the child at night and\nresponds to reassurance, massages or analgesics. In all cases, it resolves in the morning. The diagnosis of\ngrowing pain is a diagnosis of exclusion. All the physical and laboratory findings are negative. X-rays are not\nrequired if the physical exam is unremarkable. All such children are observed, and parents are assured that\nthis condition will resolve with time.\n(Choice A) X-rays are indicated if any pathology is suspected. When a diagnosis of growing pains is made\nand the physical exam is normal, x-rays are not warranted. The exam in these children is unremarkable and\nthere are no physical findings.\n(Choice B) Bone scans are never used in the diagnosis of growing pains. Bone scans are generally used in\nthe diagnosis of metastatic bone disease or osteomyelitis. The occasional child with a bone tumor may\npresent with such a scenario, but the pain is localized to one leg.\n(Choice C) Since the child has no obvious physical or laboratory findings, blood cultures are not\nindicated. For bone pathology, blood cultures have very low diagnostic yield.\n(Choice D) Psychiatric evaluation is not required for children with growing pains. All these children have\nnormal mental capacity and intellect.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect growing bone pain in a child with nocturnal pain and no obvious physical or laboratory finding.

He occasionally has severe paroxysms of cough that are\nprecipitated by eating and do not resolve with antitussive medications. On physical examination, extensive\nsubcutaneous emphysema over the anterior chest is noted. What is the most appropriate next step in the\nmanagement of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chest x-ray",

      "C. Ear examination",
      "D. CT scan of head",
      "E. Blood cultures"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Severe coughing paroxysms may result in subcutaneous emphysema, wherein air leaks from the chest wall\ninto the subcutaneous tissues due to the high intraalveolar pressure provoked by the cough. By a similar\nprocess, pneumothorax can occur; therefore, in such patients (i.e. those with apparent subcutaneous\nemphysema secondary to severe coughing paroxysms), chest x-rays must be obtained emergently to rule\nout pneumothorax.\n(Choice B) Cultures of the throat may be relevant in this case for diagnosis, but pneumothorax should still be\nruled out first.\n(Choice C) An ear infection could have caused this child's condition via oropharyngeal transmission, but this\ninformation is still not as important as the absence/presence of a pneumothorax.\n(Choice D) In this child, there is no reason for a CT scan of the head since there are no neurologic findings.\n(Choice E) Blood cultures are not warranted in this child.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Conduct disorder is characterized by disruptive behavioral patterns that violate basic social norms for at least\none year in patients less than 18 years old. It includes aggressive behavior towards others or animals,\nbehaviors resulting in property damage, theft, or violations of societal rules. The patient in this case has had\nall these typical symptoms for more than a year; hence, conduct disorder is the most likely diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Antisocial personality disorder would be the diagnosis if the patient were more than 18 years\nold. In conduct disorder, the outcome is most often antisocial personality disorder.\n(Choice C) Oppositional defiant disorder is also seen more commonly in late childhood and adolescence,\nbut is characterized by disruptive behavior such as negativity, hostility, and defiance.\n(Choice D) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually diagnosed before the patient is 7 years\nold and characterized by impulsivity, inattention and hyperactivity. Conduct disorder is a common outcome of\nADHD.\n(Choice E) Substance abuse is another very close differential diagnosis in an adolescent, but even though\nthe parents are suspicious, they have not seen him abusing drugs. At this point and based on the\ncharacteristic history, the patient is more likely to have conduct disorder, rather than substance abuse;\nhowever, it must be noted that conduct disorder is often associated with substance-related disorders and\nschool failures.\nEducational Objective:\nConduct disorder is characterized by disruptive behavioral patterns that violate basic social norms for at\nleast one year in patients less than 18 years old."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation and MRI findings of this patient are suggestive of a central nervous system (CNS)\ntumor. In the pediatric population, CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors and the second most\ncommon malignancies (after leukemias). Approximately 60% of these tumors are infratentorial, 25% are\nsupratentorial, and 15% arise in the midline. Astrocytomas are the most common histologic type for both\nsupratentorial and infratentorial groups.\n(Choice B) Medulloblastoma is the second most common tumor of the posterior fossa in\nchildren. Approximately 90% of cases arise from the vermis.\n(Choice C) Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant astrocytic tumor. It is unlikely in this case because\nit is usually seen in adults (elderly) patients.\n(Choice D) Pinealoma develops in the dorsal aspect of the midbrain. Symptoms consist of endocrine\nsyndrome, intracranial hypertension, Parinaud's sign (paralysis of vertical gaze), and Collier's sign (retraction\nof the eyelid).\n(Choice E) Craniopharyngiomas arise in the sella turcica, and symptoms usually include visual field defects\nand an endocrine syndrome.

There is no leg length discrepancy. A lateral radiograph of her\nhip is shown below. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n[Image showing SCFE radiograph was referenced here but not provided in text]\n",
    "options": [
      "A. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head",
      "B. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis",
      "C. Femoral neck stress fracture",
      "D. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease",
      "E. Chronic developmental hip dysplasia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a common hip disorder seen in adolescents. SCFE occurs\nwhen the capital femoral epiphysis displaces from the acetabulum. Boys are affected more often than girls,\nand the usual age of presentation is 10 to 16 years old. Obesity is a significant risk factor for the\ndevelopment of SCFE, and additional risk factors include endocrine issues such as hypothyroidism,\npanhypopituitarism, and growth hormone deficiency or supplementation. Children with endocrine issues in\nparticular are more likely to have bilateral disease and to present at an earlier age. Patients commonly\npresent with an insidious onset of knee or hip pain and a limp, usually without a history of\ntrauma. Sometimes, minor trauma can increase the pain and bring the patient to medical attention, similar to\nthis case. On examination, affected patients tend to hold the hip in passive external rotation and exhibit\ndecreased internal rotation, abduction, and flexion. Diagnosis is made with plain radiographs of the hip (AP\nand frog leg lateral views), which show the posteriorly and inferiorly displaced femoral head. Treatment\nconsists of emergent orthopedic consultation and surgical fixation at the current degree of slippage to avoid\nthe risk of avascular necrosis.\n(Choice A) Avascular necrosis of the femoral head can be a complication of SCFE because the displaced\nfemoral head can disrupt the blood supply. Avascular necrosis can also occur in Legg-Calve-Perthes\ndisease (Choice D), which is most commonly seen in younger children (ages 5-7) with idiopathic infarction\nof the femoral head.\n(Choice C) Femoral neck stress fractures occur most commonly in runners or other athletes doing\nextensive training. Patients typically present with a gradual increase in hip pain, especially with activity. They\nalso have pain with passive range of motion of the hip, especially internal and external rotation.\n(Choice E) Developmental hip dysplasia is caused by abnormal development of the hip in utero. It is usually\ndetected on the newborn physical exam, but can be diagnosed at a later age when a limp is noted. Leg\nlength discrepancy is present in developmental hip dysplasia and radiographs show a poorly formed femoral\nhead.\nEducational objective:\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis is a common hip disorder seen in overweight adolescents."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This case illustrates a typical patient with pyloric stenosis: a 4- to 6-week old male infant with projectile\nvomiting that worsens over time. The vomitus usually consists of partially undigested food. The\npathognomonic finding of a palpable olive-shaped mass in the upper abdomen is sufficient evidence to\nwarrant surgery, however, all infants must be well-hydrated and have normal or corrected electrolyte levels\nprior to any surgery. This concept of pre-surgical stabilization has led to better post-operative results. In this\ncase, the patient should be admitted and given intravenous fluids with potassium. A nasogastric tube may be\nrequired. Surgery is performed once the electrolyte levels normalize (after approximately 2-3 days).\n(Choice A) In the past, whenever a surgical disorder was diagnosed in infants, the patient was rushed to the\noperating room. This concept is now of historical interest. Surgery should never be undertaken in any infant\nwho needs resuscitation and replacement of electrolytes.\n(Choice B) Medical treatment with metoclopramide (Reglan) has no role in the treatment of pyloric stenosis.\n(Choice C) Pyloric stenosis should be corrected as soon as the infant's hydration status and electrolyte\nlevels are stabilized. Unlike surgical repair of umbilical hernias and asymptomatic atrial septal defects,\nsurgical repair of pyloric stenosis should not be delayed until school age.\n(Choice E) Patients with pyloric stenosis are given nothing by mouth (NPO, nil per os) until after the surgery\nis performed; however, simply avoiding milk products will not address the cause and treat the patient's\ncondition.\nEducational Objective:\nPyloric stenosis is treated surgically; however, surgery should be undertaken only after the infant's hydration\nstatus and electrolyte levels have been stabilized."

      "C. Obtain prothrombin time and liver function tests",
      "D. Obtain factor VIII level",
      "E. Obtain bleeding time"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This child's symptoms could be due to a bleeding disorder or to child abuse. This patient's symptoms are\nmost likely due to hemophilia because the presence of spontaneous hemarthrosis and soft tissue\nhematomas are very unlikely with any other form of bleeding disorder, including Von Willebrand's disease;\ntherefore, the best next step is to get a factor VIII level.\n(Choice A) Always rule out the medical causes before you think of child abuse in any patient.\n(Choice B) Type 1 collagen assay is used to detect osteogenesis imperfecta. Multiple fractures with\ndifferent stages of healing are characteristic of this condition. The presence of one fracture with a history of a\nfall doesn't signify osteogenesis imperfecta.\n(Choices C and E) Obtaining only the bleeding time (platelet disorder) won't provide much\ninformation. Furthermore, although all patients have their bleeding time, prothrombin time, and partial\nthromboplastin time routinely measured before having a factor VIII assay, only a factor VIII assay will yield the\ndiagnosis in this case.\nEducational Objective:\nSpontaneous hemarthrosis raises the suspicion for hemophilia, for which factor VIII assay is\ndiagnostic. Prolonged PTT, normal prothrombin time, normal bleeding time, normal fibrinogen level and low\nserum factor VIII activity are the typical lab findings. The standard treatment for hemophilia is to replace the\nfactor VIII. However, mild hemophilia may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP), which causes release of\nfactor VIII from the endothelial cells."

    "question": "A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office for a follow-up visit. She has been previously diagnosed with\nvesicoureteral reflux, and has had multiple episodes of acute urinary tract infections in the past. Intravenous\npyelography (performed on her last visit) reveals bilateral focal parenchymal scarring and blunted calyces.\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hydronephrosis",
      "B. Ureteropelvic obstruction",
      "C. Chronic pyelonephritis",
      "D. Nephrosclerosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The history (i.e, recurrent UTI secondary to reflux) and IVP findings of this girl are highly suggestive of\nchronic pyelonephritis. Chronic pyelonephritis is seen on IVP as blunting of calices (calyceal clubbing) and\nfocal parenchymal scarring.\n(Choice A) Hydronephrosis is seen on IVP as dilation of the collecting system including the calyces, pelvis\nand ureter, depending on the level of obstruction.\n(Choice B) Ureteropelvic obstruction would also lead to hydronephrotic changes in the kidney with IVP\nshowing the level of obstruction as a constriction in the flow of dye.\n(Choice D) Nephrosclerosis is a histological diagnosis, and cannot be diagnosed from IVP.\nEducational Objective:\nChronic pyelonephritis is characterized by focal parenchymal scarring and blunting of calices on IVP."

    "question": "A 3-year-old African-American female is brought to the office due to a swelling in her abdomen. According to\nher parents, this swelling was first noted when she was 3 months old, and has been increasing in size over\nthe past 6 months. It is more pronounced during crying and coughing. Examination reveals a soft swelling of\nthe umbilical region that is 3 cm in diameter and covered by skin. It can be easily reduced through the fibrous\nring at the umbilicus. The child is afebrile and in good health. What is the most likely diagnosis and best\ncourse of action for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Umbilical hernia, refer to pediatric surgeon for operative management.",
      "B. Umbilical hernia, observe for spontaneous resolution.",
      "C. Congenital omphalocele, refer to pediatric surgeon.",
      "D. Umbilical polyp, surgical excision.",
      "E. Gastroschisis, surgical management."
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Umbilical hernia is due to an imperfect closure or weakness of the umbilical ring. It is especially common in\nlow birth weight, female, and black infants. It appears as a soft swelling covered by skin that protrudes during\ncrying, coughing or straining, and can be reduced easily through the fibrous ring at the umbilicus. The hernia\nconsists of omentum or portions of the small intestine.\nMost umbilical hernias disappear spontaneously by 1 year of age. Surgery is advised if the hernia persists to\nthe age of 3-4 years, exceeds 2 cm in diameter, causes symptoms, becomes strangulated, or progressively\nenlarges after the age of 1 to 2 years.\n(Choice B) In this case, three of the above indications for surgery are present; hence, observation for\nspontaneous resolution is not the best management option.\n(Choice C) An omphalocele is a herniation or protrusion of abdominal contents into the base of the umbilical\ncord, and is usually diagnosed at birth. In contrast to the more common umbilical hernia, the sac is covered\nwith peritoneum without overlying skin. Immediate surgical repair before infections take place is essential for\nsurvival. The presence of skin covering the swelling and the age of presentation in this patient point towards\nthe diagnosis of umbilical hernia.\n(Choice D) Umbilical polyp is a rare anomaly resulting from persistence of all, or part, of the\nomphalomesenteric duct or urachus. The tissue of the polyp is firm and resistant, bright red, and has a\nmucoid secretion. Treatment is surgical excision of the entire omphalomesenteric or urachal remnant.\n(Choice E) Gastroschisis is diagnosed at birth by protrusion of bright red intestines to the right side of the\numbilicus. There is no covering of the intestines, and the umbilicus is normal. It is a surgical emergency.\nEducational Objective:\nSurgery is advised if an umbilical hernia persists to the age of 3-4 years, exceeds 2 cm in diameter, causes\nsymptoms, becomes strangulated, or enlarges progressively after the age of 1 to 2 years."

      "B. IV antibiotics",
      "C. Observation",
      "D. Splenectomy",
      "E. Intravenous immunoglobulin"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Immune thrombocytopenia usually occurs in children between 2 and 5 years of age. The pathogenesis\ninvolves antibodies that bind to platelets, and subsequent destruction of these complexes in the spleen. The\ncondition is usually preceded by a viral infection and presents with purpura, petechiae, hematuria or Gl\nbleeding. There is no adenopathy. Laboratory studies usually show no abnormalities, except\nthrombocytopenia. The course is self-limited, and spontaneous recovery occurs in the majority of\npatients. There is some controversy regarding the treatment, but in general, corticosteroids are the drugs of\nchoice in all age groups for thrombocytopenia less than 30,000/mm3, and/or for severe symptoms. Patients\nwith a platelet count of more than 30,000/mm3 usually have very few symptoms and do not require treatment.\n(Choice A) Immune thrombocytopenia is usually self-limited, and recovery occurs in the majority of\npatients. Platelet transfusion is very rarely indicated, as it generally results in only further destruction of the\nplatelets. The few indications of platelet transfusion include severe cases with active bleeding or intracranial\nbleeding.\n(Choice B) IV antibiotics are not indicated in immune thrombocytopenia, as the condition is not related to a\nbacterial infection.\n(Choice D) When there is life-threatening bleeding, the spleen may need to be removed. The spleen is the\nsite of destruction of the platelets and by excising it, the platelets are spared. It is rarely needed, but can be a\nlife-saving measure.\n(Choice E) Rarely, if the recovery is delayed and the immune attacks on the platelets continue, some may\nchoose to administer prednisone or immunoglobulin to these patients. This is more common in the\nadult type of immune thrombocytopenia.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect immune thrombocytopenia in children who develop isolated thrombocytopenia after a\nviral infection. Immune thrombocytopenia is a relatively benign condition. There is some controversy\nregarding the treatment, but in general, corticosteroids are the drugs of choice in all age groups for\nthrombocytopenia less than 30,000/mm3, and/or for severe symptoms."

    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the office for the evaluation of \"possible developmental delay.\" His birth history\nand medical histories are normal. His family history is unremarkable. He has a 9-year-old brother, who is in\ngood health. Physical examination reveals tall stature for age, long arms and legs with diminished\nsubcutaneous fat, long thin fingers, long face with crowded teeth, and prominent sternum. Hypermobility of\nthe joints, hyperelasticity of the skin with diminished recoil, and hypotonia are noted. Cardiovascular\nexamination reveals a diastolic murmur on the aortic area and along the left sternal border. Ophthalmologic\nexamination reveals iridodonesis and upward dislocation of the lens. What is the most likely etiology of his\ncondition?",
    "options": [

      "F. Congenital contractural arachnodactyly",
      "G. Defective collagen production"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's physical appearance (i.e, tall stature for age, long arms and legs with diminished\nsubcutaneous fat, long thin fingers, long face with crowded teeth, prominent sternum) is very characteristic\nfor Marfan's syndrome. His physical findings (i.e., hypermobility of the joints, hyperelastic skin with\ndiminished recoil, hypotonia, diastolic murmur, iridodonesis, lens dislocation) are classic for the\ndisease. Iridodonesis is a rapid contraction and dilation of the iris, and results from dislocation of the lens\n(ectopia lentis). The diastolic murmur has most likely resulted from aortic root dilation, which is a common\ncomplication. Other manifestations of the disease include myopia, blue sclera, mitral valve prolapse, and\ndural ectasia. The latter is defined as progressive ectasia of the dura and neural foramina, and erosion of the\nvertebral bone resulting consequently in enlargement of the spinal canal. In this case, it is possible to wrongly\nattribute the hypotonia and articular hypermobility to a developmental delay, but the clinical picture of Marfan's\nsyndrome is very characteristic, even without a positive family history. Although Marfan's syndrome is\nan autosomal dominant disorder that results from mutations of the fibrillin-1 gene, up to 30% of the cases\nmay be sporadic.\n(Choice B) The deformities in rickets (vitamin D-deficiency) are different from those found in Marfan's\nsyndrome. Such deformities include bowed legs, costochondral beading, craniotabes, and bossing of the\nskull.\n(Choice C) Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by microcephaly, mid face hypoplasia, flattened\nphiltrum, IUGR and mental retardation. Patients with Marfan's syndrome have normal intelligence.\n(Choice D) Edward's syndrome, or trisomy 18, presents with mental retardation, micrognathia, low-set ears,\nrocker bottom feet, prominent occiput, and clenched hands. (They do not survive this long)\n(Choice E) Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from cystathionine synthase\ndeficiency, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of methionine. These patients share many features of\nMarfan's syndrome, but they usually have a fair complexion, thromboembolic events and osteoporosis. The\nother main differentiating feature is the type of lens dislocation. In Marfan's syndrome, the lens is typically\ndislocated upward, whereas in homocystinuria it is dislocated downward.\n(Choice F) Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an autosomal dominant condition that presents\nwith tall stature, arachnodactyly, and multiple contractures involving large joints. Marfan's patients do not\nhave joint contractures. Furthermore, ocular and cardiovascular symptoms are not present in CCA.\n(Choice G) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a disorder of collagen structure, which may also have hypermobile\njoints; however, it also results in easy bruising, poor wound healing and soft, velvety, and hyperelastic\nskin. Severe complications such as organ rupture and severe hemorrhage may occur.\nEducational Objective:\nMSF is an autosomal dominant disorder that results from the mutations of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. It\npresents with tall stature, long and emaciated extremities, arachnodactyly, hypermobility of the joints, upward\nlens dislocation, and aortic root dilation.\nKnow this!!"

    "question": "A 6-day-old female neonate is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of jaundice. She was born to a\n17-year-old German mother at 39 weeks gestation. Her mother's blood type is B+, and was treated for\nnewborn jaundice due to presumed ABO incompatibility. Her other family members also had neonatal\njaundice. The infant's vital signs are normal. On examination, she is visibly jaundiced, and her spleen tip is\npalpable. Her total bilirubin level is 25mg/dL and direct bilirubin level is 0.4mg/dL. Her hemoglobin was\ninitially 15.7g/dL, but is now 10.7g/dL. Her reticulocyte count is 4% and platelet count is 230,000/mm3. The\nperipheral smear shows moderate schistocytes with burr cells and moderate spherocytes. Her blood type is\nB+ and Coombs' test is negative. Her stools are negative for occult blood. Her mother's incubated red cell\nosmotic fragility study is abnormal. What is the most likely cause of this neonate's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Normal physiologic changes occurring in red cells in the neonatal period",
      "B. Hereditary spherocytosis",
      "C. Hereditary elliptocytosis",
      "D. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to warm antibodies",
      "E. Isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn, due to ABO incompatibility"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A positive osmotic fragility test indicates a hemolytic disease, and confirms the diagnosis of hereditary\nspherocytosis, which is a common cause of hemolysis and hemolytic anemia in the newborn. The other\nindicators of hemolysis include reticulocytosis and hyperbilirubinemia. The peripheral smear may reveal\nanisocytosis and polychromatophilic reticulocytes and spherocytes. The typical patient is illustrated in this\ncase (i.e, jaundiced infant of Northern European descent with anemia). Severe anemia and\nhyperbilirubinemia may require phototherapy or exchange transfusions.\n(Choice A) The normal physiologic hematologic changes that occur in the neonatal period include:\n(1) switching from fetal to adult hemoglobin production, (2) a 30% drop in hemoglobin, and (3) a fall in mean\nred cell volume (MCV). Changes involving membrane pliability and intracellular enzyme levels also occur. In\nthis case, the drop in the patient's hemoglobin is more than 30 %, and her level of hyperbilirubinemia is\npathologic.\n(Choice C) Hereditary elliptocytosis is a rare disorder that is characterized by elongated red blood\ncells. Microcytes, spherocytes, and other poikilocytes may also be seen.\n(Choice D) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is confirmed by a positive Coombs’ test, and is caused by warm\nantibodies directed against the red blood cells. The typical patient is a child aged 2 to 12 years, and the\nanemia is usually acute and transient, lasting 3-6 months. It is frequently preceded by an infection, usually\nrespiratory. Spherocytosis and polychromasia may occur.\n(Choice E) Isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn (particularly due to ABO incompatibility) may also\npresent with spherocytosis, and the direct Coomb's test is used to distinguish between these two. The\ndetection of antibody on the infant's red blood cells (positive Coomb's test) establishes the diagnosis of\nimmune hemolysis.\nEducational Objective:\nA positive Coombs’ test points towards autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and a positive osmotic fragility test\npoints towards hereditary spherocytosis."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Always give a trial of epinephrine in cases of croup before intubation. Controlled trials have shown that a trial\nof racemic epinephrine should precede any invasive procedure in cases of croup, as this decreases the need\nfor intubation. Epinephrine acts by its alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic effects. In asthma, the alpha-\nadrenergic effect is beneficial by reducing bronchial secretions and mucosal edema. This similar process is\nthought to help patients with croup. In addition, the beta-adrenergic effect helps croup patients who are also\nwheezing by promoting smooth muscle relaxation.\nEducational Objective:\nRacemic epinephrine decreases the need for intubation in patients with croup and should always be tried\nbefore any invasive procedure."

      "F. Blood cultures"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "It has been estimated that fifty to eighty percent of children will have audible murmurs at some point in their\nlives; thus, it is very important to distinguish a benign (innocent) murmur from a pathologic murmur. Most\nmurmurs are functional (innocent) and without any associated structural abnormalities. An innocent murmur\nhas a systolic ejection quality, is less than III/VI in grade, and varies with position; there are usually no other\nextra sounds. The majority of children with innocent murmurs are asymptomatic, and the murmur usually\ndisappears as the child grows; therefore, observation of such patients is all that is necessary in their\nmanagement.\n(Choice A) Electrocardiogram is not routinely used in the evaluation of murmurs, although there are current\nstudies that support this practice.\n(Choice B) Pathological murmurs may indicate or lead to congenital heart disease, and are very likely when\nthe patient has any of the following:\nSymptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, syncope, and dizziness, etc.\nMurmur intensity grade 3 or higher\nAbnormal S2\nPansystolic murmur\nMurmur loudest at upper left sternal border\nAbsent or diminished femoral pulses\nMurmur's quality is unchanged with position\nWhen a murmur with any of these features is detected, investigations are required. An echocardiogram is\nusually the first step in the evaluation of pathologic murmurs. Echocardiography is diagnostic for a number of\nvalvular and congenital heart diseases in children.\n(Choice C) A Holter monitor is used for outpatient detection of arrhythmias. A Holter monitor is a portable\ndevice that is worn by the patient for several days as it records the heart rate. After a few days, the\nrecordings are analyzed to determine if there were any arrhythmias.\n(Choice E) A cardiology evaluation is not required for benign murmurs of childhood. If there is any suspicion\nof pathology, a cardiology consult is required.\n(Choice F) Blood cultures are obtained when there is a suspicion for infective endocarditis (IE). This patient\nhas no symptoms or signs suggestive of IE.\nEducational Objective:\nMost cardiac murmurs in childhood are benign and require only observation.

    "explanation": "This child has regression of milestones associated with physical findings such as hypotonia,\nhepatosplenomegaly, cervical lymphadenopathy, protruding abdomen and ‘cherry red spot’ on retinal\nexamination. This constellation of findings fits the description of Niemann-Pick's disease, which is a\nsphingolipidosis due to a deficiency in sphingomyelinase. Sphingomyelin (ceramide phosphorylcholine)\naccumulates in the reticuloendothelial cells of liver, spleen, bone marrow and brain.\n(Choice A) Sphingolipidosis due to a deficiency in hexosaminidase A is known as Tay-Sachs’ disease. It is\ncharacterized by hyperacusis, mental retardation, seizures, cherry red macula, but not hepatosplenomegaly\nor cervical lymphadenopathy.\n(Choice C) Sphingolipidosis due to a deficiency in glucocerebrosidase is known as Gaucher's disease. It is\ncharacterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, leucopoenia and thrombocytopenia, but not cherry red\nmacula.\n(Choice D) Sphingolipidosis due to a deficiency in galactocerebrosidase is known as Krabbe's disease. It is\ncharacterized by hyperacusis, irritability and seizures.\n(Choice E) Mucopolysaccharidoses are characterized by coarse facial features, hydrocephalus and\numbilical hernia.\nEducational Objective:\nDeficiency of sphingomyelinase causes Niemann-Pick's disease, which is characterized by cherry red\nmacula, protruding abdomen, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and regression of developmental\nmilestones."

    "question": "An obese Caucasian father brings his 10-year-old obese son to your office. The father states that he was\nrecently diagnosed with high cholesterol levels and coronary artery disease. Even though his son is\nasymptomatic, he is worried about the obesity. Which of the following best explains the next best step in\nmanagement?",
    "options": [
      "A. Get a fasting lipid profile",
      "B. Get a screening test for total cholesterol level",
      "C. Advise parents to start him on a low cholesterol diet",
      "D. Evaluate him for coronary artery disease",
      "E. Advise parents to start him on a regular physical exercise schedule."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The Expert Panel on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Children and Adolescents of the National Cholesterol\nEducation Program and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition have recommended\nthat children with a parental history of elevated total cholesterol levels (>=240mg/dL), or risk factors for\ncoronary heart disease should have a screening total cholesterol level.\n(Choice A) A fasting lipid profile is recommended if the total cholesterol level is greater than 200mg/dL. It is\nusually not the first step in evaluating an asymptomatic patient.\n(Choices C and E) Advising the parents to start the kid on low cholesterol diet or an exercise therapy,\nhowever helpful it may be, is not the next best step here.\n(Choice D) Evaluation for coronary heart disease is not needed in this asymptomatic patient, unless other\nrisk factors such as hypercholesterolemia are present.\nEducational objective:\nChildren with a parental history of elevated total cholesterol levels (>=240 mg/dL), or risk factors for coronary\nartery disease should get a screening test for total cholesterol level."

    "question": "An 8-year-old African American child is brought to the office for the evaluation of a 1-day history of fever and\nback pain. He has sickle cell disease, and has had 5 hospitalizations for similar painful crises. His laboratory\nreport shows normocytic anemia, reticulocytosis and leukocytosis. What finding is most likely to be present\non this patient's peripheral smear?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bite cells",
      "B. Helmet cells",
      "C. Howell Jolly bodies",
      "D. Heinz bodies",
      "E. Basophilic stippling"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sickle cell patients usually have infarcted spleens by the first 18 to 36 months of life. Repeated\nmicroinfarctions from clumping of sickle cells can destroy tissues, thereby leading to microvascular beds that\npromote sickling. The peripheral smear characteristically reveals Howell-Jolly bodies. These bodies are\nnuclear remnants of red blood cells which are generally removed by a functional spleen; therefore, their\npresence suggests splenectomy or functional asplenia. Functional asplenia renders a patient susceptible\nto infections, particularly from capsulated organisms such as pneumococci.\nIn this case, the patient has several years history of sickle cell disease and multiple, previous, similar, painful\ncrises. By this time, these repetitive occlusive events must have already damaged his spleen, leading to\nfunctional asplenia. Howell Jolly bodies are most likely to be seen in his peripheral smear.\n(Choices A and D) Heinz bodies are aggregates of denatured hemoglobin, and are commonly seen in\npatients with hemolysis due to G6PD deficiency and thalassemia. When phagocytes extract this rigid\nprecipitate, they form characteristic bite cells.\n(Choice B) Helmet cells are fragmented red blood cells. Their presence is suggestive of traumatic hemolytic\nconditions such as DIC, HUS and TTP.\n(Choice E) Basophilic stippling are ribosomal precipitates which appear as blue granules of various sizes\ndispersed throughout the cytoplasm of the red cell. These are often seen with thalassemias, as well as lead\nor heavy metal poisoning.\nEducational Objective:\nHowell-Jolly bodies are nuclear remnants of the red blood cells which are generally removed by a functional\nspleen; therefore, their presence in a peripheral smear suggests functional asplenia in sickle cell patients."

She has had two similar episodes of vomiting and nausea in the past year, which\nresolved spontaneously. The mother has a history of migraines. On examination, the child is afebrile and\nhas pallor with signs of mild dehydration. The abdomen is soft and non-tender to palpation. What is the most\nlikely cause of this child's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gastroesophageal reflux disease",
      "B. Gastroenteritis",
      "C. Mesenteric adenitis",
      "D. Cyclical vomiting",
      "E. Migraine attacks"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Recurrent self-limiting episodes of vomiting and nausea in children in the absence of any\napparent cause suggest the diagnosis of cyclical vomiting. The etiology of this condition is unclear;\nhowever, its incidence is high in children whose parents have a history of migraine\nheadaches. Complications that may arise from the condition are anemia and dehydration. Treatment\nconsists of anti-emetics and reassurance of the parents.\n(Choice E) Although migraine headaches have a higher incidence in persons with a positive family history, it\nis unlikely in the absence of headaches.\n(Choice A) Gastroesophageal reflux disease presents with regurgitation after feeding and failure to thrive.\n(Choice C) Mesenteric adenitis presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, abdominal guarding and\ntenderness.\n(Choice B) The history of recurrent self-limiting episodes of vomiting and nausea, in the absence of other\ncomplaints such as abdominal pain, diarrhea or fever, makes the diagnosis of gastroenteritis unlikely.\nEducational Objective:\nRecurrent self-limiting episodes of vomiting and nausea in children, in the absence of any apparent cause,\nsuggest the diagnosis of cyclical vomiting."

    "question": "An 11-month-old male infant is brought to the office for a well-baby examination. He was born at term and\nweighed 3.7kg (8lb) at birth. His mother's work is \"full time\" so he is mostly taken care of by his\ngrandmother. His mother is concerned that he doesn't get to go outdoors since his grandmother has\nosteoarthritis and her outdoor activity is limited. Physical examination reveals widely open fontanels and a\nping-pong-ball sensation on pressing firmly over the occiput. There are rounded enlargements on the\ncostochondral junctions, and thickening of the wrists and ankles. A horizontal depression is seen along the\nlower border of the chest. X-ray reveals cupping and fraying of the distal ends of the radius and ulna. What\nis the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Scurvy",
      "B. Vitamin D deficiency rickets",
      "C. Nonrachitic craniotabes",
      "D. Chondrodystrophy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The history, physical and radiologic findings of this infant are diagnostic for rickets. This condition usually\npresents after several months of being Vitamin D-deficient. The typical patients are low-birth weight infants,\nunsupplemented dark-skinned infants, infants with inadequate sun exposure, and solely breastfed infants.\nCommon early manifestations are craniotabes (ping-pong ball sensation over the occiput or posterior parietal\nbones), rachitic rosary (enlargement of the costochondral junctions), and thickening of the wrists and ankles.\nOther characteristic findings are Harrison groove (horizontal depression on lower border of chest) and a large\nanterior fontanelle. The diagnosis can be confirmed by obtaining the serum calcifediol level (decreased),\nalkaline phosphatase level (increased), and observing the characteristic radiologic changes (cupping and\nfraying of the distal ends of long bones, and double contour along the lateral outline of the radius). Treatment\nincludes oral Vitamin D administration and adequate sunlight (or artificial light) exposure. The current\nrecommendation to prevent rickets is oral Vitamin D supplementation, beginning during the first 2 months of\nlife and continuing until early adolescence.\n(Choice A) Scurvy is commonly seen in 6 to 24-month-old infants with a characteristic history of Vitamin C\ndeficiency. Clinical manifestations are general tenderness, pseudoparalysis (frog position), bluish-purple\nand spongy/swollen gums over the upper incisors, and depression of the sternum. A rosary similar to\nrickets may be observed, but the angulation of the beads in patients with scurvy is usually sharper than in\nthose with rickets. The diagnosis is confirmed radiologically (pencil-point thinness of the long bones’ cortex,\nand sharply outlined epiphyseal ends).\n(Choice C) Nonrachitic craniotabes is unlikely in this patient because this condition usually presents in the\nimmediate postnatal period, and disappears before rachitic softening of the skull occurs during the 2nd-4th\nmonths of life.\n(Choice D) Patients with chondrodystrophy may also manifest with \"rosary\"; however, radiologic findings will\nshow irregular, concave outlines of the distal ends of the bones. Chondrodystrophy is therefore a less likely\ndiagnosis in this patient.\nEducational Objective:\nVitamin D deficiency rickets presents with craniotabes, rachitic rosary, Harrison groove, large anterior\nfontanelle, and thickening of the lower end of the long bones. The typical patients are low-birth weight infants,\nunsupplemented dark-skinned infants, infants with inadequate sun exposure, and breastfed infants. The\ntypical pathology is - defective mineralization of growing bone or osteoid tissue."

    "question": "A father brings his 18-month-old daughter to the office for the evaluation of fever for the past 10 days. The\nfather, who works as a phlebotomist, says that the temperature seems higher in the morning and again at\nnight, often reaching 40.5C(105F), and is sometimes associated with shaking chills. He remembers that the\nchild developed severe respiratory distress and skin rash when treated with penicillin in the past. He has\nheard about the development of 'liver toxicities’ in children treated with aspirin, and he is interested in knowing\neverything about his daughter's condition. On examination, the child is in no acute distress. Her temperature\nis 39.4C(103F), pulse rate is 90/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg. Her sclerae are anicteric. There\nis bulbar conjunctival injection, and the oropharynx shows diffuse mucosal injection with fissuring and\ncrusting of the lips. There are numerous hyperemic macules over her entire body, and her palms appear\nedematous. Based on the above description, which of the following is the most accurate statement?",
    "options": [
      "A. Latex agglutination test is more accurate than streptococcal throat test in determining the etiology of this condition",
      "B. Immediate desensitization & treatment with penicillin IV will prevent further renal complications",
      "C. Thrombocytopenia is an important marker in the second week of this illness",
      "D. Acetaminophen is the drug of choice for alleviation of high temperatures in this child",
      "E. She needs to be hospitalized and treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and aspirin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The case in question satisfies the criteria of Kawasaki's disease, which are:\n1. Fever for >= 5 days, and\n2. Four of the following symptoms:\nBulbar conjunctival injection\nDesquamation of the finger and toe tips, indurative edema\nErythema, fissuring, and crusting of the lips, strawberry tongue, and diffuse mucosal injection\nof the oropharynx\nMorbilliform truncal exanthem\nCervical lymphadenopathy\nKawasaki disease or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is one of the most common causes of\ngeneralized vasculitis in children. It is usually self-limited, although it can be fatal because of giant aneurysm\nformation, thrombosis or rupture of the coronary arteries, leading to myocardial infarction. 2D\nechocardiography is used to assess cardiac function and coronary vasculature. A baseline\nechocardiography is to be performed within 7 days of the disease onset, then repeated 6 to 8 weeks later.\n(Choice A) The most common condition with which Kawasaki's disease is confused is scarlet fever;\nhowever, scarlet fever will have a positive streptococcal throat test and normal-appearing lips, as opposed to\nnegative streptococcal throat test and inflamed lips in Kawasaki's disease. Latex agglutination test is more\nrapid but less accurate in the diagnosis of scarlet fever.\n(Choice B) The treatment of choice for scarlet fever is a ten-day course of penicillin V; however, in\npenicillin-allergic patients, erythromycin or clindamycin can be used. Treatment of scarlet fever with penicillin\ndoesn't prevent post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\n(Choice C) The laboratory abnormalities associated with Kawasaki's disease are increased acute phase\nreactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein, leukocytosis,\nnormochromic-normocytic anemia, and thrombocytosis (not thrombocytopenia). Thrombocytosis is a non-specific finding and\ndoes not characterize this illness.\n(Choice D) Fever in Kawasaki's disease poorly responds to acetaminophen. All patients with suspected\nKawasaki disease should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and high-dose\naspirin. The mainstays of systemic treatment of Kawasaki's disease are intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\nand aspirin. Aspirin is useful for fever and arthritis. IVIG has been shown to reduce the incidence of coronary\nartery aneurysms and other complications. If untreated, up to 25 percent of these patients may develop\ncoronary artery aneurysms.\nEducational Objective:\nAlthough, it is typically a self-limited condition, all patients with suspected Kawasaki disease should be\nhospitalized and treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and high-dose aspirin. If untreated, up to 25\npercent of these patients may develop coronary artery aneurysms."

      "D. Deficiency of branching enzyme activity",
      "E. Liver phosphorylase deficiency"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency is also known as type I glycogen storage disease and Von-Gierke's\ndisease. As its name suggests, this condition is caused by deficient glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver,\nkidneys, and intestinal mucosa. The typical patient, as described in the vignette, is 3-4 months of age with\nhypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. Hypoglycemic seizures may occur. The\ncharacteristic features include a doll-like face (i.e., fat cheeks), thin extremities, short stature, and a\nprotuberant abdomen (due to the enlarged liver and kidneys). The spleen and heart are normal.\n(Choice B) Acid maltase deficiency is also known as type II glycogen storage disease and Pompes'\ndisease. Although patients with this condition also have hepatomegaly, they usually present in the first few\nweeks of life as a \"floppy baby\" with feeding difficulties, macroglossia, and heart failure (due to progressive\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy).\n(Choice C) Type III glycogen storage disease is caused by a deficiency of glycogen debranching enzyme\nactivity. Similar clinical manifestations (e.g., hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and growth\nretardation) may make it initially difficult to distinguish from type I glycogen storage disease; however, their\nlaboratory findings differ. Patients with glycogen storage III disease have elevated levels of liver\ntransaminases, fasting ketosis, and normal blood lactate and uric acid concentrations. Other pertinent\nfindings are splenomegaly and normal kidneys.\n(Choice D) Deficiency of branching enzyme activity results in type IV glycogen storage disease or\namylopectinosis. The typical patient is in his first 18 months of life with hepatosplenomegaly and failure to\nthrive. The most common pathology is progressive cirrhosis of the liver.\n(Choice E) Patients with liver phosphorylase deficiency have a benign course, and typically present with\nhepatomegaly and growth retardation early in childhood. Mild hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperketosis\nmay occur. Lactic acid and uric acid levels are normal.\nEducational Objective:\nThe typical patient with glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency is 3-4 months of age with hypoglycemia, lactic\nacidosis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. The characteristic appearance is a doll-like face (i.e. fat\ncheeks), thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen (due to the enlarged liver and kidneys).\nHypoglycemic seizures may occur."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The onset of headaches, accompanied by focal neurologic symptoms soon after an episode of acute otitis\nmedia, is highly suggestive of a brain abscess. Although the incidence of otogenic brain abscess is\ndeclining, otitis media still remains as an important cause of brain abscesses. Headaches are the most\ncommon symptom of brain abscess, but are very non-specific. Focal neurologic signs develop in 50% of\npatients, usually days to weeks after the onset of headaches. Fever is present in less than half of the\npatients with a brain abscess; therefore, it is not a reliable sign. Papilledema on funduscopic examination is a\nlater sign and indicates significant cerebral edema; it is observed in 25% of patients. Other diagnoses listed\nare less likely in this patient. CT or MRI scan will show ring-enhancing lesions.\n(Choice A) Todd's palsy is characterized by transient hemiplegia that occurs after a seizure.\n(Choices B, C and D) Patients with brain tumors rarely present with such a short history of the disease.\nFurthermore, papilledema is a characteristic finding of this disease.\n(Choice F) The absence of fever makes the diagnosis of meningitis unlikely.\n(Choices H and I) Stroke is a rare cause of neurologic abnormalities in children, and an obvious cause or\nprecipitating factor is usually present (e.g., congenital heart disease).\n(Choice K) Carotid artery dissection typically develops after trauma.\nEducational Objective:\nA patient with an acute onset of headaches and focal neurologic symptoms after an episode of acute otitis\nmedia or sinusitis most likely has a brain abscess.

The clinical manifestations include a classic\ntetrad of rash, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and renal disease. This tetrad can occur in any order and at any\ntime over a period of several days to several weeks. The rash is typically purpuric and distributed\nsymmetrically over the lower legs, buttocks and arms. Arthralgias most commonly affect the knees and\nankles. These symptoms are always transient, and there is no permanent damage to the joints.\nGastrointestinal symptoms are present in the majority of patients, and most commonly include colicky\nabdominal pain (presumably due to local vasculitis) that is frequently associated with vomiting. Renal\ninvolvement is common and not necessarily related to the severity of extrarenal involvement. Most patients\nhave relatively mild disease characterized by asymptomatic hematuria and proteinuria with a normal or only\nslightly elevated plasma creatinine concentration; however, more marked findings may occur including the\nnephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and acute renal failure. In addition, other organs or systems, such as the\nlung and central nervous system, may be involved.

The syndrome results from a full\nmutation in the FMR1 gene caused by an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats accompanied by\naberrant methylation of the FMR1 gene.\n(Choices D and E) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autistic disorder may be presenting features of\nFragile X syndrome, but by themselves do not explain the other clinical findings in this child.\n(Choice B) Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by mild to moderate mental retardation, hypo-plastic\nmaxilla, long philtrum and microcephaly.\n(Choice A) Down's syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, microcephaly, flat occiput, Simian\ncrease, endocardial cushion defects, prominent tongue, epicanthal folds with slanting eyes, and Brush field's\nspots on the periphery of the iris.\nEducational Objective:\nFragile X syndrome is characterized by low to normal IQ with learning disabilities, generalized language\ndisability, short attention span, autism, large head, prominent jaw, large low set ears and macroorchidism."

    "question": "A 15-year-old African-American girl has a facial rash and vague joint pains. Her temperature is 37.2C(99F).\nOn examination, a malar erythematous rash is noted. Her laboratory evaluation is significant for\nanemia, leukopenia, and a normal platelet count. Her antinuclear antibody and Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR)\ntests are positive. Which of the following tests is confirmatory for this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. VDRL (Veneral Disease Research Laboratory) test",
      "B. FTA (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody) test",
      "C. Anti-Smith antibody test",
      "D. Coomb's test",
      "E. Bone marrow examination"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The child has features suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). One-fifth of all SLE cases occur\nin children. The confirmatory tests are anti-Smith antibody test and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) test.\n(Choice D) Coomb's test is used for the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Although it may be\npositive in patients with SLE, it is not useful in confirming the diagnosis.\n(Choice E) Bone marrow examination is also not useful in confirming the diagnosis of SLE.\n(Choices A and B) SLE is often associated with false positive RPR test results. RPR (Rapid Plasma\nReagin) and VDRL tests are used in the diagnosis of syphilis, but both have high false positive rates in\npatients with SLE. The FTA test is more specific for the diagnosis of syphilis, but is of no use in SLE.\nEducational Objective:\nPositive anti-Smith antibodies and/or anti-double stranded DNA antibodies is specific and confirmatory for the\ndiagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus."

    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency department after falling on his outstretched hand. He\nimmediately complained of right arm pain after the accident, and he currently cannot move his arm due to\nthe pain. He is crying and holding his right arm in flexion. There is ecchymosis just above his elbow. He\ncries out in pain when his arm is moved. An x-ray reveals a supracondylar fracture. What secondary\ninjury is most commonly associated with this patient's fracture?",
    "options": [
      "A. Median nerve injury",
      "B. Axillary nerve injury",
      "C. Ulnar artery injury",
      "D. Brachial artery injury",
      "E. Brachial plexus injury"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Supracondylar fractures are the most common fractures in the pediatric population. It is rarely seen in adults,\nand the majority result from trauma. The most common complication is entrapment of the brachial artery,\nresulting in loss of the radial artery pulse; therefore, all patients with a supracondylar fracture must have their\nradial pulse checked. After reduction of the fracture, the radial pulse must be reassessed.\n(Choice A) The median nerve is spared in a supracondylar fracture. Once the fracture is reduced, the\nedema subsides and the paresthesias in the arm subside.\n(Choice B) The axillary artery is injured during proximal humerus fractures, but not with supracondylar\nfractures.\n(Choice C) The ulnar artery is not directly injured with supracondylar fractures. If the brachial artery is\ncompromised with the fracture, the ulnar pulse will disappear.\n(Choice E) Brachial plexus injury is not common with supracondylar fractures.\nEducational Objective:\nWith supracondylar fractures, the brachial artery can be compromised, resulting in the loss of the radial\nartery pulse; therefore, the radial artery pulse must be assessed when the fracture is reduced."
