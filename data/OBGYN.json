    "question": "A 24-year-old African American female presents in the 35th week of an uncomplicated pregnancy with numbness and burning in her right palm. She says the sensation is so uncomfartable that it frequently makes it difficult to sleep. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Indomethacin",
      "B. Oral corticosteroids",
      "C. Local corticosteroid injection",
      "D. Wrist splinting",
      "E. Decompression surgery"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, making carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a median nerve compression neuropathy, the most likely diagnosis. CTS symptoms are worsened by manual activity and often wake the patient from sleep. Repetitive wrist flexion and extension is the usual cause of CTS. The incidence is increased in pregnancy secandary to an estrogen-mediated depolymerization of ground substance, which causes interstitial edema in the hands (and face) and thus increased pressure within the carpal tunnel. Prolonged or repetitive wrist flexion and extension alsa increase carpal tunnel pressure. Therefore, the initial treatment is a neutral position wrist splint.\n(Choice A) While NSAIDs may decrease the pain assaciated with carpal tunnel syndrome, their use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and may promote premature closure af the fetal ductus arteriosus.\n{Choices B & C) When splinting and analgesics fail to relieve CTS symptoms, direct injection of carticosteraids into the carpal tunnel may help.\n(Choice E) For CTS symptoms resistant to conservative interventions, ar if hand weakness and thenar muscle atrophy progresses, then apen or endoscopic surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel is indicated.\nEducational objective:\nFaresthesias or pain in the distribution of the median nerve during pregnancy is likely to be due to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Initial treatments far CTS invalve neutral position wrist splinting and NSAIDs. Local corticosteroid injection is indicated in cases where wrist splinting is insufficient to relieve symptoms. Surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel is reserved for cases when conservative management fails."

    "question": "A 27-year-old female at 30 weeks gestation complains of difficulty hearing, especially on the right side. She denies any ear pain or discharge. Her pregnancy was complicated by acute pyelonephritis at 22 weeks gestation, which was treated with antibiotics. She does not smoke or consume alcohol, and she eats a balanced diet. She has no preexisting medical problems and takes no medications aside from a multivitamin. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg and heart rate is 75/min. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations are unremarkable. No focal abnormalities are found on neurologic examination. When a tuning fork is placed on the right mastoid process, she appreciates the tone louder than when it is held near the external auditory meatus. Audiometry shows right low-frequency hearing loss. Which of the following is the mast likely cause of this patient's complaints?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antibiotic treatment",
      "B. Hypertension of pregnancy",
      "C. Meniere's disease",
      "D. Otosclerosis",
      "E. Chronic otitis media",
      "F. Acoustic neuroma",
      "G. Presbycusis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The above vignette describes the Rinne test in which a tuning fark is placed over the mastoid process and then to the ear. In a normal patient, the tone is typically louder when placed next to the ear as opposed to on the mastoid process, indicating increased air conduction compared to bane conduction. Bone conduction that is greater than air conduction in an ear with hearing loss is suggestive of conductive hearing loss. The normal finding of air greater than bone conduction can also be found in sensorineural hearing loss. This test can be used in conjunction with the Weber test, which helps to localize the side of decreased hearing by placing the tuning fork in the midline of the face and asking the patient which side sounds louder. The most likely diagnosis in this particular case is otosclerosis, and the patient's pregnancy and recent episode of pyelonephritis are likely unrelated. Otosclerosis is the most common cause of conductive hearing loss in adults, and is most common in patients in their 20's and 30's. There is a slight female predominance. In atosclerosis, the stapes footplate becomes fixed to the aval window, resulting in loss of its piston action. This disorder is sometimes also referred to as otospongiosis because CT may show a lucent (as opposed to sclerotic) focus in the temporal bone near the oval window. Therefore, CT could be used to confirm the diagnosis in this case.\n(Choice A) Ototoxic antibiotics such as aminoglycosides usually result in sensorineural as opposed to conductive hearing loss.\n(Choice B) This patient's high blood pressure will likely require further evaluation and treatment, but it is unlikely to be contributing ta her hearing loss.\n(Choice C) Meniere's disease affects the inner ear and typically presents with aural fullness, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss.\n(Choice E) Chronic otitis media may cause conductive hearing loss, but it is typically accompanied by pain and can easily be diagnosed by otoscopic examination.\n(Choice F) An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, typically results in sensorineural hearing loss.\n(Choice G) Presbycusis is sensorineural hearing loss that occurs in adults with advanced age.\nEducational objective:\nBone conduction that is greater than air conduction on the Rinne test is suggestive of conductive hearing loss. The most commaon cause of conductive hearing loss in adults (particularly young adults) is otosclerosis."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents for her first prenatal visit. She is 10 weeks pregnant as determined by her last menstrual period. She does nat have any medical problems and does not take any medications. She is devoutly religious and has been in a monogamous relationship with her husband since getting married 5 years aga. They live in a house built in 1983 where she works as a homemaker. Her husband is an accountant. She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Which of the following screening tests is indicated at this time?",
    "options": [
      "A. Rapid plasma reagin test",
      "B. Hepatitis C antibody",
      "C. Serum lead level",
      "D. Red blood cell folic acid level",
      "E. Chlamydia PCR"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "It is recommended that all pregnant women be screened for syphilis regardless of risk factors. Screening should be performed at the first prenatal visit and is typically accomplished via the rapid plasma reagin (FPR) ar venereal disease research laboratory (WVDRL) test. When the screening test is positive, the diagnosis can be confirmed with the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Treatment is with penicillin.\n(Choice B) There is no indication for hepatitis C screening in low-risk adults, pregnant or otherwise. This patient does nat have any obvious risk factors for hepatitis C infection.\n(Choice C) The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against testing lead levels in asymptomatic pregnant women. The incidence of lead toxicity in the United States is low and there are no studies to suggest that screening and treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women is beneficial.\n(Choice D) Folic acid deficiency early in pregnancy is associated with neural tube defects in newborns. The USPSTF and other organizations recommend that women of child-bearing age eat a diet rich in falic acid and/or take a folic acid supplement. Routine testing of folic acid levels is not indicated, however.\n(Choice E) The USFSTF recommends screening for Chlamydia infection in all women age 24 and younger and those at increased risk (history of sexual transmitted infections, new or multiple partners). This pregnant woman is nat at increased risk and thus does not require screening.\nEducational objective:\nScreening for syphilis is strongly recommended in all pregnant wamen, regardless of their risk factors far sexually transmitted infections."

    "question": "A 35-year-old female complains of nipple discharge. The discharge is from both breasts, brown in color and accurs intermittently. She has two children who are 5 and 8 years old. She has nat been recently pregnant. Her last menstrual period was one week ago. She describes no other symptoms. Examination shows normal breasts without palpable lumps ar nipple abnormalities. Brownish discharge is expressed from the nipples, and it is guaiac negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mammogram",
      "B. Ultrasonogram",
      "C. Cytologic examination",
      "D. Serum prolactin and TSH levels",
      "E. Surgical evaluation",
      "F. No further workup"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The woman's nipple discharge is most consistent with galactorrhea. Galactorrhea presents as bilateral nipple discharge that is most often milky or clear in color, but can also be yellow, brown, or green. Further evaluation for the causes of galactorrhea should thus be pursued in this patient via testing of serum prolactin and TSH levels.\nThe red flags to watch out for in cases of nipple discharge are unilateral secretion, guaiac positive fluid, and breast lump. In the case of bilateral guaiac negative discharge, and in the absence of a breast mass, mammography is not necessary. The patient can be reassured that breast cancer is very unlikely.\nPregnancy, another camman cause of bilateral nipple discharge, is unlikely given that the patient had her LMP ane week ago.\n(Choice A) Mammography is used both in screening for breast cancer, and in evaluating certain cases of breast lump or nipple discharge. If this patient had blood or guaiac positive fluid in her nipple discharge, or a breast lump an exam, mammagraphy would be indicated.\n(Choice B) Ultrasonogram is one test that can be used in the evaluation of a breast mass. It is most useful at discerning fluid-filled masses from solid masses, evaluating the denser breast tissue of younger women, and in guided biopsies. Ultrasound is not part of the wark-up for galactorrhea.\n(Choice C) Cytologic examination is indicated in cases of uniductal and quaiac positive nipple discharge. It allows the pathologist to examine cells from the duct to distinguish carcinoma, praliferative changes, and inflammatory processes. Itis nat indicated for guaiac negative discharge.\n(Choice E) Surgical evaluation would have been indicated for this patient had her nipple discharge invalved grass blood, tested guaiac positive, ar been associated with a breast lump.\n(Choice F) Galactorrhea has many potential causes. Depending on the etiology, it can be associated with infertility and other health issues. Further testing is indicated.\nEducational objective:\nGalactarrhea presents as guaiac negative bilateral nipple discharge. Prolactinoma, hypothyroidism, averstimulation of the nipple, oral contraceptive pills, and medications which lower dopamine levels are comman causes. Workup includes ruling out pregnancy, measuring serum prolactin and TSH levels, and possible MRI of the brain to rule out prolactinoma."

    "question": "A 19-year-old primigravid woman at 34 weeks' gestation presents far a routine prenatal visit. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated to date. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She takes one multivitamin and ane iron tablet daily. She has no known drug allergies. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with 34 weeks gestational age. Routine clean-catch urine culture grows greater than 100,000 calonies/mL of Escherichia coli. Which of the following is the mast appropriate pharmacatherapy?",
    "options": [
      "A. Amoxicillin",
      "B. Ciprofloxacin",
      "C. Clindamycin",
      "D. Doxycycline",
      "E. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This woman has asymptomatic bacteriuria, a positive urine culture in the absence of urinary tract symptoms. Guidelines dictate that pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated with antibiotics in order to decrease invasive urinary tract infections, preterm deliveries, and low birth weight children. The evidence for treatment is most robust far women between 12 and 16 weeks' gestation, but some autharities extend this recommendation throughout pregnancy. Far a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy, the recommended antibiotics are amaxicilling nitrofurantoin, or an oral cephalosparin.\n(Choice B) Ciprofloxacin is a first-line agent in the treatment of pyelonephritis and may also be used far uncomplicated cystitis in non-pregnant adults. Fluaroguinolones are class C drugs in pregnancy because they have the potential to cause arthropathy in the unborn fetus.\n{Choice C) Clindamycin is a class B medication in pregnancy. While it would probably be safe far this woman, it is a poar chaice for urinary tract infections because it has no gram negative coverage.\n(Choice D) Doxycycline and other tetracycline antibiotics are class D medications in pregnancy. They interfere with tooth development and should not be used in the secand half of pregnancy or in children less than B years of age.\n{Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazale is a class C medication in pregnancy. It may be used during the second trimester but is not recommended for use during the first trimester because it interferes with folic acid metabalism ar during the third trimester because it increases the risk of kernicterus in the newborn.\nEducational objective:\nIt is strongly recommended that asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women be treated, especially women at 12-16 weeks' gestation. Recommended antibiotics include amoxicillin, nitrofurantain, and aral cephalosporins."

    "question": "A 22-year-old woman is being followed by her family physician during her first pregnancy. She is currently at 28 weeks’ gestation, feeling well, and gaining an appropriate amount of weight. She has not had sexual intercourse far the past 15 weeks. Her first prenatal exam was at 12 weeks’ gestation, at which time her HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, Rh{D}-antibody, and urine cultures were negative. Her blood type is A negative. She does not know who the father of the child is but is excited to raise the child with the help of her mather. She is unable to recall or confirm her immunization status for a number of vaccines. Which of the following measures is warranted at this time?",
    "options": [
      "A. MMR vaccination",
      "B. Urine culture",
      "C. Rh(D) antibody test",
      "D. HIV antibody test",
      "E. Pneumococcal vaccine"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends Rh-blood typing and testing for Rh antibodies at the first prenatal visit, as well as repeat Rh antibody testing at 28 weeks’ in unsensitized women with Rh-pasitive ar Rh-unknown partners. This particular patient is Rh-negative and does not know the father's Rh status; thus, her Rh antibody status should be rechecked at this time.\n(Choice A) In pregnant women whose immunization status is unknown ar unconfirmed, the physician should check for rubella immunity. However, the live MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. Instead, susceptible individuals should be advised to avoid individuals potentially infected with rubella.\n(Choice B) Screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria between 12 and 16 weeks’ gestation significantly decreases symptomatic urinary tract infections, lower birth weight babies, and preterm deliveries, and is strongly recommended by the USPSTF. This woman has already been screened and is not known to have predisposing risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections like urinary tract anomalies, sickle cell disease, etc.\n(Choice D) The USF STF strongly recommends that pregnant women be screened for HIV infection at the first prenatal visit because early initiation of anti-retroviral medications can significantly decrease disease transmission to the fetus. This patient had a negative test at her first visit and, given her lack of new expasures, does not need to be rescreened.\n(Choice E) It is recommended that pregnant women be vaccinated against influenza but not against PNEeumococcUs.\nEducational objective:\nAf the first prenatal visit, blood typing and Rh antibody testing (in Rh-negative women) should be performed. Unsensitized Rh-negative women potentially carrying an Rh-positive fetus should have their Rh antibody status retested between 24 and 28 weeks’ gestation. Patients at risk of alloimmunization should be given anti-Rh immune glabin at 28 weeks and again at the time of delivery."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The Centers for Disease Cantrol (COC) recommend that all pregnant wamen without contraindications receive the influenza vaccination.\n(Choice B) Hemoglobin electrophoresis is only recommended far patients at high risk for transmitting a hemaoglobinopathy based on family history, and is not routine.\n(Choice C) There is no indication for the routine evaluation of hepatitis C status in patients at low risk.\n(Choice D) The USF STF recommends that all pregnant women age 24 and younger, as well as alder pregnant women at elevated risk {new or multiple partners, history of sexually transmitted infections, etc), be screened far chlamydial infection. The USPSTF does not recammend routine testing in women age 25 and alder at average risk for Chlamydia.\n(Choice E) The USFSTF recammends that high-risk sexually active women (age 24 and younger, new ar multiple partners, history of sexually transmitted infections), including those who are pregnant, be screened for gonorrhea. Treatment decreases the risk of premature rupture of membranes, preterm labar, and charioamnianitis. This woman does not fall within the recommended age range for screening and is atherwise at average risk.\n(Choice F) All pregnant women should have their fasting blood sugar tested at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.

    "explanation": "This patient has steroid-induced folliculitis, ar steroid acne, secondary to the prednisone she is using for her SLE flare. Steroid acne is characterized by manomaorphous pink papules and absence of comedanes.\n(Choice A) Adolescent acne is characterized by open and closed comedones and inflammatory nodules in differing stages of evalution primarily affecting the face, chest and back.\n{Choice B) Androgen abuse is a possible cause of bath acne vulgaris and steroid-induced acne. One of the main pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying acne vulgaris is androgen excess. Given her history, steroid acne is mare likely.\n(Choice C) In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) there is an underlying excess of serum androgens. As such, it is commonly associated with acne vulgaris. Other findings in PCOS include irregular menses, anavulation, and hirsutism.\n(Choice E) Systemic lupus erythematosus itself is not a common cause of acneiform lesions. The skin finding most classic for SLE is an erythematous malar eruption.\nEducational objective:\nSystemic and topical corticosteroids can induce an acneifarm eruption characterized by monomarphous, erythematous follicular papules distributed an the face, trunk and extremities. Comedaones are characteristically absent."

    "question": "A 34-year-old sexually active female comes to your office because of urinary frequency and dysuria for two days. She has had two such episodes in the past, each treated with oral antibiotics. Fhysical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness and her urinalysis is positive far nitrite, leukocyte esterase, many WBC, and a maderate amount of bacteria. Which of the following is the most common reason for the higher incidence of urinary tract infections in females than in males?",
    "options": [
      "A. Closer proximity of the urethral meatus to the anus in females",
      "B. Frequent use of spermicide and diaphragms in females",
      "C. Shorter urethral length in females",
      "D. Higher post-void urine residual in females",
      "E. Harmonal fluctuation of females"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Urinary tract infections (UTI) are mare commanly seen in females than males, and half of all adult wamen have a UTI at same time in their life. The high incidence of UTI's in wamen is primarily due ta the shorter length of the female urethra. After the periurethral area becomes colonized by rectal flora, the bacteria ascend to the bladder to cause infection. This is facilitated in females by a short urethra. Predisposing factors for UTI's include alteration of the normal vaginal flara by recent antibiotic use, sexual intercourse, diaphragm or spermicide use, ar a family history of multiple UTI's.\nMales, on the other hand, are less likely to develop a UTI mainly because they have a longer urethra than females. They alsa have a drier periurethral environment and antibacterial substances in prostatic fluid, which alsa help to fight off infection.\n(Choice A) A shorter distance between the anus and urethra in women is associated with a higher incidence af recurrent UTI's within the female population, but is nat the main reasan for the difference in UTI frequency between men and women.\n(Choice B) Spermicide and diaphragm use are risk factors for UTI's in females. A sharter urethral length in females, however, is responsible for their higher frequency of UTl's compared to males.\n{Choice D) Increased post-void urine residual is nat associated with a higher incidence of recurrent UTl's in females.\n(Choice E) Female hormonal fluctuation is not related to an increased incidence of UTl's in females.\nEducational objective:\nThe increased incidence of urinary tract infections in women is due ta the shorter length of the female urethra compared to males. Other predisposing factars for UTl's include sexual intercourse, recent antibiotic use, the use of spermicidal contraceptives, and a clase proximity of the urethra ta the anus."

Which of the following is the mast appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Estrogen levels",
      "B. Serum LH levels",

      "F. Reassurance"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has primary amenarrhea and underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics. Isolated amenorrhea with well-developed secondary sexual characteristics can be considered normal up to the age of 16. However, if secondary sexual characteristics are absent as with this patient, work-up should not be delayed. The absence of breast development indicates a lack of estrogen, so measuring estragen levels pravides no additional information.\nPrimary amenarrhea can be due to either hypothalamic/pituitary abnormalities (central), or to gonadal (peripheral) abnormalities. The distinction can be made by measurement of the FSH level (Choice C). Increased FSH indicates a peripheral cause and decreased FSH indicates a central cause. If amenorrhea is of central arigin, a GnRH stimulation test is then indicated to detect whether the anomaly is of hypothalamic ar pituitary origin. If amenorrhea is of peripheral arigin, karyotyping would be the next step. If FSH is normal, this establishes the diagnosis of ovarian agenesis or dysgenesis. Measurement of LH has no diagnostic value.\nEducational objective:\nIn a patient with primary amenorrhea:\n# FSH measurement should be ordered if there is no breast development\n# GnRH stimulation test is the next step if FSH is decreased\n# Karyotyping is the next step if FSH is increased"

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient described has mild preeclampsia. Mild preeclampsia is defined clinically by hypertension greater than 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria greater than 0.3g/24h (300mg/24h) after the 20th week of gestation. Dependent and nondependent edema is also commanly present though edema is a comman finding in pregnancy in general.\n(Choice B) Severe preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension greater than 160/110 mmHg, proteinuria greater than 5g/24h, aliguria, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia and possibly pulmonary edema.\n(Choices C & F) Chronic hypertension in pregnancy implies hypertension that is not pregnancy induced such as essential hypertension. Itis diagnosed when hypertension exists prior to pregnancy ar when it appears before the 20th week of gestation. If proteinuria appears during the course of pregnancy, the candition is then called chranic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia.\n(Choice D) Transient hypertension occurs in the second half of pregnancy or during labar and delivery. Proteinuria may be present but does not exceed 300mg/24hr. If at some point the proteinuria exceeds 300mg/24hr, the diagnosis of preeclampsia is made.\n(Choice E) Eclampsia is defined as the occurrence of grand mal seizures in patients with either mild ar severe preeclampsia.\nEducational objective:\nMild preeclampsia is defined clinically by hypertension greater than 140/30 mmHg and proteinuria greater than 0.3g/24h (300mg/24h) after the 20th week of gestatian."

      "D. Nitroprusside",
      "E. Verapamil"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The most definitive treatment for preeclampsia and eclampsia is delivery of the fetus, but delivery of a fetus at 32 weeks gestation would cause harm to the fetus that is greater than continuing the pregnancy closer to term. Management in this setting would include monitoring and bed rest as well as an antihypertensive medication. Methyldopa has a lang history of safety in pregnancy and is considered the first-line treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. Methyldopa functions as a centrally-acting alpha adrenergic agonist thereby decreasing sympathetic outflow and producing vasodilation.\n(Choice A) Lisinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy as they can cause fetal renal dysgenesis and fetal death.\n(Choice C) Furosemide and other diuretics are typically avoided in pregnancy as they can prevent the normal physiologic intravascular volume expansion that occurs as a normal function of pregnancy.\n(Choice D) Mitroprusside is a pregnancy categary C agent, but its production of cyanide as a metabolic byproduct makes it a less favorable option for use in pregnancy.\n{Choice E) Verapamil is a calcium channel blacker and is pregnancy category C, meaning its safety in pregnancy has not yet been established. Of the calcium channel blockers, nifedipine is mare cammanly used than verapamil in pregnancy.\nEducational objective:\nMethyldopa is a pregnancy category B agent and is the first-line medication far treatment of hypertension in pregnancy."

      "D. Colposcopy",
      "E. Endometrial curettage"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The management of a low-grade squamaus epithelial lesion (LSIL) differs based on the age of the patient. In general, LSIL discovered on cervical cytology indicates the presence of cytologically atypical squamaus cells an the cervix. The atypicality of these cells may be due to HPY infection ar cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIM is graded as type 1 — 3. The majority of LSIL lesions not attributable simply to HPV infection are CIM 1, which does not require treatment, only observation. Uncommanly, LSIL may be observed in the setting of CIN 2 or 3, which require treatment. In an adolescent female the abnarmal cervical cells are most likely due to HP infection. Because frank cervical cancer in this population is uncammaon, the best management strategy is a follow-up Pap smear in 1 year. Mast LSIL lesions in this population will resolve spontaneausly.\nLow grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL)\n(Mild dysplasia (or) CIN 1)\nAdolescents -> Repeat Pap in 12 months\nPremenopausal woman -> Colposcopy\nPostmenopausal woman -> Reflex HPV testing -> (If ‘positive’) Colposcopy\n(Choice A) Repeat Pap smear in 2 weeks is not a routine method used to follow-up an abnormal Fap smear.\n(Choice C) Reflex HPV testing in this population where the incidence of HPV is quite high is not likely to assist in making or excluding the diagnosis of cervical neoplasia.\n(Choice D) Colposcopy is not typically done in adolescents with low-grade lesions as LSIL and ASCUS lesions tend ta resalve spontaneously in the overwhelming majarity of cases. The patient should, however, be monitored far this resolution or a progression of her lesion with a repeat Pap smear in ane year.\n(Choice E) Endometrial curettage is a diagnostic test used in making the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Endocervical curettage is used to obtain tissue far histologic examination following an abnormal Pap smear when a colposcopy is indicated and a lesion can not be identified or when atypical glandular lesions are identified.\nEducational objective:\nIn adolescent females, ASCUS or LSIL cervical lesions are mast likely due to HPV infection. Because frank cervical cancer in this population is uncommon, the best management strategy is a follow-up Pap smear in 1 year."

    "explanation": "The patient described has mast likely had an intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). IUFD is the death of a fetus in utero that occurs after 20 weeks gestation and before the anset of labor. IUFD is suspected when the patient reparts the disappearance of fetal movements, a decrease or stagnation in uterine size or when fetal heart sounds are no longer heard. Beta-hCG levels may continue to be elevated due to ongoing placental production of that harmaone. Ultrasonography is a mare reliable tool for confirming the diagnosis; it demonstrates an absence of fetal movement and fetal cardiac activity.\n(Choice A) The diagnosis of IUFD requires confirmation with ultrasonography befare any further action can be taken.\n{Choice B) A non-stress test is irrelevant since it is suspected that the fetus is dead. IUFD needs to be canfirmed by demanstrating the absence of fetal heart movement on ultrasonogram.\n(Choice C) Serum beta-hCG levels are nat useful because they usually remain elevated due to ongaing placental production.\n{Choice D) Monitoring the coagulation profile should be done as IUFD can cause maternal coagulopathy. The diagnosis should first be confirmed by ultrasonography.\nEducational objective:\nThe most appropriate test to canfirm the diagnasis of intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) is real time ultrasanography to demonstrate an absence of fetal movement and cardiac activity."

    "explanation": "Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) is the death of a fetus in utero that occurs after 20 weeks gestation and before the anset of labor. It can be caused by a multitude of conditions such as hypertensive disarders, diabetes mellitus, placental and card complications, antiphasphalipid syndrome, congenital anomalies and fetal infections such as the TORCH infections ar listeriosis. However, the cause remains unknown in 50% of cases. tis very important to try to diagnose the cause of the fetal demise after the first episode in arder to prevent, if possible, a recurrence of the same issue in any subsequent pregnancies. Autopsy of the fetus and placenta should be performed.\n(Choice A) There is a 1 ta 8 % risk of recurrent still birth in mothers who have previously experienced IUFD.\n(Choice B) Serial beta-HCG manitaring is required if there is a suspicion far malar pregnancy.\n(Choice C) Serial testing of fibrinogen levels is performed to detect a consumptive coagulopathy early in its course in patients with IUFD managed with watchful expectancy. The fetus in this case has already been evacuated, so the risk of coagulopathy has been addressed.\n(Choice E) Blaming the parent for fetal death is inappropriate under any circumstances. If actions taken by the parent possibly caused inadvertent demise of their fetus, then education should be undertaken to ensure that such a parent will have an improved chance at a successful subsequent pregnancy.\nEducational objective:\nA search should be undertaken to determine the cause after the first episode of intrauterine fetal demise. Autopsy of the fetus and placenta should be performed in all cases of stillbirth with the permission of the parents."

    "explanation": "This patient has trichomonas vaginitis, a sexually transmitted infection that causes malodorous, gray-green, thin, frothy vaginal discharge, as well as vaginal and vulvar pruritus, dysuria, and dyspareunia. Affected male partners are typically asymptomatic. On examination the vulva and vaginal walls are edematous and hyperemic. Diagnosis is made by wet-mount preparation of the discharge with visualization of the responsible organism. Trichomonas vaginalis is as a highly motile, pear-shaped organism with 3 to 5 flagella. Itis larger than WEBCs and smaller than vaginal epithelial cells. Trichomonas infection often disrupts the normal vaginal milieu, causing pH increases to the 5.0 - 6.0 range.\n(Choice A) Candida vaginitis causes a discharge that is non-malodarous, white, and thick in consistency. The pH of the discharge is usually between 4.0 and 4.5.\n{Choice C) Clue cells are vaginal epithelial cells coated with the bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. If seen on microscopic exam af vaginal discharge, this finding is diagnostic of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis may cause abnormal elevation of the vaginal pH, but pruritus and inflammation are not characteristic.\n(Choice D) Multinucleated giant cells are characteristic of genital herpes. A vesicular rash is seen an exam.\n(Choice E) Eosinophils are nat seen in Trichamanas vaginitis.\nEducational objective:\nTrichomanas infection causes inflammation, pruritus, and a thin malodorous vaginal discharge. In contrast, bacterial vaginesis does nat cause inflammation, and candida vaginitis causes a discharge that is thick and white."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Atrophic vaginitis is a clinical diagnosis made based on histary and physical exam findings. Typical symptoms include vaginal dryness, pruritus, dyspareunia, dysuria, and urinary frequency. Pelvic exam in atrophic vaginitis is characterized by pale, dry and smooth vaginal epithelium, scarce pubic hair, and loss of the labial fat pad. This condition occurs in post-menopausal females as a result of decreased estrogen levels. This patient's history and physical are typical of atrophic vaginitis. Many symptoms of atrophic vaginitis can also be seen in urinary tract infection (UTI). This patient's urine dipstick rules aut UTI, and therefore it is appropriate to proceed with treatment for atrophic vaginitis. Use of moisturizers and lubricants is an appropriate first step in management of mild atrophic vaginitis; for moderate to severe cases the first line treatment is local low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy (Choice D).\n{Choice A) Ciprofloxacin is an appropriate treatment for UTI. Many of this patient's symptoms (burning, dysuria, and urinary frequency) can be seen in UTI. However, her urine dipstick is negative, making atrophic vaginitis the mast likely diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Metronidazole is appropriate for the treatment of Trichomonas. This patient's exam does nat show findings consistent with trichamaonas, and her history is more consistent with atrophic vaginitis.\n(Choice C) Discontinuation of hydrochlorothiazide will not ameliorate the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis.\n(Choice E) Steroids have no role in the management of atrophic vaginitis, but high-potency corticosteroid cream is used in the management of vulvar lichen planus and lichen sclerosus. While these conditions may present with some of the symptoms seen in this patient, her physical exam findings and post-menopausal status are most consistent with atrophic vaginitis.\nEducational objective:\nSuspect atrophic vaginitis in post-menopausal females with symptoms of vaginal dryness and dysuria, and physical exam findings of pale, dry vaginal mucosa, diminished labial fat pad, and scarce pubic hair. Moderate and severe cases require local estrogen therapy."

    "explanation": "Alpha-fetopraotein (AFF) measurement can be used to screen for fetal anomalies. Increased levels are seen in the presence of neural tube defects, abdominal wall defects (gastroschisis, omphalocele), multiple gestation and inaccurate gestational age. Low levels of MSAFF can be associated with chromosomal anomalies, such as Down syndrome and trisomy 18, and inaccurate gestational dates. Ultrasonagraphy should first be performed in the patient described to rule out inaccurate dates. Other tests can be done after the dates have been confirmed by an ultrasound.\n(Choice A) Amniocentesis is indicated in cases where the MSAFF or triple/quadruple screen is abnarmal, but only after ultrasonography has ascertained gestational age accuracy and ruled out nonviable pregnancy ar multiple gestation. It is best performed between 16 and 20 weeks gestation.\n(Choice B) Charianic villus sampling is indicated far early screening in women with known genetic diseases ar wha have had children affected by a genetic condition. Itis performed between 10 and 12 weeks gestation, and therefore offers the advantage of a first trimester termination of pregnancy if the fetus is affected.\n(Choice D) Cordocentesis is used for rapid karyotype analysis, or when fetal blood dyscrasias, such as fetal anemia and Rhesus isoimmunization, are suspected. In the present case, ultrasound should be performed first to rule out causes of MSAFP elevation ather than genetic anomalies.\n{Choice E) An estradiol level has no clinical value in pregnancy. Serum estriol levels can be measured in pregnancy along with MSAFF and beta-hCG (triple test] as a screening tool for chromosomal anomalies in the fetus.\nEducational objective:\nIf maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFF) levels are abnarmal in a pregnant patient, the next step is ultrasonography ta confirm gestational age, detect fetal structural anomalies, detect multiple gestation and confirm a viable pregnancy."

    "explanation": "Variable decelerations represent a nan-reassuring fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern, and are characterized by the erratic onset of abrupt slowing of the FHR in association with uterine contractions. They are the most commanly encountered FHR deceleration seen in pregnancy, and are thought to be the result of umbilical card compression. Variable decelerations usually accur during the anset of uterine contractions. Mild ar moderate variable decelerations are of shart duration, shallow, and are associated with a rapid return to baseline FHR. Persistent decelerations to less than 70 beats/min and of long duration are concerning far fetal hypoxia.\nThe first step in the presence of variable decelerations is to administer oxygen and have the mother change her position so that she is lying on her side. If the variable decelerations persist, the patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg position and the presenting fetal part should be elevated. Persistent variable decelerations may require amnicinfusion, which consists of the infusion of fluid into the amniotic cavity.\n(Choice B) Rupture of the membranes will result in the loss of amniotic fluid and may warsen fetal cord Compression.\n{Choice C) Amnininfusion may be indicated if persistent variable decelerations are present, but should be used anly after mare conservative measures have failed.\n(Choice D) Fetal scalp pH testing should be performed to assess for fetal hypoxia if the abnormal FHR pattern persists after the initial measures aof position change, oxygen administration, and discontinuation of axytocin have been tried.\n(Choice E) Cesarean section is indicated when fetal distress is confirmed. The patient in this case has had anly three decelerations, and mare conservative measures should be attempted first.\nEducational objective:\nThe most appropriate first steps in the management of variable decelerations are oxygen administration and change in maternal position."

The karyotype Is the determining test, with bath androgen insensitivity and 5-alpha-reductase deficiency being seen in patients with a XY genotype. This patient's genotype is Xx, which leaves mullerian agenesis as the best explanation for her condition. The mullerian duct normally leads to the development of the proximal vagina and the uterus; therefore patients with mullerian agenesis normally have a blind ended vagina with little to no uterine tissue.\n(Choice B) Patients with androgen insensitivity have a male XY genotype but there is an abnormality in the androgen receptor. The external genitalia develop as female, but mullerian inhibiting factar is still secreted by the testes which prevents the development of internal female organs.\n(Choice C) Fatients with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency cannot convert testosterone ta the mare potent dihydrotestosterane (DHT). They have a male XY genotype and female external genitalia, but typically show virilization at puberty.\n(Choice D) An imperfarate hymen can cause primary amenorrhea but can generally be distinguished from mullerian agenesis by the distal location of the vaginal blockage. Patients have a normal uterus on ultrasound.\n(Choice E) Patients with Turner's syndrome have a xO genotype and da not have normal ovaries on ultrasound.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with mullerian agenesis have a blind ended vaginal pouch with little or no uterine tissue and a xx genotype."

Ultrasonography shows a fundic placenta and a fetus in the cephalic position. Fetal heart tracing shows 140/min with goad long-term and beat-to-beat variability. After initial resuscitation the bleeding is stopped. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Vaginal delivery with augmentation of labor, if necessary",
      "B. Emergency cesarean section",
      "C. Perform tocolysis and schedule cesarean section within 48 hours",
      "D. Forceps delivery",
      "E. Conservative management at home"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "According ta the clinical signs and the associated pre-eclampsia, the patient most likely has a placental abruption. Ultrasonography detects only 25% of cases of abruption, and it is mare useful in ruling out placenta previa than in diagnosing abruption. Placental abruption is a condition that can progress rapidly; so careful monitoring of both the mother and the fetus is mandatory. Once the diagnosis is made, a large-baore IV line as well as a Foley catheter must be placed. Blood products should always be available. Patients with placental abruption in labar must be managed aggressively to insure a rapid vaginal delivery because this will remave the retroplacental hemorrhage which acts as the impetus for DIC and hemarrhage in the setting of placental abruption. Cesarean section is used only when there are obstetric indications for that procedure ar when there is a rapid deterioration of the state of either the mother or the fetus. In this case, the patient is stable, the fetus is at term and doing well, and labor has already started (presence of cervical changes), so a vaginal delivery can be attempted and oxytocin can be used ta augment labor.\n(Choices B & C) Cesarean section is indicated if the mother and/or the fetus are not stable, and the risk of serious complications is imminent, or in the case of obstetrical contraindications to vaginal delivery (placenta previa, dystocia, breech presentation, prior caesarian). Furthermore, delivery in this case should be expedited; there is no reason to perform tocalysis.\n(Choice D) Forceps can be used if there is dystocia, but the cervix is only 3 cm dilated and it is too early to know whether the forceps will be necessary or not.\n(Choice E) Because the fetus is at term and labor is progressing, there is no reason to wait. Additionally, because of the maternal and fetal mortality associated with placental abruption, the patient described must be managed immediately.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with placental abruption in labor must be managed aggressively to insure a rapid vaginal delivery. Cesarean section is used only when there are obstetric indications, or when there is a rapid deteriaration of the state of either the mather ar the fetus and labar is in an early stage."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Smoking is the single most prevalent preventable cause of FGR in the United States. One in three cases of FGR is attributable to smoking, and women who smoke while pregnant have a three to four-fold increased risk of having a growth restricted infant.\n(Choice A) Smoking is much mare common during pregnancy than is alcoholism. Significant alcohal consumption during pregnancy is associated with the fetal alcohol syndrome, which is characterized by growth restriction accompanied by midfacial hypoplasia and CNS deficits.\n{Choice C) Maternal malnutrition must be severe in order to produce fetal growth restriction; this is not commanly observed in the United States.\n(Choice D) Hypertension is a prevalent cause of fetal growth restriction, but it is not as commonly associated with FGR as is smoking. Hypertension in pregnancy is not only associated with FGR, but it is also associated with severe conditions that pose risk to the mother such as preeclampsia and eclampsia.\n(Choice E) The most commonly identified infectious agent associated with FGR is cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can not be effectively prevented ar treated in most cases.\nEducational objective:\nCigarette smoking is the most common preventable cause of fetal growth restriction in the United States."

    "question": "A 20-year-old, G1P0, woman at 35 weeks gestation comes to the hospital because of regular uterine contractions and passage of clear fluid per vagina. She has no other symptoms. Her pregnancy thus far has been uncomplicated. Her temperature is 38.2 C (100.7 F), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 110/min and respirations are 17/min. Speculum examination shows a closed cervix and clear fluid pooling in the vaginal farnix. The pH of the fluid is 7.5. Fetal heart monitoring shows a rate of 165/min and uterine cantractions occurring every 3-4 minutes. Initial laboratory studies show: Hemoglokin 10.2 g/L, Platelets 198,000/mm3, Leukocyte count 18,500/mm3, Neutrophils 86%, Lymphocytes 14%. Which of the following is the mast likely diagnasis?",

      "C. Urinary tract infection",
      "D. Trichomonas vaginitis",
      "E. Marmal labor"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has experienced spontaneous premature rupture of the membranes (FROM), which is defined as a rupture of the amniotic membranes before 37 weeks of gestation but with the onset of labor, as evidenced by her regular uterine contractions. Normal amniatic fluid pH is 7.0 to 7.5, while normal vaginal pH is 4.5 to 5.5, so the more neutral pH of the fluid described in this patient indicates it is of amniatic arigin. One af the risks associated with PPROM is intraamniotic infection. Intraamnictic infection (chorioamnionitis) should be suspected in mathers presenting with prolonged or premature rupture of the membranes, fever and any one of the following findings: maternal tachycardia (= 100/min), fetal tachycardia (= 160/min), maternal leukocytasis (= 15,000/mm3), uterine tenderness or foul-smelling amniotic fluid.\n(Choice A) Abruptio placenta commanly presents with bleeding from the vagina: though, a subset of placental abruptions is concealed and does not cause clinical bleeding. Abdominal ar back pain, uterine tenderness and abnormal uterine contractions are typical. Fetal distress due to poor placental perfusion may be evident.\n(Choice C) A urinary tract infection may cause leukocytosis if the infection was ascending. Dysuria would likely be present and fetal tachycardia would not be expected.\n(Choice D) Trichomonas vaginitis is not associated with obstetric complications other than a possible association with early labor.\n{Choice E) Maternal leukocytosis (=15 000/cmm) with fever and fetal tachycardia are not components of normal labar.\nEducational objective:\nIntraamnictic infection should be suspected in the setting of prolonged or premature rupture of the membranes when maternal fever, leukocytosis, uterine tenderness or tachycardia is detected. Fetal tachycardia is anather feature of charicamnianitis."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient described has experienced spontaneous preterm rupture of the membranes (FROM) that has been complicated by an intraamniatic infection {charioamnianitis). The mast impartant first intervention is treatment of the mather with broad spectrum antibiotics as chorioamnianitis is frequently a palymicrobial infection. The preferred regimen includes a combination of intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin. Concomitantly with the administration of antibiotics delivery of the fetus should be expedited as the fetus in question is near term (35 weeks gestation) and the amniotic membrane has ruptured. The most appropriate means of expediting labor in this case would be administration of oxytocin as the patient is already experiencing regular uterine contractions and appears to be in the first stage of labor.\n(Choice A) Tocolysis would be contraindicated in this setting.\n(Choice B) Betamethasone administered in an effort to imprave fetal lung maturity would have little benefit beyond 32-34 weeks gestational age.\n(Choice C) While delivery should be expedited in this case, caesarean section should be reserved for cases where fetal distress is evident. Fetal tachycardia is a sign of maternal infection.\n(Choice E) Expectant management may be attempted if a fetus is not yet viable pravided antibiotic therapy is successful in eradicating the infection. Once the membranes have ruptured, however, delivery typically follows.\nEducational objective:\nThe most appropriate treatment of charioamnionitis associated with premature rupture of the membranes is systemic, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and expedited delivery of the fetus."

      "D. Stop enalapril and start losartan",
      "E. Continue current therapy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This pregnant female has essential hypertension which preceded pregnancy. The guidelines far essential hypertension during pregnancy recommend that ACE-inhibitars and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) be discontinued. Both ACE-inhibitars and ARBs are teratogenic throughout the pregnancy, increasing the risk of aligghydramnios and damage to fetal kidneys. Recommended anti-hypertensives during pregnancy include labetalal and methyldopa. Therefore, in this patient, enalapril should be replaced with labetalol. In pregnant females with essential hypertension and BF <=120/80, it is appropriate to consider tapering or discontinuing all anti-hypertensives. Far BF above this value, continuation of anti-hypertensive therapy is appropriate. If a pregnant patient presents with essential hypertension and is not currently on anti-hypertensives it is anly necessary to begin anti-hypertensive therapy if the BP is consistently above 150 systolic or 95 diastolic.\n(Choice A) While discontinuing enalapril is appropriate, replacement with furosemide is nat. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is not amongst the first-line agents for management of essential hypertension in pregnant ar non-pregnant patients. Also, volume depletion should be avoided in pregnant patients.\n(Choices B, D & E) Losartan is an ARB. Both ACE-inhibitors and AREs have been shown to have teratogenic effects and should be avoided in pregnancy. Therefare, initiating losartan ar continuing current therapy are both inappropriate.\nEducational objective:\nACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy. The first-line agents for management of essential hypertension during pregnancy are labetalal and methyldopa."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "During pregnancy the primary goal of colposcopy is the exclusion af invasive cervical cancer. The management of any woman with a cytologic specimen suggesting HSIL consists of colposcopy and directed biopsy. Amang women with HSIL cytology results, 1-2% harbar invasive cancer. The patient alsa has the presence of an ancogenic strain of HPY and is therefore considered an especially high risk patient. If the initial biopsy is negative, a repeat colposcopy and biopsy should be done at 6-8 weeks after delivery.\n{Choice A) LEER procedure is an excisional therapy and is recommended for all patients except adolescents and pregnant woman with HSIL on Pap smear but without CIM Il or greater on biopsy since the abnormal area may have been missed by the biopsy. Excisions in pregnant women should be considered only if a lesion suggestive of invasive cancer is detected at colposcopy.\n{Choice B) Repeating the Pap smear will not change management of the patient; a repeat colposcopy is still required after delivery.\n(Choice C) There is no indication for termination of pregnancy with an abnarmal pap smear.\n(Choice E) Endocervical curettage is contraindicated in pregnant patients.\nEducational objective:\nDuring pregnancy, the primary goal of colposcopy is the exclusion of invasive cancer. Any woman with a cytologic specimen suggesting HSIL should undergo colposcopy and directed biopsy. If the biopsy is negative, a second biopsy is recommended 6-8 weeks after delivery."

    "options": [
      "A. Repeat Pap smear in 2 weeks",

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL)\n(Mild dysplasia (or) CIN 1)\nAdolescents -> Repeat Pap in 12 months\nPremenopausal woman -> Colposcopy\nPostmenopausal woman -> Reflex HPV testing -> (If ‘positive’) Colposcopy\nThe management of a low-grade squamous epithelial lesion (LSIL) differs based on the age of the patient. In general, LSIL discovered on cervical cytology indicates the presence of cytologically atypical squamous cells an the cervix. The atypicality of these cells may be due to HPV infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIN is graded as type 1 —3. The majarity of LSIL lesions nat attributable simply to HPV infection are CIN 1, which does not require treatment, anly observation. Uncommanly, LSIL may be observed in the setting of CIN 2 or 3, which require treatment. In a nonadolescent, premenopausal woman, LSIL should be followed by colposcopy in order to biopsy the lesion and rule out CIN 2 or 3.\n(Choice A) Repeat Pap smear in 2 weeks is not a routine method used to follow-up an abnormal Pap smear.\n(Choice B) Repeating the Fap smear in 12 manths is appropriate in the setting of a normal Pap smear, a smear revealing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and LSIL in adolescent females or high-risk HP'/-neqgative postmenopausal females. The risk of cancer is very low in adolescent woman and the LSIL is most often due to transient HPV infection. If a repeat Pap (after 12 months) is also abnormal then the colposcopy should be performed.\n(Choice C) Reflex HPV testing should be carried out in postmenopausal women with LSIL, and if positive, should be followed by colposcopy. HPY testing is most commonly positive in premenapausal wamen; therefore, it does not decrease the frequency of colposcopy referrals and is of little use as the initial test for LSIL evaluation. Postmenopausal woman are unlikely to have transient HPY infection.\n(Choice D) Cone biopsy (conization) can be accomplished by cold knife, laser or electrosurgical techniques. This procedure is used ta treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The benefit of this treatment modality is that it allows histologic evaluation of the entire cervical transformation zone.\nEducational objective:\nCervical dysplasia in a high risk (post-adolescent, premenopausal) patient should be investigated with colposcopy."

Patients with endometriosis may frequently be asymptomatic, but when symptoms are present, they typically include chronic pelvic pain that is warse in the premenstrual period, dysmenarrhea and pain with sexual intercourse ar defecation. Examination may reveal rectovaginal tenderness ar tenderness with movement of the uterus due to the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue in the rectovaginal septum and the pelvic peritoneum, anteriar and posterior cul-de-sac and uterosacral ligaments. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for making the diagnosis of endometriosis.\n(Choice A) Endometrial biopsy is used to diagnosis endometrial cancer. As endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, a biopsy from within the uterus will not be able to make the diagnosis.\n{Choice C) CA 125 is elevated in endometriosis and levels tend to correlate with the severity of endometriosis, but it is an inadequate tool far making the diagnosis of endometriosis as it has a poor sensitivity.\n(Choice D) A hysterosalpingogram will fail to detect endometriosis because this study explores the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes but will give no information about the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus.\n{Choice E) There is no known association between beta hCG levels and endometriosis. Serial hCG levels are performed in malar pregnancy ta prove that a mole or choriocarcinama has been completely eliminated fallawing surgical evacuation of the uterus.\n(Choice F) CT scanning is unable to sufficiently distinguish between soft tissues to make the diagnosis of endometriosis. Similarly, ultrasound is an inadequate tool for making the diagnosis of endometriosis as itis unable to reliably demonstrate endometriomas and adhesions caused by endometriosis. MRI with contrast may have some merit.\nEducational objective:\nLaparoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis."

Up to 30% of females being evaluated far infertility are found to have endometriosis. Possible mechanisms for impaired fertility in these patients include adhesion formation within the peritoneum that interferes with the normal transfer of oocytes from the ovarian surface to the fallopian tubes, endometrial factors within the uterus that may provide a suboptimal environment far implantation and hormanal issues that have yet to be determined that may affect avarian function.\n(Choice A) Risk factors for endometrial carcinoma include advancing age, use of unopposed estrogen in the past, prolonged use of tamaxifen, obesity, nulliparity and polycystic ovarian syndrome (Stein-Leventhal syndrome).\n(Choice B) Risk factors for breast cancer include a positive family history, mutations in BRCAT, BRCAZ or p53, early menarche, late menopause, prolonged hormone replacement therapy, nulliparity and uncomman genetic diseases such as Cowden syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia.\n(Choice D) Patients at increased risk of abruptio placenta include those with hypertension, cocaine users, smakers, those of advancing age and patients with preeclampsia.\n(Choice E) Risk factars far preterm labar include priar preterm labor, multiple gestation, premature rupture of the membranes and exposure ta diethylstilbestral.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with endometriosis are at an increased risk of decreased fertility or infertility.

      "D. Suppression of ovulation by human placental lactogen",
      "E. Physiologic postpartum endometrial atrophy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The amenorrhea that occurs in lactating mothers is the result of high levels of circulating prolactin, which have an inhibitory effect on the production of the hypothalamic hormone GnRH. Fulsatile GnRH release from the hypothalamus is necessary for the production and release of LH and FSH by the anterior pituitary. LH and FSH are required to induce ovulation; menses do not occur when ovulation is suppressed in this manner. Because lactation suppresses ovulation, it is used as a contraceptive method, but it is not considered a reliable method of birth control. In fact, 50% of nursing mathers ovulate within 6 to 12 months of delivery.\n{Choice A) Placental estrogens inhibit gonadotropin secretion during pregnancy, but as soon as the placenta is evacuated their levels quickly drop.\n(Choice C) Oxytocin has no effect an the endometrium. It has an effect on the uterine muscle and plays an important role in uterine involution in the postpartum period. Oxytocin levels are elevated during lactation as this hormane also stimulates the expulsion of milk from the lactiferaus glands.\n(Choice D) Human placental lactogen (hPL) is produced by the placenta, and serum levels quickly decrease after delivery of the placenta. hPL has an insulin antagonist effect and plays an important role in nutrition of the fetus by causing maternal lipolysis and insulin resistance thus increasing delivery of fatty acids and glucose ta the fetus.\n(Choice E) There is no physiologic endometrial atrophy in the postpartum period. The endometrium proliferates normally as soon as estrogen levels rise and the first ovulation occurs.\nEducational objective:\nElevated prolactin levels suppress GnRH release thereby suppressing LH and FSH production and avulation. This is the reason for anavulation and amenarrhea in lactating mothers."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has a positive pregnancy test but no evidence of an intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy. The differential includes early viable intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or nanviable intrauterine pregnancy (completed abortion). Serial B-HCG levels are usually required when the results of the initial ultrasonography examination are indeterminate. B-HCG should generally double about every 48 hours in viable pregnancies, but increases at a slower rate in ectopic and nonviable intrauterine pregnancies. An intrauterine pregnancy should be seen with transvaginal ultrasonography at levels from 1500-2000 mIU/mL. One would not expect to see an intrauterine pregnancy with a B-HCG level of 1,000 mIU/mL. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a nonsurgical abdomen. It is safe in her case to repeat the B-HCG levels in 48 hours. Once the B-HCG level is above 1500 mIU/mL a repeat transvaginal ultrasound should be performed.\n(Choice A) Even though laparoscapy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy, it is rarely required for diagnastic purposes as B-HCG and transvaginal ultrasound are usually sufficient far diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Methotrexate is sometimes used for the medical management of a nonruptured ectopic pregnancy, but the diagnosis must first be canfirmed because it is still possible that this patient has a viable intrauterine pregnancy.\n(Choice D) Anti-D immune globulin (RhoGAM) is used in Rh negative patients ta prevent hemalytic disease af the newborn in future pregnancies. This patient is Rh factar positive and therefore does nat warrant Anti-0 immune globulin.\n(Choice E) Dilatation and curettage is performed when the pregnancy has been confirmed to be nonviable via serial B-hCG measurements and the location of the pregnancy cannot be determined by ultrasonography. This decision must be made with caution so as not to interrupt a viable intrauterine pregnancy. ltis essential to confirm the presence of trophoblastic tissue in the specimen.\nEducational objective:\nAn intrauterine pregnancy should be seen with transvaginal ultrasonography at B-HCG levels of 1500-2000 mIU/mL. If the level is <1,000 miU/ml, both P-HCG and transvaginal ultrasonography should be repeated in 2-3 days."

The current recommendations for cervical cancer screening with a Pap smear state that screening should be initiated in all women three years after initiation of sexual intercourse but na later than 21 years of age.\n(Choices A & B) Combined oral contraceptive pills are not associated with weight gain, so stopping these pills will only serve to increase this patient's chance of becoming pregnant. Additionally, a Pap smear is nat yet indicated for screening this patient for cervical dysplasia because she has only recently begun sexual activity. She should have her first Fap smear at 21 years of age.\n(Choice D) Weight gain has been reparted in assaciation with medroxyprogesterone use, and weight gain is listed as one of the adverse effects of this drug, but controlled studies have not been done to substantiate this effect.\nEducational objective:\nWeight gain has not been associated with the use of combination aral contraceptive pills in controlled studies."

    "explanation": "The patient described is suffering fram severe preeclampsia, which is characterized by hypertension (= 160/110), proteinuria (= 5g on 24h urine), oliguria, pulmanary edema, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. These signs are alsa part of the HELLP (hypertension, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome. Preeclampsia has effects on multiple argan systems. The liver can be involved in preeclampsia by centrilobular necrosis, hematoma formation and the formation of thrombi in the partal capillary system. These processes can cause swelling of the liver with distention of the hepatic (Glisson's) capsule and resultant right upper quadrant pain as the peritoneum is innervated by somatic nerves that pravide localized sensation of pain.\n(Choices A & B) Obstruction of the common bile duct and cystic duct would cause right upper quadrant pain, fever and jaundice.\n{Choice C) Symptoms of acute viral hepatitis include anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and jaundice.\n(Choice D) Peptic ulcer disease causes episodic gnawing epigastric pain associated with the sensation of gastric regurgitation and, occasionally, with bleeding (hematemesis or melena).\n(Choice E) Rupture of a hepatic adenoma can occur during pregnancy. Rupture of such an adenoma would result in peritonitis (tenderness and rebound) and fluid resuscitation would be required.\nEducational objective:\nOne of the effects of preeclampsia is damage ta the liver that can cause right upper quadrant pain due to stretching of the hepatic (Glissan's) capsule."

    "explanation": "Prolonged (postterm) pregnancy is defined as any pregnancy at or beyond 42 weeks gestational age measured form the last menstrual period. Fostterm pregnancy can be managed with either induction of labor ar close twice weekly assessment of fetal well being. Patients with an unfavorable cervix are typically managed expectantly while those with a favorable cervix are managed with induction. Biweekly monitoring with ultrasonography is required to evaluate far oligghydramnios in postterm pregnancies because amniotic fluid can become drastically reduced within 24 ta 48 hours. Oligohydramnios in these cases is defined as no vertical pocket of amniotic fluid greater than 2 cm or an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm ar less.\n{Choice A) Polyhydramnios is associated with congenital fetal malformations. The mast commanly associated malformations are those of the Gl tract and CNS.\n(Choice C) Risk factors for abruptio placenta include uncontrolled maternal hypertension, maternal cocaine use and a history of prior episodes of placental abruption.\n(Choice D) Risk factors for placenta previa include advancing maternal age, multiparty, multiple gestations, smaking and prior caesarian section.\n(Choice E) Preeclampsia risk factors are numerous. Some risk factors include extremes of maternal age, diabetes, renal diseases, collagen vascular diseases, baseline uncontrolled maternal hypertension and a family history of preeclampsia.\nEducational objective:\nFostterm pregnancies are at an increased risk for oligahydramnias, which itself is associated with increased fetal morbidity.

    "question": "A 24-year-old female presents to you for the evaluation of acne. Further questioning, reveals that she also has had irregular periods far a long time. She is single and not sexually active. On examination, her BMI is 31 Kg/m2 and she has evidence of hirsutism. Further evaluation reveals increase in serum free testosterone and LH/F SH ratio of 24. Glucose tolerance testing reveals two-hour blood glucose of 155 mg/dL. Apart from prescribing aral contraceptive pills, which of the following is indicated in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Clomiphene citrate",
      "B. Metformin",
      "C. Insulin",
      "D. Glipizide",
      "E. Mao other medication needed"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's history of abnormal menstrual periods and hirsutism in the form of acne points towards polycystic avarian syndrome (PCOS). The elevated testosterone level and increased LH/F SH ratio are bath consistent with the diagnosis as well. Type Il diabetes and impaired glucase tolerance are common findings in patients with FCOS. A glucose tolerance test is recommended in all patients diagnosed with FCOS as it is mare sensitive in detecting abnormal glucose metabalism than a fasting glucose. A two-hour glucose of >=140 mg/dL on glucose tolerance test is presumptive of insulin resistance and >=200 is consistent with diabetes mellitus. Life style modification, oral contraceptive ar clomiphene (depending an desire to conceive), and antiandrogen agents may be used as treatment. In addition, metformin is indicated in women with polycystic avarian syndrome and impaired glucose tolerance. The benefits of metformin use in polycystic avarian syndrome are as follows:\n1. It helps prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n2. Helps losing weight (most of the patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome are obese).\n3. In conjugation with clomiphene citrate, it helps to induce ovulation in infertile palycystic ovarian syndrome patients with anovulation; however, it is not FDA approved to be used just for this purpose.\n4. It has modest effect in suppressing androgen praduction and, thus, helps correct hirsutism to some extent.\n(Choice A) Clomiphene citrate is used to induce ovulation in polycystic ovarian syndrome patient with infertility. However, this patient is single and has nat expressed any wish to bear children, sa it is nat indicated at this point.\n(Choice C & D) Metformin is the initial drug of choice for impaired glucose tolerance in diabetes mellitus because of its additional beneficial effects aside fram glucose metabalism.\n(Choice E) This patient has impaired glucose tolerance and is at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus; thus, she needs metformin treatment.\nEducational objective:\nMetformin is indicated in polycystic avarian syndrome patients with impaired glucose tolerance. It helps in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as improving obesity, hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, and infertility"

    "question": "A 21-year-old woman at 36 weeks gestation is admitted for delivery. She has severe preeclampsia. Her blood pressure is 190/110 mmHg, pulse is B0/min and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination shows 3+ pitting edema of the legs and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Fundoscopic examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show elevated BUN, serum creatinine and serum transaminases. Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria. Intravenous hydralazine and magnesium sulfate was initiated on admission. After stabilization, intravenous oxytocin and artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) was administered for induction of labar. Two hours later, her blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg, pulse is 78/min and respirations are 9/min. Repeat examination shows hyporeflexia and a completely effaced cervix that is 5 cm dilated.

      "D. Stop intravenous oxytocin and intubate the patient",
      "E. Continue current treatment and proceed with delivery"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The second neuralogic exam performed in this patient shows depressed deep tendon reflexes, which is the earliest sign of magnesium sulfate toxicity. Magnesium causes toxicity by acting as a CNS depressant and by blocking neuromuscular transmission. It is very important for patients an magnesium sulfate to be closely abserved with regular examination of their deep tendon reflexes. The secand sign of toxicity is respiratory depression. The treatment of magnesium sulfate toxicity Is immediate discontinuation of the infusion and administration of calcium gluconate.\n(Choice A) There is no need to stap hydralazine as her BP is stable. Stopping hydralazine would be indicated if the BF dropped abruptly.\n(Choice C) Monitoring a cyanide level is irrelevant because the patient is not being treated with nitroprusside.\n(Choice D) The patient may necessitate artificial ventilation due to respiratory depression related to magnesium toxicity, but stopping magnesium sulfate and administration of calcium gluconate is the mare urgent intervention. Oxytocin is not responsible far her condition; it is analogous ta ADH and therefore, may be responsible for hyponatremia and water intoxication.\n(Choice E) If magnesium sulfate infusion is nat stopped immediately there is a risk of death due to cardiac ar respiratory arrest.\nEducational objective:\nDepressian of the deep tendon reflexes is the earliest sign of magnesium sulfate toxicity. Treatment requires stopping the magnesium sulfate infusion and administration of calcium gluconate."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Gonarrhea is the second most common communicable disease in the United States. tis a major cause of urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatary disease. Cervicitis is most common in females, but up to 50% af infected women are asymptomatic. Since gram stain cannot identify Chlamydia and coinfection is comman, simultaneous treatment to eradicate bath organisms is indicated. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment of gonococcal infection. A single dose of azithromycin or a 10-day course of doxycycline is commanly used to treat chlamydial infection.\n(Choice A) While doxycycline is effective for the treatment of chlamydial infection, penicillin is a poor choice for treatment of Ganarrhea due ta resistance.\n(Choice B) Ceftriaxone would effectively treat Ganarrhea, but not Chlamydia. Treating both conditions simultaneously is imperative given the high incidence of co-infection.\n(Choice D) Ceftriaxone would cover Gonorrhea, but metronidazole would not treat Chlamydia. Metronidazale is used for bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas infectian.\n(Choice E) Ampicillin and gentamicin is indicated if there is a suspicion far palymicrobial infection such as postpartum endometritis.\nEducational objective:\nGiven the high rate of co-infection with Gonorrhea and Chlamydia and the poor sensitivity of gram stain far Chlamydia, antibiotic management must be aimed at eradication of both organisms when gram stain confirms cervical Gonorrhea infection."

    "question": "A 22-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital for delivery. She has had regular and painful uterine contractions occurring every 3 minutes for the past 10 hours. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She had a narmal vaginal delivery far her first pregnancy and required an episiotomy. A recent ultrasound at 37 weeks gestation showed a fetus in a cephalic presentation with an estimated fetal weight of 3400 g (7.5lb). Examination shows the cervix is soft, 50% effaced and 2 cm dilated. She is given epidural anesthesia per her request. Eight hours later, her cervix has not significantly changed, and uterine cantractions are occurring every 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cephalopelvic dispropartion",
      "B. Early anesthesia",
      "C. Cervical dysfunction",
      "D. Perineal scar",
      "E. False labor"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Onset of labor\n| Latent phase\n2 cm cervical dilatation } First stage\n| Active phase\n10 em (full) cervical dilatation\n| Second slage\nDelivery of the infant\n| Third stage\nExpulsion of the placenta\nThis patient is experiencing a prolonged latent phase. The length of the latent phase is highly variable but is considered prolonged when it exceeds 20 hours in primiparous women and 14 hours in multiparous women. A prolonged latent phase can be caused by hypotonic uterine contractions, uncoordinated uterine contractions, fetopelvic disproportion, ar premature or excessive use of anesthesia or sedation. Hypotanic contractions are less painful and are characterized by an easily indentable uterus during the contraction. Anesthesia may reduce uterine activity if administered in the latent phase as in the patient described. Inthe active phase, spinal anesthesia has no significant effect on the progression of labor. The anly treatment for labor prolongation resulting from anesthesia or sedation is to allow the responsible drug to be eliminated; the uterus usually resumes its normal activity afterwards. Patients with hypocontractile dysfunction are best treated with a diluted infusion of oxytocin.\n(Choice A) Cephalopelvic (fetopelvic) disproportion is unlikely because on the one hand the fetus has an average estimated weight, and on the other the pelvis has been tested by a prior delivery. An episiotomy is frequently required in narmal primiparous women; the performance of an episiotomy with her previous delivery does not indicate cephalopelvic dispropartion.\n(Choice C) Cervical dysfunction is usually seen in patients wha have had prior cervical surgery, so itis unlikely to be the cause of this patient's anomaly. The cervix in this case is soft, dilated and effaced — all of these signs indicate a cervix responding appropriately to early labar.\n(Choice D) The fetus in this case is still high in the pelvis and would therefore not be in contact with an episiotomy scar. Moreover, an episiotomy scar is not likely to cause dystocia.\n(Choice E) False labor is not accompanied by cervical changes. Contractions in false labor are sporadic, not painful and occur at long intervals.\nEducational objective:\nBath general and spinal anesthesia as well as sedation may reduce uterine activity if administered in the latent phase thus prolonging this stage of labar."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The increase in blood pressure in this case appeared before 20-weeks gestation and thus represents either chronic hypertension that was present before pregnancy or a hydatiform mole. Ultrasound demonstrated a normal gestational sac, so a malar pregnancy can be safely ruled out. The work-up revealed hypernatremia and hypokalemia, which indicates hyperaldosteronism. Patients with chronic hypertension should be carefully followed; if proteinuria or a significant increase in BF is noted as the pregnancy progresses, chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia is diagnosed.\n(Choice A) This patient is hypertensive but does not have non-dependant edema ar proteinuria, sao the diagnosis of preeclampsia cannat be made.

The patient described has chronic hypertension, and risk factors for placental abruption include priar placental abruption, chronic hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension, cocaine, alcohol ar tobacco use and vascular diseases such as diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. The mast significant risk factar is hypertension of any kind. Sustained maternal blood pressures in excess of 160/110 should be treated pharmacologically.\n(Choice A) Uncontrolled maternal diabetes is an important and comman cause of fetal macrosomia. Uncontrolled HTN causes fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios.\n(Choice B) Risk factors for placenta previa include prior caesarian delivery, multiparity, multiple gestation and advanced maternal age.\n(Choice D) Uterine atony is associated with Fostterm hemarrhage. Conditions that result in excessive uterine distention such as multiple gestation ar polyhydramnios predispose ta this condition.\n(Choice E) Postterm pregnancy occurs in women with prior postpartum pregnancies and in those whose mathers experienced repeated Postterm pregnancies.

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of vomiting that complicates approximately 1% of pregnancies. In hyperemesis gravidarum, vomiting usually begins between weeks 4 and 10. While hyperemesis gravidarum can be managed successfully with supportive therapy (fluids and nutrition) and generally resolves on its own by mid-pregnancy, other causes of severe vomiting during pregnancy must be considered. Gestational trophablastic disease (hydatidiform male and choriocarcinama) is one disease to consider in such cases. The classical clinical triad for a hydatidiformn mole is: enlarged uterus, hyperemesis, and markedly elevated beta HCG (> 100,000). Thus, measurement of quantitative beta HCG is an appropriate initial diagnostic step in the evaluation of severe vomiting during pregnancy. If the beta HCG level is markedly elevated an ultrasonogram should then be performed.\n(Choice A) Upper Gl endoscopy is nat indicated at this juncture. Upper endoscopy may be considered in any case of severe nausea and vamiting in which history, physical exam, and initial laboratory testing do not reveal a likely source.\n{Choice B) When gestational trophoblastic disease is suspected, measurement of quantitative beta HCG is indicated. Ultrasonagram is then performed if the beta HCG level is greater than expected.\n(Choice C) CT of the head would be useful if a space occupying lesion were suspected as a cause of vomiting. This is very unlikely withaut other neuralagical findings.\n{Choice D) A right upper quadrant ultrasound would be useful if the patient had right upper quadrant pain. Pregnant patients are at increased risk for cholecystitis.\nEducational objective:\nGestational trophoblastic disease should be ruled out in pregnant patients with severe vomiting.

Ascension of periurethral bacteria is the most common cause of UTl's. Since wamen have sharter urethras, they are more predisposed to UTl's than men.\nSexual intercourse is an important risk factar for the development of uncomplicated UT's in women because it introduces bacteria into the bladder via a mechanical effect. This can be prevented most effectively by voiding after intercourse, which promotes the clearance of bacteria introduced during intercourse, thus reducing the risk of cystitis.\n(Choice A) Spermicide-cantaining contraceptives have been shown to significantly increase the risk of urinary tract infections.\n(Choice B) Spermicidal jelly may result in the alteration of the vaginal environment, resulting in an increased risk of UTl's. Condom use may protect against contracting certain STD's, but will not decrease the risk of UTl.\n{Choice C) Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated ta prevent UT's unless women have had twa or mare symptomatic UTI's within the last six months.\n(Choice E) Sexual intercourse is ane of the mast important risk factars for the development of UTI's in wamen.\nEducational objective:\nVoiding after intercourse has been shown to decrease the risk of urinary tract infections in sexually-active females."

She had an abortion at an outside clinic 3 days ago. Her temperature is 39.8C (103.7F), blood pressure is 100/65mmHg, pulse is 114/min and respirations are 26/min. Physical examination shaws mild rigidity and guarding. Fundal height is at 12 weeks gestation, the adnexae are free and na mass is noted. Bimanual examination shows uterine tenderness with purulent, offensive vaginal discharge coming out of a dilated cervical os. Which of the following is the most appropriate sequence in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cervical and blood cultures, antibiotics, vigorous and thorough curettage",
      "B. Cervical and blood cultures, antibiotics, gentle suction curettage",
      "C. Antibiotics, suction curettage, cervical and blood sampling",
      "D. Cervical and blood cultures, antibiotics and close observation",
      "E. Laparotomy and antibiotics"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Septic abortion can result from infection of retained products of conception in the case of missed, incomplete, inevitable or elective abortions. This condition is clinically characterized by fever chills, abdominal pain and a bloody / purulent vaginal discharge. Examination shows lower abdominal tenderness and an enlarged, tender uterus with a dilated cervix. Septic abortion is a medical emergency. Broad spectrum antibiotics are given immediately after obtaining the blood and cervical / endometrial cultures. Immediate surgical evacuation of the uterine contents is then required in arder ta remove the infectious nidus. This is best done with gentle suction curettage. Vigorous curettage should be avoided because of the risk of uterine perforation.\n(Choice C) Cervical and blood sampling should be done prior to the administration of antibiotics and suction curettage.\n(Choice D) Cervical and blood cultures and antibiotics are indicated, but evacuation of the infected intrauterine products of conception is required ta resolve the infection in much the same way that an abscess must be drained in order to resolve.\n{Choice E) Laparotomy and antibiotics may be indicated if antibiotics and suction curettage are not sufficient to resolve the infection.\nEducational objective:\nSeptic abortion is managed with cervical and blood cultures followed by IV antibiotics and gentle suction curettage. Vigorous suction curettage may cause perforation of the uterus and should be avoided."

    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of a seven-week history of amenorrhea. She also states that she has had nausea and vomiting far five weeks. She is sexually active. Her medical and obstetrical histories are unremarkable. Serum hCG level is elevated. Which of the following is the most important role of hCG in pregnancy?",
    "options": [
      "A. Inhibition of uterine contractions",
      "B. Induction of prolactin production by the pituitary",
      "C. Promotion and maintenance of implantation",
      "D. Maintenance of the corpus luteum",
      "E. Induction of early embryonic division and differentiation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a harmone secreted by the syncytiotraphoblast and is responsible for preserving the corpus luteum during early pregnancy in order to maintain progesterone secretion until the placenta is able to produce progesterone an its own. Production of hCG begins about eight days after fertilization, and the levels of hCG double every 48 hours until they peak at six to eight weeks gestation. The hCG is composed of two subunits: alpha and beta. The alpha subunit is comman to hCG, TSH, LH, and FSH. The beta subunit is specific to hCG, and is used as the basis of virtually all pregnancy tests.\nOther biological functions of hCG include the promation of male sexual differentiation and stimulation of the maternal thyroid gland.\n(Choice A) Progesterone is produced in large amounts during pregnancy, and helps to inhibit uterine contractions.\n(Choice B) Estrogen, not hCG, is the harmone responsible for induction of prolactin production during pregnancy.\n{Choice C) Progesterone is the hormone respansible for preparing the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum, not hCG.\n(Choice E) Division of the fertilized egg begins before implantation, and occurs days before hCG secretion begins.\nEducational objective:\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone secreted by the syncytiotraphoblast and is mainly responsible far the preservation of the carpus luteum in early pregnancy."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 30 weeks' gestation comes to the physician because of a decrease in fetal movements. She has felt no fetal movements the past 18-hours. Her prenatal course, prenatal tests, and fetal growth have been normal up to this point. Triple test was performed at 14-weeks and showed no abnormalities. Her first pregnancy was terminated because her fetus was diagnosed with Down's syndrome. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Fetal heart tones are heard by Doppler. Mon-stress test is non-reactive; therefore, biophysical profile is performed and shows a score of 8. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Reassurance and repeat biophysical profile in ane week",
      "B. Perform contraction stress test",
      "C. Give steroids and repeat biophysical profile with in 24 hrs",
      "D. Advise continuous home fetal monitaring",
      "E. Deliver the baby immediately"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Biophysical profile (BPP) is a scoring system designed to evaluate fetal well being. It is indicated in high risk pregnancies, ar in case of maternal or physician concern, decreased fetal movements, or a nan-reactive MST. It includes the NST in addition to four parameters assessed by ultrasonography: 1/Fetal tane; 2/fetal movements (3/10min); 3/fetal breathing (30/10 min); 4/amniotic fluid index, (5-20). Each of these five variables is given a score of two when present, and a score of zero when absent or abnormal. A total scare af 8-10 is considered normal, and should only be repeated once ar twice weekly until term for high risk pregnancies.\n1. In the presence of aligahydramnios {AFI <=5) delivery is to be cansidered since it can result in umbilical cord compression and therefore fetal compromise.\n2. If the scare is 6 without aligohydramnios, contraction stress test should be ordered. If this latter gives nan-reassuring results, delivery is usually indicated; if it gives suspicious results, repeat the next day.\n3. If the scare is 4 without aligohydramnios and fetal lungs are mature, delivery should be considered. If fetal lungs have nat yet reached their maturity, steroids injection should be administered and BPP assessed within 24 hours.\n4. If the score is <4, the fetus should be delivered.\n(Choice B) Contraction stress test is indicated when the BFF scare is 6.\n(Choice C) BFF is reassuring in this patient and repeat in one week is enough.\n(Choice E) Delivery is indicated when BFF scare is <= 4.\nEducational Objective:\nTotal biophysical profile score of 8-10 is cansidered narmal, and should only be repeated once ar twice weekly until term far high risk pregnancies."

    "question": "A 54-year-old Caucasian female is complaining of hat flashes, vaginal dryness and irritability. Her symptoms started about a year ago, and have been gradually getting worse. She has not had a menstrual period for 12 months. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily and drinks a glass of wine occasionally. The cardiorespiratory examination is unremarkable. Inspection of her vagina reveals dryness and atrophy. She asks about the risks and benefits of combination harmane replacement therapy (HRT). Which of the following is NOT an appropriate statement to make regarding this treatment modality?",
    "options": [
      "A. There is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism",
      "B. There is no increased risk of endometrial cancer with combination HRT",
      "C. A benefit is protection against osteoporosis",
      "D. There is a reduction in the risk of colon cancer when using combination HRT",
      "E. A benefit of combination HRT is a decreased risk of coronary artery disease"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This waman is going through menopause as evidenced by her age, amenorrhea for the past year, and symptoms of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and irmitability. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be used to manage her symptoms; however, before beginning therapy, it is important to discuss the associated benefits and risks.\nFor the past few decades, long-term (greater than five years) estrogen and combined estrogen-pragestin therapy had been routinely prescribed in postmenopausal patients for the prevention of coronary heart disease; however, data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) have changed this practice. Subsequent trials and meta-analyses have supported the data from the WHI trial.\nThe fallowing are conclusions fram the WHI trial:\n1. There is no cardiovascular benefit with either unopposed estrogen or combined estrogen-progestin therapy. In fact, the study suggests that there is some increase in risk with combined therapy.\n2. There is an increased risk of stroke with long-term use of bath unopposed estrogen and combined estrogen-progestin therapy.\n3. There is an increased risk of breast cancer with combined estrogen-progestin therapy, but not with unopposed estrogen.\nBased an this information, the only recommendations for HRT are for the short-term use of controlling menopausal symptoms. For prevention of osteoporosis, other modalities such as bisphosphonates or raloxifen should be considered.\n(Choices C and D) The benefits of HRT are that it helps relieve the symptoms of vaginal dryness, hat flashes and some of the mental changes seen in menopause. It also protects against osteoporosis, and to a minor degree against colon cancer.\n(Choices A and B) The risks of HRT include an associated increased incidence of venous thromboembolism and endometrial hyperplasialcancer (only with unopposed estrogen). This risk can be largely reduced by the addition of progestin therapy. Therefore, unless a woman has had a hysterectomy, the recommended regimen includes combination oral estrogen and progestin.\nEducational Objective:\nHormone replacement therapy is now only recommended for the short-term use of controlling menopausal symptoms. Large studies, such as the WHI, have shown that the long-term use of combined HRT can slightly increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke."

    "question": "A 26-year-old woman presents for evaluation of infertility. She describes her menstrual cycles as irregular stating that they occur anywhere between 32 to 35 days. She has no galactorrhea. She eats a balanced diet and exercises regularly. She has na other medical problems. Her BMI is 22 Kg/mZ2. Physical examination is unremarkable Which of the following is the mast apprapriate initial test ta evaluate her infertility?",
    "options": [
      "A. Endometrial biopsy",
      "B. Hysterosalpingogram",
      "C. Mid luteal serum progesterane level",
      "D. Serum testosterone",
      "E. Karyotyping"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The first step in evaluating infertility is a detailed history and physical examination. This patient's history of irregular menses indicates that she may not be ovulating normally. Patients wha are ovulating will typically have regular cycles of 25-35 days with menstrual bleeding far 3-7 days. They will also classically experience some midcycle pelvic pain when ovulation takes place. Ovulation can be confirmed by measuring a midluteal phase serum progesterane level. When ovulation occurs, the carpus luteum produces progesterone. Detection of this increased progesterone level (>= 10ng/mL, normal is <= 2ng/mL) on the 21st day of a 28 day cycle indicates that ovulation has occurred.\n(Choice A) Endometrial biopsy (EMB) can be used as an indicator of ovulation because increased levels of progesterone are trophic on the endometrium. A luteal phase defect is diagnosed when progesterone-related changes are not observed on EMB. This test, however, is subject to error in pathologic interpretation and in the time that the biopsy is taken.\n{Choice B) Hysterosalpingogram can be used to evaluate for structural defects in the female anatomy that may lead to infertility. These tests should be undertaken after evidence of ovulation has been confirmed.\n{Choice D) Serum testosterone should be assessed particularly if signs of hyperandrogenism are evident an physical examination.\n(Choice E) Karyotyping is a test often used in the assessment for male infertility and suspected Turner syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nInfertility in wamen with irregular menstrual cycles is often due to anovulation. Ovulation can be tested for by measuring a midluteal phase progesterone level."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 26 weeks gestation comes to the physician because of a decrease in fetal movements. She has felt few fetal kicks the past 20 hours. Her prenatal course, prenatal tests and fetal growth have been normal. She has chronic hypertension and is now taking methyldopa and labetalol. Her previous pregnancies were uncomplicated and both delivered vaginally. She does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. Fetal heart tones are heard by Doppler. Mon-stress test is reactive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Repeat non-stress test weekly",
      "B. Perform contraction stress test",
      "C. Biophysical profile",
      "D. Give vibroacoustic stimulation",
      "E. Deliver the baby immediately"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In the presence of decreased fetal movements, fetal compromise should be suspected and the best next step in management is a non-stress test (NST). NST is usually performed in high risk pregnancies starting at 32-34 weeks gestation or when there is a decrease in fetal movements in any pregnancy. NST is carried out by recording the fetal heart rate while manitaring for spontaneous perceived fetal movements. Atestis cansidered reactive (normal) if in 20 minutes 2 fetal heart rate accelerations of at least 15 beats per minute above the baseline lasting at least 15 seconds each are noted. If less than 2 accelerations are noted in 20 min, the test is nonreactive (abnarmal) and further assessment is required. The most common cause of a nonreactive NST is a sleeping baby, not a diseased baby, so vibroacoustic stimulation is used to wake the baby up and allow a timely test.\n(Choice B) Contraction stress testing (Oxytocin challenge test) is invasive and is not needed in this patient since NST is normal.\n(Choice C) Biophysical profile (BPP) is used if the NST is nonreactive despite vibroacoustic stimulation.\n(Choice D) Vibroacoustic stimulation is used after a non-reactive MST to avoid further testing, especially in low-risk pregnancies.\n(Choice E) The pregnancy is still not at term and the NST is reassuring, therefore, the fetus should not be delivered.\nEducational objective:\nA reactive nanstress test is reassuring and it should be repeated weekly."

    "question": "A 25-year-old woman at 28 weeks gestation comes to the ER because of strong, regular and painful uterine contractions that started 4 hours earlier with the passage of clear fluid fram her vagina. She denies any vaginal bleeding. She has had no prenatal care. Vital signs are normal. A sterile speculum examination shows poaling of amnictic fluid within the vagina, and a cervix that is 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced. Ultrasonogram in the emergency department shows an amniotic fluid index of 4 and bilateral renal agenesis in the fetus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Allow spontaneous vaginal delivery",
      "B. Consent far cesarean section",
      "C. Administer corticosteroids",
      "D. Amniginfusion and tacolysis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has preterm labor with rupture of the membranes. In this case, the fetus has a severe cangenital anomaly incompatible with life, so labor should be allowed to proceed. Patients with bilateral renal agenesis will not survive outside the uterus because af the severe pulmonary hypoplasia associated with renal agenesis. They will survive in utero because the placenta oxygenates the fetal blood and remaoves waste products from the fetal circulation.\n{Choice B) There is na need for a cesarean section, which increases maternal morbidity, as the fetus can be evacuated vaginally.\n(Choices C & D) Since the fetal anomaly is nat compatible with life, all attempts to prolong pregnancy will not improve fetal mortality, and delivery should be allowed to proceed.\nEducational objective:\nLabor should be allowed to proceed in patients where the fetus has been diagnosed with a severe congenital anomaly incompatible with life."

    "question": "A 30-year-old female comes to the office complaining of vaginal discharge, dyspareunia and vulvar pruritus. She has a history of hypathyroidism and takes thyroid replacement therapy. She uses tobacca and alcohol every day. On examination, you notice a thin, grayish vaginal discharge and erythema and edema of the vulva and vaginal mucosa. The pH of the discharge is 6.0 and wet-mount examination reveals pear-shaped matile organisms. First line treatment is prescribed for bath the patient and her partner. The patient must avoid which of the following during the treatment period?",
    "options": [
      "A. Grapefruit juice",
      "B. Alcohol use",
      "C. Midday sun exposure",
      "D. Thyroid supplements",
      "E. Tabacco use"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The findings of thin vaginal discharge, erythematous vaginal mucosa, and motile pear-shaped organisms on wet-moaunt, are all characteristic of trichomanal vaginitis. Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for this condition. If alcohol is taken during metronidazole therapy, a disulfiram-like reaction may result in which acetaldehyde accumulates in the blood stream. This causes flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension. For this reason, all patients who take metronidazole should abstain from drinking alcohol.\n(Choice A) Grapefruit juice is known to inhibit the P450 system. Intake of grapefruit juice should be limited in patients taking medications which are processed by the P450 system (e.g. cyclosparing].\n{Choice C) Sun exposure should be limited while taking tetracycline, as this antibiotic can cause photosensitivity.\n(Choice D) There is no adverse interaction between thyroid supplements and metronidazale.\n(Choice E) Despite the myriad negative health consequences of tobacco use, it does not interfere with metronidazole therapy.\nEducational objective:\nAll patients wha take metronidazole should abstain fram drinking alcohol, as it is associated with a disulfiram-like reaction."

    "question": "A 16-year-old Caucasian female is brought to your office by her mother who is concerned that her daughter has not had menstrual bleedings yet. Her past medical histary is significant for an episode of severe bilateral pneumania that required hospitalization when she was seven years old. Physical examination reveals Tanner stage 3 breast development, but very little pubic and axillary hair. A left-sided inguinal mass is palpated. A blind vaginal pouch is noted on pelvic exam. A karyotype analysis showed 46 XY. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Start progesterone supplementation",
      "B. Start low-dose corticosteroid therapy",
      "C. Perform gonadectomy",
      "D. Reassurance and repeat follow-up",
      "E. Use ketoconazole"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The combination of primary amenorrhea, bilateral inguinal masses, and breast development without pubic ar axillary hair is strongly suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome. This condition is related to a mutation af the androgen receptor (AR) gene making peripheral tissues unresponsive to andragens that are typically available in normal concentrations in these patients. Although the genotype is 46 XY, female phenotype develops. Breast development is present because testosterone is converted to estrogen, but there is little or no pubic ar axillary hair. No mullerian structure is present (uterus, fallopian tube) and the vagina ends with a blind pouch. Testes can be documented with abdominal ultrasonogram in the inguinal canal or in the lakia. Because of increased (5%) risk for testicular carcinoma, which typically develops in the second or third decade, a ganadectomy is indicated in these patients. Estrogen therapy, not progesterane therapy, can be used at the time of expected puberty if a gonadectomy is performed prepubertal.\nEducational Objective:\nThe combination of primary amenorrhea, bilateral inguinal masses, and breast development without pubic ar axillary hair is strongly suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome. A blind vaginal pouch and karyotype of 46 XY are other clues. A gonadectomy should be performed ta avoid the risk of testicular carcinoma."

    "question": "A 30-year-old female delivers a term male infant with signs of thyrotoxicosis. Prior to the pregnancy, she was surgically treated for Graves disease and was prescribed hormane replacement therapy in the form of levothyroxine 0.25 mg daily. Levothyroxine was maintained during pregnancy and thyroid hormone levels were monitored and maintained within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the neonate's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Levothyroxine therapy",
      "B. Active thyroid tissue in the mother secreting thyroid hormone",
      "C. Persistence of thyroid stimulating immunaglobulin in the mother",
      "D. Inadequate surgery with persistence of thyroid tissue post-operatively"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "In many patients with Graves disease, the circulating levels of thyroid stimulating immunaglobulin (TSI) remain as high as 500 times the normal value for several months following thyroidectomy. These IgG autoantibodies cross the placenta and can cause thyrotoxicosis in the fetus and the neonate by directly stimulating the fetal thyroid gland. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis is an uncomman clinical entity characterized by goiter, tachypnea, tachycardia, cardiomegaly, restlessness, diarrhea and poor weight gain in the infant typically within 1-2 days following delivery.\n(Choice A) Levathyroxine does not crass the placenta to a significant degree.\n(Choices B & D) This patient has been euthyroid since her thyroidectomy. This has been demonstrated by several thyroid hormone tests. The presence of excess hormane due to ectopic or residual tissue is not likely given her euthyroid state.\nEducational objective:\nInfants born to patients with Graves disease treated with surgery are at risk for thyrotoxicosis because of the passage of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin across the placenta."

      "A. Intense exercise",
      "B. Hypothyroidism",
      "C. Premature ovarian failure",
      "D. Adrenal hyperplasia",
      "E. Oocyte aging",
      "F. Fallopian tube obstruction",
      "G. Uterine leiomyomas"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The patient described does nat meet the strict definition of infertility as she has not been attempting to become pregnant for mare than one year. Given this fact and the fact that the patient is still experiencing regular menstrual cycles, this patient is mast likely having trouble conceiving because of her age. An inverse relationship exists between increasing age and decreasing fertility. VWomen are barn with their full complement of oocytes, and as they age, this oocyte reserve slowly depletes. At birth, a woman possesses approximately 3 million oocytes, but by puberty this number is typically decreased to about 300,000. A significant drop in oocyte number (ovulatory reserve) takes place during a woman's fourth decade. Cne in five women aged between 35 and 39 is no longer fertile. Infertility due to aging can be assessed using an early follicular phase FSH level, a clomiphene challenge test ar an inhibin-B level.\n(Choice A) Intense exercise sufficient to induce anavulation would also mast likely result in amenorrhea. Patients at the greatest risk of exercise-induced infertility are long-distance runners. 30-60 minutes of daily aerobic exercise is considered normal and desirable.\n(Choices B & D) Endocrine disorders such as hypathyroidism and adrenal hyperplasia can be associated with anovulation.\n(Choice C) Premature avarian failure refers to avarian failure befare the age of 40. Premature avarian failure causes amenorrhea and can be caused by autoimmune conditions, heritable factors, exogenous factors such as radiation exposure and as an idiopathic condition.\n(Choices F & G) Fallopian tube obstruction and uterine leiomyomas are anatomic factors that may decrease fertility. This patient's history of a previous normal pregnancy coupled with the absence of sexually transmitted diseases makes either of these factors unlikely. A uterine leiomyoma may be present, but she has no symptoms or signs of this candition.\nEducational objective:\nThe most common cause for decreased fertility in women in their fourth decade who are still experiencing menstrual cycles is age-related decreased avarian reserve."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Prolactin production is inhibited by dopamine and stimulated by serotonin and TRH. An increase in TSH and TRH production and, consequently, in pralactin release may be the result of hypathyroidism. Hyperpraolactinemia may also affect GnRH and gonadotropin secretion and, thus, result in amenorrhea. Other causes of high prolactin levels include dopamine antagonists (antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs), hypothalamic and pituitary tumors. In the present case, the patient is nat under any dopamine antaganists and has na clinical signs indicating the presence of a hypothalamic ar pituitary tumor; therefare the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to rule out the mast benign etiology, that is, hypothyroidism, by measuring TSH.\n(Choice B) TRH is not useful in diagnasing hypothyroidism.\n{Choices C, D, and E) Sellar MRI or CT scan, as well as visual field study, may all be useful if a hypothalamic or pituitary tumor is suspected. At this stage, hypothyroidism has to be ruled out first.\nEducational Objective:\nIn the case of amenarrhea-hyperprolactinemia, first rule out hypothyroidism by measuring serum TSH."

      "D. Blood redistribution to the upper trunk",
      "E. CNS involvement"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is suggestive of hypotension as a side effect of epidural anesthesia. Hypotension complicates up to 10% of epidural blocks given during labor, but if considered early, can be easily prevented and treated. The cause of hypotension is sympathetic fiber block that results in vasodilatation of the lower extremity vessels. Blood redistribution to the lower extremities (Choice D) and venous pooling occur. Cardiac output decreases and hypotension results.\n(Choice A) Depressed myocardial contractility develops during myocardial infarction and is usually accompanied by chest pain and dyspnea, and the hypotension due to cardiogenic shock has dismal prognosis.\n(Choice B) Intravascular fluid loss is typically caused by external or internal hemarrhage, which is unlikely in this case because no obvious source of blood loss is present.\n(Choice E) CNS involvement with vasoregulatory center black is a rare, but very dangerous complication of epidural anesthesia. CNS symptoms (e.g. excitation, disorientation, seizure) usually precede cardiovascular symptoms in such a case.\nEducational objective:\nHypotension is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia. The cause of hypotension is blood redistribution to the lower extremities and venous pooling."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This woman has breast engorgement, comman in the first 24 to 72 hours after childbirth secondary to milk accumulation. While it may occur at any point during breast feeding, it is especially common early in the postpartum period when milk production is particularly robust. Symptoms include breast fullness, tenderness, and warmth. It typically peaks 3 to 5 days postpartum and improves spontaneously in mast patients. Cool compresses, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs may be used for symptom control.\n(Choice A) Mastitis is a breast infection that causes unilateral breast pain with an isolated firm, tender, erythematous area accompanied by fever greater than 38.3°C. [tis distinguished fram plugged ducts by the presence of fever. Anti-staphylococcal agents are first-line therapy. This patient has bilateral, not unilateral, symptoms, which would be unusual far mastitis.\n(Choice B) Breast abscesses are rare and present similarly to mastitis but with a palpable fluctuant mass. They are treated with antibiotics and drainage.\n(Choice D) Plugged ducts present similarly to mastitis but lack fever or systemic symptoms. They are treated by impraving the quality of breastfeeding. Persistently plugged ducts resulting in galactocele may be treated with aspiration.\n(Choice E) Superficial vein thrombosis can cause tenderness and localized erythema but is unlikely to cause bilateral tense breasts.\nEducational objective:\nBreast engorgement is a common problem associated with breast feeding. Characterized by bilateral breast tenderness and swelling, it typically presents 24 to 72 hours post partum, peaks 3 to 5 days after delivery, and resalves spontaneously."

    "question": "An 18-year-old woman arrives in your clinic with primary amenorrhea, sexual infantilism, and clitoromegaly. She has a histary of ambiguous external genitalia noted at birth. Reviewing her records, you see that laparotomy performed at 17 months of age revealed normal internal female genitalia and ovarian biopsy performed at that time revealed normal-appearing primordial follicles. Laboratory studies today reveal a normal female karyotype and high serum testosterone and androstenedione concentrations. Estradiol and estrone are undetectable in the serum. Serum FSH and LH concentrations are high. Pelvic imaging shows multiple ovarian cysts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia",
      "B. Aromatase deficiency",
      "C. McCune-Albright syndrome",
      "D. Kallmann's syndrome",
      "E. Galactosemia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Aromatase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder marked by either total absence or poor functioning of the enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens. Its consequences are numerous. fn ufera the placenta will not be able to make estrogens, leading to masculinization of the mather that resolves after delivery. The high levels of gestational androgens result in a virllized Xx child with narmal internal genitalia but ambiguous external genitalia. Clitaromeqgaly is often seen when excessive androgens are present in utero. Later in life patients will have delayed puberty, osteoporosis, undetectable circulating estrogens, high concentrations of gonadotropins and polycystic ovaries. This patient's history of narmal internal genitalia with ambiguous external genitalia, clitaral hypertrophy, and high FSH/LH with low estrogen is consistent with aromatase deficiency.\n{Choice A) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can cause pseudohermaphroditism in females with virilization, as well as salt wasting. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause. In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, estrogen is still synthesized and internal genitalia are narmal.\n(Choice C) McCune-Albright syndrome is marked by the triad of café au lait spots, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and autonomous endocrine hyperfunction. The most commaon endocrine feature is gonadatropin-independent precocious puberty. Thus, patients have early puberty, in contrast to the ambiguous genitalia and delayed menarche in the patient described above.\n(Choice D) Kallman's syndrome is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia. Patients will have delayed puberty but, unlike this patient, have law ar absent LH and FSH levels.\n(Choice E) Galactosemia is due to deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. It results in galactose-1-phasphate accumulation in the liver, brain, and kidney which leads to cirrhasis, mental retardation, and Fanconi's syndrome. [tis nat strongly associated with reproductive abnormalities.\nEducational objective:\nCongenital aromatase deficiency is a rare enzyme deficiency that prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogens. It causes gestational maternal virilization and wvirilization of xx fetuses. Thus, affected girls will have normal internal genitalia with ambiguous external genitalia."

    "question": "A 25-year-old woman is referred to the physician for lactation suppression after the death of her 1-manth-ald infant from severe sepsis. She is very depressed and complains of breast fullness and tenderness. Examination shows both breasts are warm, firm and tender to palpation. Prenatal records show no abnormalities except mild varicosities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Frequent emptying of breasts",
      "B. Tight fitting bra and ice packs",
      "C. Conjugated estrogen",
      "D. Dexamethasone",
      "E. Bromocriptine therapy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Af delivery, milk production is activated by two major mechanisms: the sudden decrease in estrogen and progesterone that, prior to delivery, interfere with the action of prolactin on lactation and the release of prolactin and oxytocin through the stimulatory effect of suckling. Prolactin is responsible far milk synthesis whereas oxytocin mediates contraction of the lactiferous glands and ducts resulting in the excretion of milk. Lactation suppression is indicated for patients such as in this case or those who do not desire to breastfeed. Lactation suppression is accomplished by use of a tight-fitting bra, avoidance of nipple stimulation or manipulation, application of ice packs to the breasts and analgesics to manage the pain. There is no role for medications in the suppression of breast milk production.\n(Choice A) Emptying af the breasts will only maintain milk production and thus, make the condition worse.\n{Choice C) Estrogen therapy was used in the past for lactation suppression but is na longer recommended because of the increased risk of thramboembalism.\n{Choice D) Dexamethasane is not indicated for lactation suppression.\n(Choice E) Bromacriptine was caommanly used but is na longer FDA approved far this purpose because of the side effects. It is a dopamine agonist that acts by inhibiting pralactin secretion by the anterior pituitary thus suppressing lactation.\nEducational objective:\nThere is no role for medications in the suppression of breast milk production. Patients are advised to wear a tight-fitting bra, avoid nipple manipulation and use ice packs and analgesics to relieve associated pain."

    "question": "A 34-year-old obese female returns to the physician's office for a follow-up appaintment at 16 weeks gestation. She was diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 12 weeks gestation and since then has been following dietary recommendations. She eats a balanced diabetic diet three times a day and avoids snacks. Her fasting blood sugars for the past two weeks have been in between 120 to 150 mg/dL. Her temperature is 37.0C (98.7F), blood pressure is 130/88 mmHg, pulse is 76/min and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the mast appropriate therapy for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chlorpropamide",
      "B. Tolbutamide",
      "C. Insulin",
      "D. Exenatide"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described has gestational diabetes that has not responded to a trial of a diabetic diet. Diagnosing and appropriately treating gestational diabetes is important as pregnancies in the setting of uncontrolled disease are at increased risk of miscarriage, abnormally large size, congenital malformations, preterm birth, pyelonephritis, preeclampsia, meconium aspiration and stillbirth. The ideal range of maternal fasting glucose is between 75 and 90 mg/dL. Treatment of gestational diabetes is best accomplished with subcutaneous insulin, which is classified as a category B agent and does nat cross the placenta.\n(Choices A & B) Chlorpropamide and tolbutamide cross the placenta and can cause fetal hyperinsulinemia, macrosomia and prolonged neonatal hypoglycemia. These agents are classified as pregnancy categary C.\n(Choice D) Exenatide is an analog of the hormone incretin that increases insulin production by pancreatic beta cells, stimulates growth and replication of beta cells and slows gastric emptying. It warks synergistically with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and metformin and is classified as pregnancy categary C.\n(Choice E) Continue dietary therapy is insufficient ta treat this patient's gestational diabetes as she has thus far been unable to obtain good glycemic contral. The risks of continued hyperglycemia demand treatment at this time.\nEducational objective:\nGestational diabetes is most commaonly first treated with a low sugar diet, but if diet fails to produce euglycemia, insulin is the treatment of choice."

      "C. Hyperviscosity",
      "D. Intussusception",
      "E. Mental retardation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Gestational diabetes carries numerous risks for the fetus including macrosomia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperviscosity due to palycythemia, respiratory difficulties, cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Palycythemia in an infant of a diabetic mother is the result of fetal hypoxia that accurs in the face of the increased basal metabolic rate induced by hyperglycemia. Increased erythropoietin production by the fetus increases the red blood cell mass and oxygen carrying capacity af the blood.\n(Choice A) Hypoglycemia, NOT hyperglycemia typically occurs in infants of diabetic mothers due ta the high baseline insulin production in these infants. Once delivered, they are no longer exposed to the high glucose load from the mother and their hyperinsulinemia results in hypoglycemia.\n(Choice B) Hypacalcemia is typical in infants of diabetic mothers due ta parathyroid hormane suppressian.\n{Choice D) Intussusception occurs in association with a variety of factors including Meckel diverticulae and Henach-Schdnlein purpura.\n(Choice E) Mental retardation has numerous causes. Gestational diabetes, however, is not commanly associated with fetal mental retardation.\nEducational objective:\nGestational diabetes carries numerous risks far the fetus including macrosomia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperviscosity due to palycythemia, respiratory difficulties, cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure."

    "question": "A 25-year-old female comes to the physician because of abdominal bloating, headache, fatigue, weight gain, anxiety, and decreased libido. She experiences these symptoms seven ta ten days before the start of each menstrual cycle. She has a past history of postpartum depression, but she denies any recent feelings of hopelessness or guilt. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Complete blood count, serum chemistries and thyroid stimulating hormone levels are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cognitive behavioral therapy",
      "B. Prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors",
      "C. Advise menstrual diary",
      "D. Insight oriented and supportive psychotherapy",
      "E. Prescribe alprazolam"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This woman's presentation is most consistent with premenstrual syndrame (PMS). The most comman physical manifestations of FMS are bloating, fatigue, headaches, and breast tenderness. Psychological symptoms may include anxiety, mood swings, difficulty concentrating, decreased libido and irritability. Symptoms usually begin one to two weeks prior to menses, and regress around the time of menstrual flow. Symptoms are then typically absent until the next ovulatian.\nMaintaining a menstrual diary for at least 3 cycles is a useful aid for confirming the diagnosis in suspected cases; FMS is confirmed when symptoms occur repeatedly and predictably in the days prior to menstruation and are absent or less severe during the follicular (proliferative) phase. If symptoms are present throughout the menstrual cycle, then other conditions such as mood disorder are more likely.\n(Choices A, B, D, & E) Once the diagnosis of PMS is confirmed, treatment depends on the patient's complaints. There is no universally accepted treatment. Reduction of caffeine intake may reduce breast symptoms. An exercise program may be effective in improving the general well being of the patient. In women whose symptoms are more severe and cause socioeconomic dysfunction, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drug of choice. When SSRIs fail to alleviate symptoms in such patients despite therapy over multiple cycles, low dose alprazolam is indicated. Relaxation techniques and bright light therapy have some proven effect in management of PMS, but cognitive behavioral therapy and insight ariented and supportive psychotherapy do not play a role. Treatment should not be initiated until the diagnosis is made.\nEducational objective:\nA menstrual diary for at least 3 cycles is a useful aid for confirming the diagnosis in suspected cases of PMS. Confirmation of the diagnosis must be made befare initiating treatment."

    "question": "A 23-year-old, gravida 2, para 1 woman at 30 weeks gestation comes to the ER after she noticed a sudden gush of clear fluid coming fram her vagina. She has had no uterine contractions ar vaginal bleeding. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated: she has had consistent prenatal care. Vital signs are narmal. Sterile speculum examination shows the cervix is minimally effaced and 2 cm dilated; there is pooling of clear fluid in the vaginal fornix, and when pressure is applied to the fundus, clear fluid comes out of the cervix. Emergency ultrasound shows a fetus of average size in the vertex presentation and an Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) of 15. Monstress test shows a baseline of 120 bpm and frequent accelerations. Amniotic fluid analysis shows lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio of 1.0. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Amniainfusion",
      "B. Immediate vaginal delivery",
      "C. Cesarean section",
      "D. Betamethasone",
      "E. Repair of ruptured membranes"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Rupture of the fetal membranes at any time before the onset of labor is referred to as premature rupture of membranes (FROM). When rupture occurs befare term, it is known as preterm PROM (PPROM). The diagnosis of ROM is mainly clinical. The patient usually complains of either a gush or continual leakage of clear fluid from the vagina. On examination, amniotic fluid may be noted in the vagina or leaking fram the cervix when the Valsalva maneuver ar slight fundal pressure is applied. In this case, PPROM is the diagnosis, and amniotic fluid sampling to measure fetal lung indices is mandatary. Ultrasound examination should also be performed to detect fetal anomalies, determine gestational age and measure amniatic volume. In this case of PPROM, the pregnancy is less than 34 weeks gestational age, and the L/S ratio is less than 2.0; therefore, prematurity is a major concern. Steroid treatment is effective at this stage of pregnancy (between 24 and 34 weeks) in accelerating lung maturity and should be used. Mo tocalysis is indicated as the patient has no uterine contractions.\n(Choice A) The amniotic fluid index is narmal (>=5 and <25), so there is no need far amniginfusian. tis sometimes used in oligohydramnios ta prevent its complications.\n(Choices B & C) There are nao signs of fetal distress at this point sa delivery should not be expedited. The fetus would be best served by systemic corticosteroid treatment as fetal lung immaturity is associated with the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, which is associated with increased marbidity and mortality in the fetus.\n(Choice E) Membrane repair is an investigational technique whereby the membranes are sealed by insertion of a gelatin sponge to plug the cervix. The fetus described has a normal AF and is not presently in distress.\nEducational objective:\nThe most important complication of PFROM is pulmonary hypoplasia (immaturity). Steroids are used to enhance fetal lung maturity when premature rupture of membranes occurs at less than 34-weeks of gestation."

      "D. Biologic agent therapy",
      "E. Send her to hospice"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This 83-year-old woman presents with a vaginal tumor that is identified as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) an biopsy. SCC is the most common form of vaginal cancer, and risk for SCC of the vagina increases with age (mast camman in women >=60 years of age). The most cammon symptoms are vaginal bleeding and malodorous vaginal discharge. Definitive diagnasis is made by biopsy. Treatment of vaginal cancer depends an staging. Stage | and Il tumars (no extension to the pelvic wall and no metastases) which are less than 2 cm in size may be removed surgically, while stage | and Il tumars which are greater than 2 cm in size are treated with radiation therapy. However, the point in this question is to recognize the best treatment modality given her age and co-morbid canditions. Even if her tumor is less than 3 cm in size she is a poor surgical candidate given her age and multiple medical problems. Radiation alone may be sufficient.\n(Choice A) Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice for isolated stage | and Il vaginal tumors which are less than 2 cm in size.\n(Choice C) Combination chemotherapy is used for Stage Ill and IV tumars as well as tumors greater than 4 cm in size. Again, she may not be a good candidate for chemotherapy, radiation alone might be sufficient.\n(Choice D) Biologic agent therapy does not play a role in management of SCC of the vagina.\n(Choice E) It would be inappropriate to send this patient ta hospice against the wishes of her power of attorney. Furthermare, the survival rates far Stage | and Il vaginal cancers are high with radiation therapy.\nEducational objective:\nRadiation therapy is highly effective for squamous cell carcinoma of vagina.

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital. She has regular uterine contractions. Her blood pressure is 120/70mmHg, pulse is 80/min and respirations are 18/min. Fetal heart manitaring is placed and shows a baseline rate of 130 beats/min, without any associated abnormalities. Pelvic examination shows the cervix is 50% effaced and 3cm dilated. Amniotomy is performed and a bloody show is noted. Immediately after the rupture of membranes, the baseline fetal heart rate increases to 160 beats/min and then drops to 70 beats/min. As labor progresses, repetitive late decelerations are nated, as well as an increase in vaginal bleeding. Repeat vital signs of the patient shows a blood pressure of 130/70mmHg, pulse of 80/min and respirations of 18/min. Which of the following is the mast likely cause of the current condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Premature separation of the placenta",
      "B. Abnormal placental implantation",
      "C. Abnormal umbilical vessels",
      "D. Excessive amniatic fluid",
      "E. Tear in uterine musculature"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This is a typical presentation of a ruptured fetal umbilical vessel: an antepartum hemorrhage with very characteristic fetal heart changes progressing from tachycardia to bradycardia to a sinusoidal pattern. If fetal bleeding is suspected, an Apt test - which differentiates maternal from fetal blood - can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Vasa previa is a rare condition in which the fetal blood vessels traverse the fetal membranes across the lower segment of the uterus between the baby and the internal cervical os (velamentous cord insertion). These vessels are vulnerable to tearing during natural or artificial rupture of the membranes. The condition carries a high fetal mortality rate (75%) due to fetal exsanguination. When this condition is diagnosed, the treatment is an immediate caesarian section delivery (\"crash C-section”).\n(Choice A) Abruptio placenta is a premature placental separation initiated by hemorrhage in the decidua basalis. It typically presents with dark red antepartum hemorrhage along with abdominal pain, uterine tenderness and increased uterine tone. The bleeding is of maternal origin.\n{Choice B) Placenta previa is an abnormal insertion in the placenta an the lower segment of the uterus near ar over the cervical os. It manifests as painless antepartum hemarrhage, and the bleeding is maternal in arigin.\n{Choice D) Excessive amniotic fluid (hydramniaos, polyhydramnios) causes symptoms in the mother as a result of compression on the lungs, abdominal organs and vasculature. Difficulty breathing and lower extremity edema are comman. Placental abruption and postpartum hemarrhage due ta uterine atany are associated with hydramnios.\n(Choice E) Uterine rupture presents with intense abdominal pain associated with vaginal bleeding that can range from spotting to severe hemarrhage. The bleeding is maternal in origin. Regression of the fetal presenting parts and palpability of fetal limbs on abdominal exam is typical.\nEducational objective:\nAn antepartum hemorrhage with fetal heart changes progressing fram tachycardia to bradycardia and finally to a sinusoidal pattern occurring suddenly after rupture of membranes suggests the diagnosis of vasa previa. The bleeding in this setting is fetal in origin, so maternal vital signs will remain stable while the fetus exsanguinates."

      "C. Contraction stress test",
      "D. Ultrasonography",
      "E. Deliver the baby immediately"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In the presence of decreased fetal movements, fetal compromise should be suspected and the best next step in management is a nonstress test (NST). NST is usually performed in high risk pregnancies starting at 32-34 weeks gestation or when there is a loss of perception of fetal movements in any pregnancy. NST is carried aut by recording the fetal heart rate while monitoring for spontaneous perceived fetal movements. A test is considered reactive (normal) if in 20 minutes 2 accelerations of the fetal heart rate of at least 15 beats per minute above the baseline lasting at least 15 seconds each are noted. If less than 2 accelerations are noted in 20 min, the test is considered nonreactive (abnormal) and further assessment is required. The mast comman cause of a nonreactive NST is a sleeping baby, not a diseased baby, so vibroacoustic stimulation is used to wake the baby up and allow a timely test.\n(Choice B) A biophysical profile (BFF) is a scoring system designed to evaluate fetal well-being. tis indicated in high risk pregnancies and in cases of maternal ar physician concern, decreased fetal movements ar a non-reactive NST.\n(Choice C) In a contraction stress test (Oxytocin challenge test), the mother is given an infusion of oxytocin sufficient to result in 3 contractions per 10 minutes, and the effect these contractions have on fetal heart activity is recorded. If a late deceleration is noted at each contraction, the test is positive and delivery is usually recommended. Because this is a mare invasive test, it is not used as an initial examination.\n{Choice D) Ultrasonography is not as sensitive as NST ar BPP for evaluation of decreased fetal movements and fetal well-being. It is, however, the first step if fetal demise is suspected as it can document the presence or absence of fetal heart movement.\n(Choice E) Delivery is indicated when significant signs of fetal distress or maternal deterioration are present.\nEducational objective:\nIf fetal movement decreases or becomes imperceptible by the mother, then a nonstress test should be carried out to document fetal well-being."

IUGR, or oligohydramnios.\nPatients with severe preeclampsia are at greater risk of developing eclampsia. However, 25% of eclamptic patients have a background of only mild disease. In eclampsia, cerebral vasospasm results in cerebral hypoxemia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 25% of cases of eclampsia occur befare labor, 50% occur during labor and 25% occur following delivery. Increased reflex irritability is a worrisome sign in patients with preeclampsia and it usually heralds the occurrence of seizures.\n(Choice A) Eclampsia is a specialized subset of hypertensive encephalopathy that occurs in the setting of preeclampsia. Hypertensive encephalopathy in general is characterized clinically by headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances and seizures.\n(Choice B) Uremic encephalopathy is unlikely as this patient's renal function is nearly normal.\n(Choice C) Viral encephalitis typically presents with new-anset psychiatric symptoms, seizures and cognitive and motor deficits.\n(Choice E) Brain abscess may present with headache and seizures. Focal neurologic deficits are also commanly observed, and hypertension and proteinuria are not typical features.\n(Choice F) Intracerebral hemorrhage (stroke) typically presents with rapid-onset loss of consciousness, vomiting and focal neurologic deficits. Hypertension is one of the most important causes of stroke.\n(Choice G) Migraine headaches are classically preceded by a visual aura and are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. Proteinuria and hypertension are not typical.\nEducational objective:\nEclampsia is diagnosed when unexplained convulsions occur in the setting of preeclampsia."

      "D. Uterine rupture",
      "E. Normal labor"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Placenta previa refers to insertion of the placenta in a way that obstructs the internal cervical as partially or completely. This abnormal insertion may cause bleeding as the inferior segment of the uterus develops and stretches the placenta. Placenta previa is responsible for 20 % of all cases of antepartum hemarrhage and is typically painless. Risk factors include multiparity, advanced maternal age, prior caesarian section, smoking, multiple gestation (as multiple placentas cover a larger surface and have a higher risk of low insertion) and priar placenta previa.\n(Choice A) Abruptio placenta is a premature placental separation initiated by hemarrhage in the decidua basalis. It is classically assaciated with underlying maternal hypertension. The clinical presentation is variable. Patients may be asymptomatic with intrauterine fetal death ar may present with dark red vaginal bleeding associated with painful uterine contractions.\n{Choice C) “Yasa previa is a rare condition in which the fetal blood vessels cross the fetal membranes in the lower segment of the uterus between the fetus and the internal cervical os. It also presents as painless antepartum hemarrhage but is associated with rapid deterioration of the fetal heart tracing as the hemorrhage is of fetal origin.\n(Choice D) Uterine rupture classically presents with a sudden onset of intense abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding associated with hyperventilation, agitation and tachycardia.\n(Choice E) Normal labor presents with regular contractions associated with cervical dilation, release of the mucous plug and bloody show due to tearing of small cervical veins.

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 12 weeks gestation comes to the physician because of a dark brown vaginal discharge. She had a mild brown vaginal discharge 3 weeks ago, which resolved without any intervention. She noticed similar discharge again two days ago. For the past two weeks, she has not had nausea or breast tenderness, which she used to have before. She does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. Her temperature is 37.0C (98.7F), blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg, pulse is 85/min and respirations are 15/min. Physical examination shows a soft uterus and a closed cervix. Fetal heart tones are not present. Which of the following is the mast appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Quantitative beta-HCG measurement",
      "B. Pelvic ultrasonography",
      "C. Charionic villous sampling",
      "D. Check PT/ANR and PTT",
      "E. Reassurance and routine follow-up"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has experienced a spontaneous abartion, which is defined as fetal demise before the 20th week of gestation and with a fetus weighing less than 500 grams. There are numerous forms of spontaneous abortion; the form described here is a missed abortion. Missed abortion is characterized by fetal demise with retained products of conception (fetus, placenta, etc.) and a closed cervix. Characteristically, patients with a missed abortion will experience a loss of their pregnancy symptoms (i.e. decreased nausea and breast tenderness) and some brown discharge may be noted following fetal demise. The most appropriate next step in making the diagnosis of a spontaneous abortion is a transvaginal ultrasound ta document the presence of intrauterine products of conception and to attempt to visualize mation of the fetal heart.\n(Choice A) Quantitative beta-HCG measurement can continue to be elevated following a spontaneous abartian with retained products of conception.\n(Choice C) Charionic villous sampling is a procedure used to obtain fetal tissue for genetic analysis. Itis typically used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities.\n{Choice D) Checking the FT/INR and PTT is appropriate if DIC is suspected, and DIC may occur in the setting of a missed abortion wath prolonged retention of the products of conception.\n(Choice E) Reassurance and rautine follow-up are nat indicated until fetal well-being has been established by a transvaginal ultrasound that indicates size in agreement with dates, fetal mation and / or fetal heart mavement.\nEducational objective:\nA missed abartion is a form of spontaneous abortion that is characterized by intrauterine fetal death befare 20 weeks gestational age with complete retained products of conception and a closed cervix. Patients typically present with loss of pregnancy symptoms and same brown vaginal discharge, and a transvaginal ultrasound is necessary ta canfirm the diagnasis."

    "question": "Quantitative beta-HCG level is similar ta her previous value, which was obtained 4 weeks ago. Pelvic ultrasonogram reveals absent fetal cardiac activity and small gestational sac. Coagulation studies are within narmal limits. Which of the following is the mast appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Serial beta-HCG monitoring",
      "B. Dilatation and curettage",
      "C. Hospitalization and bed rest",
      "D. Methotrexate therapy",
      "E. Oxytocin infusion"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The diagnosis of a missed abortion can be confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound as described in the question stem. In this case, documenting the absence of fetal heart movement an ultrasound is the most significant indicator that the fetus has expired. The mather's coagulation studies are within normal limits. This is reassuring as retained products of conception (FOC) can rarely cause a coagulopathy. The appropriate treatments in this setting all involve ensuring that there is complete elimination of the POC from the uterus. This can be accomplished surgically with a dilation and curettage, medically with misoprostol or mifepristone and expectantly by simply monitoring the mather to ensure that the POC eliminate naturally, which does occur in the majarity of cases in time.\n{Choice A) Serial beta-HCG manitaring wall show a downward trend to normal following death of the fetus, but this intervention will not directly address the retained POC.\n(Choice C) Hospitalization and bed rest is not necessary as the fetus is not viable. Conservative management can be carried out with the patient at home with regular clinical follow-up and transvaginal ultrasound to ensure complete natural evacuation of the uterus.\n{Choice D) Methotrexate therapy is used in some cases of early ectopic pregnancy as an abortifacient due to its specificity for rapidly dividing cells. The fetus in this case is dead, and methotrexate would not facilitate elimination of the POC fram the uterus. A dead fetus is, in fact, a contraindication to the use of methotrexate.\n(Choice E) Oxytocin infusion would stimulate uterine contractions and likely expel the retained fetus, but this can more readily be accomplished with vaginal misoprostol without systemic effects and the additional invasiveness of an intravenous catheter.\nEducational objective:\nThe most appropriate treatment for a missed abortion is removal of the FOC from the uterus. This can be accomplished surgically with dilation and curettage, medically with vaginal misoprostol or expectantly with serial imaging to ensure complete natural expulsion of the POC."

    "question": "A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 38 weeks' gestation was admitted to the delivery room for management af labor. On admission B-hours ago, the patient was in the active phase of labor and the cervix was 4 cm dilated. She was then placed under external tocometer and epidural anesthesia. Contractions were regular, accurring 2-3 minutes apart and lasting 40-60 secands. She progressed wellta 7 cm. However, she has remained at 7 cm the past 4-hours. The fetus is in the Left Occipita Anterior (LOA) position and at +1 station. Internal pelvic assessment shows prominent ischial spines. Electronic fetal heart manitaring shows 140 bpm with normal beat-to-beat and long term variability. Prenatal ultrasound at 37-weeks showed no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's anomaly of labar?",
    "options": [
      "A. Inlet dystocia",
      "B. Midpelvis contraction",
      "C. Macrosomic baby",
      "D. Hypaotanic uterine cantractions",
      "E. Injudicious analgesia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has an arrest disorder of dilation because cervical dilation has been the same for 4 hours (mare than 2). Arrest disorder can also be of descent when the descent has not progressed for mare than 1 hour. It can be caused by hypotonic contractions, conduction anesthesia, excessive sedation, cephalopelvic disproportion ar malpresentation. In the present case, the arrest is resulting from a midpelvic contraction indicated by the prominence of the ischial spines.\n(Choice A) The descent of the presenting part is at +1, indicating that fetus is engaged, and therefare, an unlikeness of inlet dystocia.\n{Choice C) Prenatal ultrasound revealed nathing abnarmal, so the fetus is not a macrosomic.\n{Choice D) Uterine contractions are seemingly normal in this case. Moreover, the internal pelvic assessment evidenced prominent ischial spines, making midpelvic cantraction the most likely diagnosis.\n(Choice E) The patient was placed under epidural anesthesia in the active phase, so itis unlikely that it is the cause of the arrest. Anesthesia may cause a decrease in the strength of uterine contractions’ if it is administered in the latent phase.\nEducational Objective:\nMidpelvis contraction which is indicated by prominent ischial spines is an important cause of arrest disorder of dilation."

    "question": "A 24-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 36 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department after passing out. She is drowsy and moaning, complaining of abdominal pain. Her husband accompanies her. He states that she has not experienced any trauma, but that she experienced the sudden onset of severe abdaminal pain befare she passed out. She has no significant past medical history. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated thus far. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. She takes supplemental vitamins, but no ather medications. Her temperature is 36.9 C (98.4F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm of Hg, and pulse is 130/min. Physical examination shows a cold and diaphaoretic female. Examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 36-week gestation; the cervical os is closed and no vaginal bleeding is noted. Which of the following is the mast likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Placenta previa",
      "B. Abruptio placentae",
      "C. Preeclampsia",
      "D. Amniatic fluid embolism",
      "E. Septic shock"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Abruptio placentae is the most likely diagnosis in this patient given her sudden onset of abdominal pain in the third trimester and the absence of trauma. There is no vaginal bleeding noted on exam in this patient, but the absence of hemarrhage does nat rule out placental abruption. Bleeding is seen in 80% of placental abruptions, and in some cases bleeding may be retroplacental and nat appear on vaginal exam. The most comman risk factor far abruptio placentae is maternal hypertension. Other risk factors include cocaine abuse, trauma, excessive uterine distention, tobacco use, and previous placental abruption.\n(Choice A) Placenta previa presents with painless vaginal bleeding.\n{Choice C) Preeclampsia is associated with hypertension, prateinuria and edema.\n{Choice D) Amniatic fluid embolism usually occurs during amniocentesis or labor, and presents with respiratory failure and cardiac shock. Abdominal pain is not expected.\n(Choice E) Septic shock is unlikely without fever or any precipitating factors such as rupture of membranes ar urinary tract infection.\nEducational objective:\nThe classic manifestations of acute abruptio placentae include vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, uterine contractions, and uterine tenderness. The absence of blood an pelvic exam does not rule out this condition."

    "question": "A 24-year-old woman presents for her first prenatal visit at 12 weeks gestation. She was diagnosed with HIV two years ago, and her most recent CD4 count three months ago was 600cells/mm3. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following is the single mast important intervention for reducing maternal-fetal transmission of HIV infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. Elective cesarean section at 38 weeks gestation",
      "B. Use of forceps to expedite delivery",
      "C. Administering HIV immunoglobulin and vaccine to the neonate",
      "D. Zidovudine treatment of the mother during pregnancy and of the neonate after birth"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The most important intervention far preventing spread of HIV from mother to child is administration of zidovudine to the mother thraughout pregnancy and labor, as well as to the neanate for the first 6 weeks of life. This intervention has been shown to decrease the rate of transmission by 70%. The mother should also be counseled to not breastfeed, as this increases the risk of transmission.\n(Choice A) Elective cesarean section reduces the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV by 50% (less efficacious than zidovudine). Combining zidovudine treatment with elective cesarean section reduces the risk of transmission more than either intervention alone.\n(Choice B) Forceps are to be avoided in this setting, because abrasions ar lacerations of the infant's skin would increase the risk of HIV transmission.\n(Choice C) Administration of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin and vaccine is beneficial for infants barn to mothers with Hepatitis B. Unfortunately, there is no immunoglobulin or vaccine available for HIV.\nEducational objective:\nBy treating HIV-infected women with zidovudine throughout pregnancy and labor, and treating the newborn far the first 6 weeks of life, the risk of HIV transmission is reduced by 70%."

      "H. Candidiasis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Symptoms of pathologic vaginal discharge include a history of pruritus, burning, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Vaginal exam findings which raise suspicion for a pathologic cause include erythema, edema and friability of the vaginal mucosa; tenderness of the cervix; and green or curd-like vaginal discharge. However, copious vaginal discharge by itself is not necessarily pathologic. The amount of vaginal discharge can vary between women, and even a given woman can have significant vanation in the amount of vaginal discharge at different stages of the menstrual cycle. Copious vaginal discharge that is white or yellow in appearance, nonmalaodarous, and occurs in the absence of other symptoms ar findings on vaginal exam is referred to as physiologic leukarrhea (Choice E). It does not require treatment, and women with this condition should receive reassurance. There is no suggestion of abuse in this vignette (Choice A) and the absence of odor, pruritus, and urinary symptoms makes all of the other answer choices (Choices B, C, D, F, G, H) unlikely.\nEducational objective:\nKnow how to differentiate physiologic from pathologic vaginal discharge."

      "C. Dopamine aganist",
      "D. Pulsatile GnRH therapy",
      "E. Invitro fertilization"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to hypothalamic dysfunction, a condition commonly associated with severe life stressors, eating disorders and excessive exercise. In this condition, insufficient pulses of GnRH fram the hypothalamus cause pituitary LH and FSH production to decrease. The imbalance of LH and FSH production causes suppression of ovarian estrogen production and avulation, leading to amenorrhea.\nThe first-line intervention for inducing ovulation in this patient would be to cut down on her life stress and exercise intensity. If this fails, replacing the pulsatile GnRH release should be considered.\n(Choice A) Antiandrogens would not be of benefit here.\n(Choice B) Continuous GnRH therapy desensitizes GnRH signaling pathways, inducing anovulation and amenorrhea. This therapy is used in children with GnRH-dependent precocious puberty and in men and women with sex hormane-dependent tumors (i.e. prostate and breast).\n(Choice C) Hyperprolactinemia can cause amenorrhea with galactarrhea. A dopamine agonist can be used to treat this condition.\n(Choice E) In vitro fertilization is an expensive therapy typically reserved far wamen in whom avulation can not be induced pharmacaologically or in whom other therapies have failed.\nEducational objective:\nAcquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a cause of amenorrhea seen most cammonly in association with significant stressars, eating disorders and excessive exercise. Pulsatile GnRH therapy can induce avulation in these patients."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic preparation possessing estrogen properties, which was widely used between 1947 and 1971 for treatment of threatened abortion. Female offspring of women who used DES during their pregnancy are at increased risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix. These women also exhibit cervical abnormalities (hypoplasia), uterine malformations (T-shaped / small uterine cavity), vaginal adenosis and vaginal septae. Many have difficulty conceiving and maintaining pregnancy. Males exposed in utero are at risk of cryptorchidism, microphallus, hypospadias and testicular hypoplasia.\n(Choices A & B) The most important risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and the vagina is infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV).\n(Choice C) Risk factors for endometrial adenocarcinoma include obesity, nulliparity, late menopause, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic unopposed estrogen stimulation and chronic tamoxifen use.\n(Choice D) Ovarian cancers of any type are not related to DES exposure. Risk factors far ovarian cancer include family history, nulliparity and lack of prior aral contraceptive use.\nEducational objective:\nFemale offspring of women wha ingested diethylstilbestrol during their pregnancy are at increased risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix as well as cervical anomalies and uterine malformations."

Adverse effects associated with anabalic steroid abuse include acne, erythrocytasis, gynecomastia, azoospermia, decreased testicular size, cholestasis, hepatic failure and dyslipidemia. Behavioral effects include aggressiveness and psychotic symptoms. The mechanism for azoospermia in men abusing these agents it likely a decrease in GnRH production by the hypothalamus due to feedback inhibition by the exogenous testosterone analog. Decreased GnRH leads to decreased LH and FSH production; LH and FSH are trophic an the testes and are required far normal hormone and sperm production by the testes.\n(Choice A) Klinefelter syndrome [Xx seminiferous tubule dysgenesis) is an inherited disorder characterized by testicular fibrosis (primary hypogonadism), azoospermia, gynecomastia, decreased intelligence and decreased axial skeletal growth.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Lactation alone causes anovulation and therefore some degree of cantraception because the high prolactin levels inhibit the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. Lactation, however is not considered a reliable form of hirth control as ovulation can resume while a mather is still breastfeeding. Contraceptive methods that can be used in the postpartum period include sterilization, barrier methads, intrauterine devices and pragestin-only aral contraceptives. FProgestin-only oral contraceptives are the preferred hormonal contraceptives in lactating women as they do not affect the volume or composition of milk produced by the mother, they have no known effects on the infant and they do nat carry the risk of venous thrombosis associated with combination pills.\n{Choice A) Tubal ligation is an acceptable form of birth cantral following delivery, but the patient described states that she only desires contraception far ane year.\n(Choice B) Combined contraceptive pills may decrease milk production and pass inta the milk. The effects af combination oral contraceptive use on the breastfeeding infant have yet to be determined.\n(Choice C) Caoitus interruptus (withdrawal prior to ejaculation) has very high failure rate and is not considered an effective farm of birth contral under any circumstances.\nEducational objective:\nFrogestin-only oral contraceptives are the preferred farm of hormonal contraception for lactating mothers."

In false labor, contractions are felt in the lower abdomen, are irregular, occur at an interval that does not shorten and do not increase in intensity. In the last manth of pregnancy, patients may experience contractions that become rhythmic, occurring every 10 to 20 minutes, and contractions of greater intensity, mimicking more closely the contractions of actual labor. In all cases of false labar, however, contractions are not accompanied by progressive cervical changes and are usually relieved by sedation.\n(Choice A) True labor is characterized by contractions that accur at regular intervals with a progressively shortening interval and increasing intensity. The pain in true labar occurs in the back and upper abdomen and is not relieved by sedation. Cervical changes are typically observed.\n(Choices B & D) In the setting of premature labor, corticosteroids should be administered to promate fetal lung maturity and tocolysis should be accomplished to allow the corticosteroids at least 48 hours for full effectiveness.\n(Choice C) Fenicillin is indicated in mathers who are determined ta be carriers of group B streptococcus or those wha have syphilis.\nEducational objective:\nIn false labar, progressive cervical changes are absent, contractions are irregular and discomfort is readily relieved by sedation.

      "E. Postpartum hemarrhage"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient's urine culture shows evidence of infection, but the patient is asymptomatic; therefore, this is considered as a case of asymptomatic bacteriuria. A positive urine culture ( >= 100,000 colony-forming units per ml of a single organism in a midstream, clean catch urine sample) confirms the diagnosis. Pregnancy is a risk factor for developing urinary tract infections due to stasis of urine, owing to compression by the enlarging uterus, as well as smooth muscle relaxation caused by progesterone. Asymptomatic bacteriuria, if untreated, may progress ta pyelonephritis in 30-40% cases. Pyelonephritis may cause septicemia, preterm labor and low birth weight babies; hence, it is very important to detect and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria ar an avert urine infection in pregnancy. Amaxicillin, ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are commonly used to treat the patients.\n(Choice A) Chorinamnionitis is seen as a result of preterm labar, intrauterine instrumentation, sexually transmitted diseases and prolonged labor.\n(Choice B) Endometritis is commanly seen as a result of pelvic inflammatory disease due to STDs, infections such as tuberculosis, instrumentation of the genital tract, and after a caesarean delivery.\n{Choices C and E) Difficult labor due to fetal macrosomia and postpartum hemorrhage are complications seen in diabetic patients. This patient has a normal glucose tolerance test (<140 magfdL is normal), and is therefore unlikely to suffer these complications.\nEducational Objective:\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria occurs when the urine culture grows >=100,000 CFU per ml of a single organism in an asymptomatic patient. It is important to promptly treat the infection to prevent progression ta pyelonephritis in the pregnant patient."

    "question": "A 16-year-old female comes to the emergency department because of heavy vaginal bleeding. She has no pain. Since menarche, menses have been irregular. She has a steady boyfriend and uses condoms for contraception. She has no other medical problems. She does not use alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. Her temperature is 37C (99F), blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination shows active vaginal bleeding. Pregnancy test is negative. Coagulation studies are within normal limits. Ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin is 9.8 g/dL and hematocrit is 29%. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Emergency dilatation and curettage",
      "B. Packed red blood cell transfusion",
      "C. High dose estrogen therapy",
      "D. Hysteroscopy",
      "E. High dose GnRH agonists"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUBE) refers ta heavy vaginal bleeding that occurs in the absence of structural or organic disease. DUB is most often the result of anovulation. This patient's pregnancy testis negative and her physical exam and ultrasound are normal, suggesting a diagnosis of DUB. In adolescent females with DUB, the proper treatment depends on the severity of bleeding. If DUB is mild, then iran supplementation is sufficient. If DUB is moderate and there is no active bleeding, then progestin should be added. If DUB is moderate with active bleeding, or if DUB is severe then estrogen is indicated (Choice C).\n(Choices A & B) Emergency dilation and curettage to control bleeding and packed red blood cell transfusion to replete hemoglobin would be indicated if this patient were hemodynamically unstable secondary to vaginal bleeding. However these steps are not indicated given her hemaglobin of >= 8 and the absence of symptoms secondary to anemia.\n(Choice D) Hysteroscopy would be indicated for removal of endometrial polyps or uterine fibroids. However, an ultrasound showing no abnormalities suggests that this girl is experiencing DUB, which does not require hysteroscopy.\n(Choice E) GnRH agonists may be used to suppress symptoms from endometriosis and uterine fibroids. However, in active DUB, high dose estrogen therapy is the appropriate treatment.\nEducational objective:\nDUB is the most common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and is most aften due to anovulation. High dose estrogen is the management of choice for uncontrolled bleeding. In wamen >=35 with DUB, endometrial biopsy is indicated."

      "E. She is at risk of ovarian cancer"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cral contraceptive pills (OCPs) offer both risks and benefits. The risks associated with OCP use include venous thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, breast cancer, cervical cancer, ↑ triglycerides, hypertension (Choice B) and worsening of diabetes. The relative risk of developing hypertension in patients taking OCPFs is 1.8. compared to non-users, and patients with pre-existing hypertension are likely to experience a mild increase in blood pressure. The mechanism of ↑ BP involves sodium and water retention. OCF use decreases the risk of endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ectopic pregnancy.\n(Choices A & E) OCF use decreases the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.\n(Choice C) The incidence of benign breast disease decreased with OCF use.\n(Choice D) OCPs have been shown to cause a mild increase in insulin resistance. However, OCPs have not been shown to precipitate diabetes in non-diabetic patients.\nEducational objective:\nQOCPs offer both risks and benefits as outlined below. The risks and benefits should be weighed carefully for each individual patient.\nRisks: Venous thromboembalism, Cardiovascular events/stroke, Elevation of triglyceride levels, Chalestasis or cholecystitis, Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension\nBenefits: Protection against Ovarian cysts and cancer, Endometrial cancer, Benign breast disease, Dysmenarrhea (anemia)"

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient mast likely has a pseudocyesis. This is an uncommon condition in which a woman presents with many signs and symptoms of pregnancy such as amenorrhea, enlargement of the breasts and abdomen, morning sickness, weight gain, sensation of fetal movement and reported positive urine pregnancy test per the patient. Ultrasound, however, will reveal a normal endometrial stripe and the pregnancy test in affice will be negative. Pseudocyesis is usually seen in women who have a strong desire to become pregnant. It has been suggested that the depression caused by this need is behind the occurrence of some hormonal changes mimicking those of pregnancy. This is a form of conversion disorder, and management requires psychiatric evaluation and treatment.\n(Choice A) In a missed abortion ultrasonogram usually reveal an intrauterine collapsed gestational sac and absent fetal cardiac activity. An in office pregnancy test is positive.\n{Choice B) Fetal demise occurs between 20 weeks gestation and the onset of labor. Ultrasonogram reveals an absence of fetal heart activity and the presence of intrauterine products of conception.\n(Choice C) In ectopic pregnancy ultrasonagram usually reveals an adnexal mass and an empty uterus. A pregnancy test will be positive.\n(Choice D) Patients with malar pregnancy typically have an exaggeration of the nausea and vamiting of early pregnancy, uterine size greater than dates and ultrasound typically reveals the classic snowstorm appearance. A pregnancy test will be positive.\n(Choice F) Beta-HCG would be positive by this time in a pregnancy.\n{Choice G) Anorexia nervosa can cause amenorrhea due to nutritional deficiency, but ather signs and symptoms of pregnancy da not typically occur.\n(Choice H) Hypothyroidism is a cause of amenorrhea, but other signs of hypothyroidism such as weakness, cold intolerance, canstipation, hoarseness, dry skin and delayed DTHs would likely be present.\nEducational objective:\nPseudocyesis is a rare psychiatric candition in which a waman presents with nearly all signs and symptoms af pregnancy; however, ultrasound reveals a normal endometrial stripe and negative pregnancy test."

      "D. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for 7 days",
      "E. Obtain renal ultrasonogram"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has asymptomatic bacteriuria of pregnancy. Left untreated, asymptomatic bacteriuria can lead to cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, preterm birth and increased perinatal mortality. Therefore, all pregnant patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (>=100,000 organisms/mL) should be treated with antibiotics. Accepted regimens include nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin, ar a first generation cephalosporin far 7 days. Shorter courses (3 days) are sufficient for treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in non-pregnant patients. However, 3 days of antibiotics are ineffective at eradicating asymptomatic bacteriuria of pregnancy.\n{Choice B) Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is associated with cartilage abnormalities in the fetus and should not be prescribed to pregnant patients. Furthermore, 3 days is an insufficient length of therapy for this condition.\n{Choice D) A 3-day course of TMP-SMX is a common choice for management of uncomplicated cystitis. However, trimethoprim should be avoided during pregnancy because it is a folate antagonist.\n(Choice E) Asymptomatic bacteriuria of pregnancy does not require an ultrasonogram.\n(Choice C) Because of the risks to the mother (cystitis, pyelonephritis) and infant (low birth weight and increased perinatal mortality) reassurance and routine follow-up are inappropriate in cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria of pregnancy.\nEducational objective:\nIn pregnant patients, asymptomatic bacteriuria increases the risk of cystitis, pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality. Escherichia coli accounts for mare than 70% of cases. Treatment in pregnancy consists af a 7-day course of nitrofurantain, amaxicillin ar a first-generation cephalosparin."
