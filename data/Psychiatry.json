NMS is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with antipsychotics, and is more commonly associated with the use of high-potency, typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. Treatment includes discontinuation of all antipsychotics, aggressive monitoring in the ICU, control of hyperthermia, and maintenance of electrolyte balance. Dantrolene is a skeletal muscle relaxant that may be used to relieve symptoms in severe cases. Mortality from NMS is high, approaching 10-20%.\nThis patient has fever, mental status changes, and rigidity, which are most likely the result of repeated doses of haloperidol.\n(Choice A) This patient's head banging may result in an intracranial bleed with subsequent altered mental status, but this would not explain his other symptoms.\n(Choice B) Patients who are physically restrained sometimes have mild elevations of creatinine phosphokinase, which is caused by muscle breakdown as a result of the physical struggle. However, fever, altered mental status, and rigidity would not result from physical restraints.\n(Choice D) The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline can cause serotonin syndrome when given in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Serotonin syndrome can sometimes appear clinically similar to NMS, with high fevers and rigidity. However, it often begins with diarrhea, restlessness, and autonomic instability.\n(Choice E) The patient's symptoms of fever, rigidity, and altered mentation are not related to worsening depression.\nEducational objective:\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur after administration of antipsychotic medications. Symptoms include fever, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability."

        "explanation": "Anorexia nervosa is most common in adolescent girls from affluent families. The DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa include: 1) body weight at least 15% below normal weight, accompanied by a refusal to maintain body weight at normal levels: 2) amenorrhea for three months; 3) distortion of body image in which the individual views herself as obese, when she is in fact thin; and 4) fear of gaining weight or becoming fat despite being underweight. To continue to lose weight, individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa will either: 1) fast and/or exercise (the restricting subtype), or 2) binge eat followed by laxative usage or induced vomiting (the binge and purge subtype).\nOn physical examination of the anorexic patient, the most striking finding is emaciation. Some individuals also develop lanugo (a fine downy body hair) on the back and abdomen. Those anorexics who induce vomiting may have enlarged parotids, dental enamel erosion, and scars or calluses on the hand from contact with the teeth. Other common findings include bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, and dry skin. Electrolyte abnormalities secondary to vomiting are often discovered as well.\n(Choice A) Eating disorder, not otherwise specified is the correct diagnosis in patients whose eating disorder does not meet the criteria for specific conditions (eg, a patient who meets the criteria for anorexia nervosa but has regular menses).\n(Choice C) The most prominent features of bulimia nervosa include episodes of binge eating followed by feelings of disgust or guilt, repeated compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain after the binge (eg, induced vomiting, laxative abuse), and a normal or slightly above normal BMI.\n(Choice D) Oppositional defiant disorder is a childhood condition characterized by defiant and hostile behavior. Symptoms are milder than those seen with conduct disorder.\n(Choice E) Somatization disorder is characterized by physical symptoms or complaints that have no organic basis.\nEducational Objective:\nAnorexia nervosa is always associated with amenorrhea and a body weight that is below normal. Bulimia nervosa, in contrast, is associated with normal menses and body weight."

The patient experiences marked distress in excess of what would be expected from exposure to the stressor. In this scenario, the woman's anxiety arising from the minor car accident is far greater than would be expected, as evidenced by her quitting her job, drinking to excess, and avoiding social situations. Therefore, the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is appropriate.\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorder is often difficult to differentiate from major depression because of an overlap in symptoms. Although this patient meets the depression criteria for symptom duration (two weeks or more), she does not have five or more symptoms of major depression.\n(Choice B) Patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) persistently re-experience the traumatic event in the form of recurrent nightmares and flashbacks. Places, people, or activities that are reminders of the trauma are avoided. Anhedonia, social detachment, and hypervigilance are common, and difficulties with sleep and concentration may arise. Symptoms must be present for longer than one month.\n(Choice C) Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various different events and activities. Occurring most every day for at least six months, symptoms include three or more of the following: restlessness easy fatigue irritability, poor concentration, and sleep disturbance.\n(Choice D) Acute stress disorder presents with the same symptoms observed in PTSD, but the symptoms are present for less than four weeks.\nEducational Objective:\nAdjustment disorder results in marked distress in excess of what is expected from exposure to the triggering stressor."

Individuals suffering from kleptomania periodically develop significant tension that is alleviated by stealing. The condition is more prevalent in females and is occasionally associated with bulimia nervosa, and can have a chronic or sporadic course.\n(Choice A) Borderline personality disorder is characterized by marked impulsivity and a pattern of unstable relationships. Individuals with the condition oscillate between extremes of idealization and devaluation of others. They frequently indulge in self-mutilation and may make suicidal gestures. Because there is no indication that these features are present in the woman in this scenario, borderline personality disorder is an unlikely diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of repetitive and persistent behavior in which the basic rules of society and the rights of others are violated. Individuals with this condition are at least 18 years of age and have had conduct disorder in childhood.\n(Choice C) Conduct disorder is a childhood behavioral problem that presents in a similar fashion to antisocial personality disorder. Children suffering from this disorder lie, steal, destroy property, set fires, and are cruel to animals and people.\n(Choice D) Manic episodes are characterized by abnormally expansive mood, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, flight of ideas, talkativeness, and increased involvement in pleasurable activities that have the potential for painful consequences (eg, spending exorbitant amounts of money, gambling, sexual indiscretion). The woman in this scenario derives pleasure from stealing items of little significance but does not demonstrate any of the other behaviors required to make a diagnosis of a mania.\nEducational Objective:\nKleptomania is characterized by an inability to resist the impulse to steal objects that either are of low monetary value or are not needed for personal use.

        "options": [
            "A. Acting out",
            "B. Displacement",
            "C. Dissociation",
            "D. Rationalization",
            "E. Conversion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Defense mechanisms are an unconscious attempt to reduce anxiety and adjust to a stressful situation. To minimize anxiety, the ego learns to distort internal reality or the perception of external reality. Defense mechanisms can be destructive if overused or if used at the wrong time.\nIn this scenario, the engineer is upset about being fired from his job of twenty years. He reacts to the situation by turning his anger on his wife when he comes home. He has thus displaced his negative emotions onto his wife, who he considers a \"safer\" target than his employer.\n(Choice A) An immature defense mechanism, acting out is the expression of an unconscious impulse through a physical action. An example would be this engineer screaming and kicking the floor when he discovered he was fired.\n(Choice C) A neurotic defense mechanism, dissociation involves blocking off disturbing thoughts or feelings from consciousness in an attempt to avoid emotional upset. An example would be this engineer blocking out the fact that he was fired, with his wife discovering the truth only when a concerned friend calls from work to give her condolences.\n(Choice D) A neurotic defense mechanism, rationalization is the offering of a rational, logical reason for an upsetting event rather than the real reason. An example would be this engineer stating that being fired was a \"blessing in disguise,\" as he can now spend more time with his family.\n(Choice E) Conversion is a defense mechanism in which emotional conflicts are transformed into physical (often neurological) symptoms. An example would be this engineer being struck mute after learning the news of his firing.\nEducational Objective:\nDisplacement is an immature defense mechanism in which the individual displaces negative feelings associated with an unacceptable object or situation onto a \"safer\" object or situation."

        "question": "A 27-year-old Caucasian male is brought to the emergency department by police officers. The man was found naked at a traffic signal, cursing at drivers and assaulting nearby pedestrians. He has a long history of palysubstance abuse and has been admitted several times to the hospital with a similar presentation each time. Attempts to elicit history from the patient prove unsuccessful, as he is highly agitated and combative. He keeps repeating, \"They are all out to get me. They are coming through the walls, ready to kill me!\" Vital signs include temperature of 36.5C (97.8F), blood pressure of 148/100 mm Hg, pulse of 84/min, and respirations of 16/min. Physical examination reveals ataxia, nystagmus, and muscle rigidity. This patient's presentation is mast consistent with intoxication with which of the following drugs?",

            "A. Alcohol",
            "B. Heroin",
            "C. Lysergic acid (LSD)",
            "D. Phencyclidine (PCP)",
            "E. Cocaine"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Patients with PCP intoxication usually present with distinct behavioral changes such as physical aggression, severe agitation, impulsivity, impaired judgment, psychosis, paranoia, or hallucinations. These symptoms develop shortly after ingestion of the drug. Physical signs such as nystagmus, hypertension, tachycardia, ataxia, dysarthria, muscle rigidity, seizures, or coma may also be evident.\n(Choice A) Alcohol intoxication can also present with ataxia, nystagmus, aggression, and impaired judgment. However, hallucinations are more commonly a feature of alcohol withdrawal, not alcohol intoxication.\n(Choice B) Heroin intoxication would present with pinpoint pupils, drowsiness, CNS depression, and constipation.\n(Choice C) LSD is a hallucinogen. Shortly after ingesting this drug, individuals may experience mood impairment, hallucinations, subjective perceptual intensification (ie, colors are richer, tastes are heightened, and sensation is enhanced), depersonalization, and illusions. In addition, two or more of the following signs are often present: sweating, tachycardia, pupillary dilatation, palpitations, tremors, and poor coordination.\n(Choice E) Cocaine intoxication presents with anxiety, aggression, agitation, psychosis, or delirium. Physical findings may include high or low blood pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, sweating, pupillary dilatation, nausea or vomiting, or insomnia. Overdoses can cause cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, seizures, or stroke. Infrequently, patients present with formication (also known as \"cocaine bugs\"), in which the individual is convinced there are bugs crawling all over him. Nosebleeds and septal perforation can occur in patients who snort cocaine.\nEducational Objective:\nPCP and LSD intoxication present similarly, but agitation and aggression occur more often in patients using PCP. Visual hallucinations and intensified perceptions are hallmarks of LSD use."

        "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found in the park talking to himself. When authorities asked him ta leave, he became agitated and combative, saying he was \"destined to lead\" and has to \"wait in the park for the sign.\" After calming down a little during the evaluation, he admits ta not sleeping for the past week. His thoughts jump from topic to topic, and he is highly distractible. The patient is admitted to the hospital and started on daily haloperidal and carbamazepine. Over the next week, he becomes significantly calmer. Although he continues to have beliefs that he will \"lead a spiritual revolution” he is sleeping six hours a night and is better able to focus. Ten days after admission, he fails to come out of his room for breakfast. The nursing staff find him lying in bed, confused, sweating, and stiff. Vital signs are temperature 39.2°C (102.6°F), blood pressure 164/98 mmHg, pulse 122/min, and respiratory rate 28/min. Which of the following medications would be most appropriate to administer at this time?",
        "options": [
            "A. Benztropine",
            "B. Dantrolene",

            "E. Propranolal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient has neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a relatively uncommon but potentially lethal side effect caused by antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medications, in this case haloperidol. It may occur at any time during treatment with dopamine antagonists. The cardinal features of NMS include hyperthermia, autonomic instability, muscular rigidity, and altered sensorium. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated CPK levels. Rhabdomyolysis, followed by myoglobinuria that can cause acute renal failure, is a known complication. Treatment of NMS includes prompt discontinuation of the responsible neuroleptic agent followed by supportive care (i.e. aggressive cooling, antipyretics, fluid and electrolyte repletion, and alkaline diuresis in the case of rhabdomyolysis). Specific pharmacologic therapies include dantrolene sodium (which is a direct muscle relaxant), amantadine, and/or the dopamine agonist bromocriptine.\n(Choice A) The anticholinergic medication benztropine can be used to treat antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, but it is not used in the management of NMS.\n(Choice C) Naloxone is used to treat opioid overdose, but has no role in the treatment of NMS.\n(Choice D) Physostigmine is used to reverse toxic CNS effects caused by anticholinergic drugs. It is not used in the treatment of NMS.\n(Choice E) The beta-blocker propranolol can be used to control the hypertension and tachycardia associated with NMS, but it would not address the cause of these isolated symptoms. Propranolol is sometimes used to treat the antipsychotic side effect akathisia.\nEducational objective:\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an unusual but potentially lethal side effect from the use of antipsychotics (neuroleptics). It is treated primarily with dantrolene sodium and supportive care."

        "question": "A middle-aged, divorced woman brings her 17-year-old daughter ta the physician with the complaint that her daughter \"seems abnormal \". She is concerned because her daughter has no close friends and does not date. The mather adds that she has to be particularly careful of comments she makes because her daughter is especially sensitive to criticism. Otherwise, the mother reports, her daughter is very polite, well behaved, and earns excellent grades in high school. When questioned about her behavior, the daughter breaks down in tears and says, \"The reality is no one wants to be friends with someone ugly and stupid like me.\" Which of the following personality disorders is demonstrated by the girl's behavior?",
        "options": [
            "A. Schizoid personality disorder",
            "B. Dependent personality disarder",
            "C. Schizotypal personality disorder",
            "D. Avoidant personality disorder",
            "E. Borderline personality disorder"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This patient is socially isolated, hypersensitive to criticism, and lacks self-esteem. Her tearful reply to the physician's inquiry suggests that she is unhappy with her situation and would like to make friends but fears being humiliated or rejected. Her presentation is therefore suggestive of avoidant personality disorder, a condition in which individuals consider themselves inferior to others and avoid participating in new activities or taking risks for fear of being embarrassed.\n(Choice A) Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by social detachment and a restricted range of expressed emotion. These patients do not enjoy close relationships with others and prefer to be aloof and isolated. They rarely indulge in any pleasurable activities and appear indifferent to praise or criticism. They are able to recognize reality, however, and do not demonstrate the bizarre cognition or psychosis that would be consistent with schizophrenia.\n(Choice B) Individuals with dependent personality disorder have an excessive need to be cared for and tend to be clingy and submissive with loved ones. They are usually indecisive and avoid taking the initiative because of feelings of inadequacy. They have difficulty expressing disagreement with others for fear of losing support, and they dread being left alone to fend for themselves.\n(Choice C) Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior and a reduced capacity for close relationships. These patients usually exhibit \"magical thinking\" that is inconsistent with cultural norms. They may have bizarre fantasies or believe in telepathy, clairvoyance, or the concept of a sixth sense.\n(Choice E) Individuals with borderline personality disorder show a pattern of instability in relationships and marked impulsivity. They swing wildly between scorning and idealizing people (with others considered wholly good or wholly bad, a phenomenon known as \"splitting\"). They tend to be impulsive and reckless and may demonstrate suicidal or self-mutilating behavior. Feelings of anger and chronic emptiness are common.\nEducational Objective:\nAvoidant personality disorder is characterized by shyness, feelings of inferiority, and a desire to make friends that is overridden by an intense fear of embarrassment or rejection."

He states, \"l could get a job if | wanted to, but why should I?\" The man has also been arrested several times for larceny and drug possession. He did not complete high schoal because he was suspended for repeated truancy and fighting with peers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": [
            "A. Antisocial personality disorder",
            "B. Borderline personality disorder",
            "C. Conduct disorder",
            "D. Histrionic disorder",
            "E. Narcissistic disarder"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, which typically begins by middle adolescence and continues into adulthood. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder routinely engage in illegal activities (e.g. drug use, assault, or theft), endanger the well-being of others, and frequently lie. They tend to be aggressive and impulsive, and have difficulty maintaining employment. Despite these features, however, affected individuals frequently display a superficial charm that allows for the manipulation of others.\n(Choice B) Individuals with borderline personality disorder often show a pattern of instability in relationships and can be impulsive and/or reckless. However, they also have identity disturbance, recurrent suicidal or self-mutilating behavior, and feelings of emptiness, none of which this patient has. Therefore, antisocial personality disorder is a much more appropriate diagnosis.\n(Choice C) Children and adolescents with conduct disorder often became adults with antisocial personality disorder. The diagnosis of conduct disorder requires at least three symptoms from the following categories: aggression towards people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or a serious violation of rules. However, if someone qualifies for the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, they no longer have conduct disorder.\n(Choice D) Individuals with histrionic personality disorder demonstrate excessively labile emotions and attention-seeking behavior, which is not observed in this patient.\n(Choice E) Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder often have an exaggerated sense of self importance, demonstrate arrogant behavior, and lack empathy for others. However, they usually do not break the law and are not violent towards others.\nEducational objective:\nAntisocial personality disorder is diagnosed in patients aged 18 years or older who engage in illegal activities (e.g. theft or assault) and disregard the rights of others. These individuals often display evidence of conduct disorder as minors."

        "question": "A 43-year-old male with a long history of schizophrenia is hospitalized for recurrent auditory hallucinations and delusions. He says that he hears voices coming from his radio warning about the \"secret government agents\" that hunt far him. He is certain that his next-door neighbor is spying on him and listening through the wall on behalf of the government. His sister tells the attending physician that the patient lives by himself and has been treated with risperidone for several years. Because of repeated episodes of noncompliance with his medication, he has experienced multiple relapses that required hospitalization. He was most recently discharged from the hospital twa months ago. Which of these would be the antipsychotic of choice for the long-term treatment of this patient?",
        "options": [
            "A. Thioridazine",
            "B. Fluphenazine",
            "C. Quetiapine",
            "D. Fluoxetine",
            "E. Clozapine"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Treatment noncompliance in schizophrenic patients is common and results from several factors. Patients who live by themselves, who have poor social support systems, who are elderly, or who have developed side effects with the use of neuroleptics are all more likely to be noncompliant with their medications. This noncompliance leads to symptom exacerbation, relapse, and recurrent hospitalization. It is therefore recommended that schizophrenic patients with a history of noncompliance be given long-acting injectable antipsychotics such as fluphenazine or haloperidol. When administered in an outpatient setting at regularly scheduled intervals (usually twice per month), high doses of injectable antipsychotics allow for better symptom control and circumvent the issue of poor medication adherence.\n(Choices A, C, and E) These antipsychotics are taken orally and would therefore most likely result in a continuing pattern of noncompliance. It would be preferable to periodically administer an injectable antipsychotic on an outpatient basis instead.\nEducational Objective:\nDepot antipsychotics such as fluphenazine and haloperidol are the treatment of choice for schizophrenic patients who suffer relapses due to treatment noncompliance."

        "question": "A 37-year-old male patient with a history of bipolar affective disarder with psychasis is accompanied ta clinic by his wife. He is a known patient and has been treated for the past three years with lithium and risperidone. His wife states that her husband's symptoms are remarkably well managed with the medications, but she is concerned about some new, abnormal movements that he has recently begun to make. While being physically examined, the man repeatedly protrudes his tongue and smacks his lips. There are also some abnormal rolling movements of his fingers. Which of the following is the patient most likely experiencing?",
        "options": [
            "A. Akathisia",
            "B. Tardive dyskinesia",

            "D. Parkinsonism",
            "E. Lithium side effects"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Antipsychotics are classified as typical and atypical. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) occur frequently as side effects of typical antipsychotics but may also occasionally occur with the use of atypical antipsychotics. This patient has developed tardive dyskinesia as a side effect of risperidone usage. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary perioral movements such as biting, chewing, grimacing, and tongue protrusions. Involuntary choreoathetoid movements of the head, limbs, and trunk may also be observed. The condition usually arises after four months and before four years of treatment, and may be irreversible. Risperidone is the atypical antipsychotic most likely to cause EPS, while clozapine is the atypical antipsychotic least likely to cause EPS. Therefore, tardive dyskinesia is best managed by immediately discontinuing the offending antipsychotic and replacing it with clozapine. Because clozapine is associated with agranulocytosis, it is typically considered to be a medication of last resort.\n(Choice A) Akathisia is a subjective feeling of restlessness that compels patients to constantly move around. It can occur at any time during treatment with antipsychotics. Beta-blockers provide some relief.\n(Choice C) Dystonia can occur at any time between four hours and four days after receiving an antipsychotic medication. The condition is characterized by muscle spasms or stiffness, tongue protrusion or twisting, opisthotonus, and oculogyric crisis. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or anticholinergics such as benztropine provide relief.\n(Choice D) Parkinsonism can also occur, developing between four days and four months after receiving an antipsychotic medication. It presents with cogwheel rigidity, masked facies, bradykinesis, pill-rolling finger tremors, and shuffling gait. Treatment is with anticholinergics such as benztropine.\n(Choice E) Although lithium can cause tremors, it does not cause involuntary perioral movements. It is therefore an unlikely diagnosis in this patient.\nEducational Objective:\nThe extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) frequently seen with typical antipsychotics include dystonia, Parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The atypical antipsychotic medication most likely to cause EPS is risperidone. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary perioral movements such as biting, chewing, grimacing, and tongue protrusions."

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Borderline personality disorder is classified as Cluster B (dramatic, emotional) and is characterized by a pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships and marked impulsivity. Patients with this condition swing wildly between devaluing and idealizing others, labeling people as wholly good or wholly bad--a phenomenon popularly known as \"splitting.\" Borderline patients frequently demonstrate suicidal or self-mutilating behavior. Their moods tend to be unpredictable, and they have difficulty controlling anger. Chronic feelings of emptiness are common.\n(Choice A) Antisocial personality disorder is classified as Cluster B (dramatic, emotional) and is characterized by a pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others. People with this disorder repeatedly lie and engage in unlawful activities. They tend to be aggressive and impulsive and may find it difficult to maintain employment for long. Patients must be 18 years or older to be diagnosed with the condition, and typically have a history of conduct disorder in adolescence.\n(Choice B) Histrionic personality disorder is classified as Cluster B (dramatic, emotional) and is characterized by a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking. These patients often use their physical appearance to draw the attention of others and may behave in a sexually provocative manner. They tend to exaggerate and dramatize their emotions, which otherwise lack depth.\n(Choice C) Paranoid personality disorder is classified as Cluster A (odd, eccentric) and is characterized by a pattern of distrust and suspiciousness of others. Patients with this disorder tend to negatively interpret the actions, words, and intentions of others. They suspect that others intend to harm or deceive them, though there may be little supporting evidence for such concerns. They hold grudges for long periods and are reluctant to confide in others.\n(Choice D) Dependent personality disorder is classified as Cluster C (anxious, fearful) and is characterized by clingy and submissive behavior. These patients fear separation and tend to be indecisive and unable to take the initiative. They are often preoccupied with the thought of being left to fend for themselves, and want others to assume responsibility for all major decision making. They have difficulty expressing disagreement because they fear abandonment.\n(Choice F) Narcissistic personality disorder is classified as Cluster B (dramatic, emotional) and is characterized by arrogance, grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a tendency to exploit others. Patients with this condition often have a sense of excessive entitlement and may demand special treatment.\nEducational Objective:\nBorderline personality disorder is characterized by \"splitting,\" unstable relationships, and impulsivity. Angry outbursts and suicidal gestures are common."

She tearfully requests if there is some sart of contraception available after the fact, and adds, \"Doctor, | don't want to get pregnant!\" The prospect of the \"morning after\" pill is discussed, and the girl indicates she is very interested. She begs that her parents not be told about this visit. Given the situation, what is the mast appropriate response?",
        "options": [
            "A. Provide the girl with a contraceptive prescription and then call her mother",

             "E. Decline to provide the prescription unless the mother provides consent"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Most states allow adolescents to consult with physicians about sexually transmitted diseases, contraception, pregnancy, and mental illness without parental consent. Therefore, the girl in this scenario should be given a prescription for oral contraceptives and counseled on safe sex. Such counseling should be provided to all adolescents who present for routine visits.\nEmancipated minors are those adolescents (typically ages 13 and older) who have been legally determined to be independent and therefore able to provide informed consent for any medical treatment. Criteria that may qualify an adolescent for emancipation include marriage, parenthood, serving in the armed forces, financial independence, and living alone. Although the girl in this scenario does not appear to be an emancipated minor, she is nevertheless entitled to confidentiality when discussing concerns about sex or contraception with her physician and can consent to related treatment without parental approval.\n(Choice A) Calling the girl's mother would be considered a breach of confidentiality and is therefore highly inappropriate.\n(Choices C and E) Because the girl's visit is regarding contraception, it is not necessary to relay information to her parents. However, the girl should be encouraged to be more open with her parents about her sexual activity and any associated concerns.\n(Choice D) Criticizing the girl as \"foolish\" is a judgmental response that would likely hamper future communication with her. It is better to establish a trusting, open atmosphere that allows adolescents to reveal potentially embarrassing behaviors.\nEducational Objective:\nAdolescents seeking a physician's care for contraception, prenatal care, sexually transmitted diseases, or substance abuse may be treated without parental consent and are entitled to strict patient confidentiality."

The tics occur many times a day (frequently in bouts) nearly every day or at regular intervals for at least one year. The motor tics frequently observed include grimacing, eye blinking, nose twitching, head jerking, and shoulder shrugging. The vocal tics include barking, grunting, squeaking, coughing, and throat clearing. In a minority of cases, coprolalia may be observed. Symptoms are exacerbated by stress and tend to subside during sleep.\nFrequent comorbid conditions in this patient population include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (60 percent) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (27 percent).

        "question": "A 42-year-old Caucasian man is brought to the emergency department by police officers after he was found wandering aimlessly at the Washington Dulles International Airport. The man appears to be confused about his identity and his whereabouts. Extensive inquiry fails to reveal any helpful information, as the patient does nat remember his name, his family members, his profession, where he lives, or how he came to be at the airport. A search of his personal belongings reveals an airline ticket from Las Vegas to Washington, D.C. Physical examination is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": [
            "A. Dissociative identity disorder",
            "B. Dissociative amnesia",
            "C. Depersonalization disorder",
            "D. Dissociative fugue",
            "E. Malingering",
            "F. Derealization disorder"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The man in this scenario appears to be suffering from a dissociative fugue (from the Latin word fugere, meaning \"flight\"). Evidence in support of this diagnosis includes his sudden and unexpected travel, his inability to remember his past, and his confusion about his personal identity. At times, patients with this condition will assume new identities altogether.\n(Choice A) Dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder, is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct identities that alternatively assume control of the person's behavior. Amnesia regarding important personal information about some of the identities is observed.\n(Choice B) Dissociative amnesia is characterized by the presence of one or more episodes of inability to recall important personal information. The memory disturbance is usually related to a traumatic or stressful event and is too extensive to be considered ordinary forgetfulness. In this patient, his history of recent travel suggests that dissociative fugue is the more likely diagnosis.\n(Choice C) Depersonalization disorder is characterized by persistent or recurrent feelings of detachment from one's own physical or mental processes in the context of an intact sense of reality. These patients tend to feel they are observing their body and thoughts from afar, as if they are living in a dream. This condition usually results in significant occupational or functional impairment.\n(Choice E) Malingering is characterized by the intentional production of false physical symptoms or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological complaints for the purpose of secondary gain (eg, financial compensation, avoidance of work, or obtaining narcotics). There is usually a marked disparity between the patient's stated disability and the objective findings. In this patient, there is no evidence of secondary gain, and his history of recent travel is more suggestive of dissociative fugue.\n(Choice F) Derealization disorder describes the state of experiencing familiar persons and surroundings as if they were strange or unreal.\nEducational Objective:\nThe dissociative disorders are characterized by forgetfulness and dissociation. Dissociative fugue is the only condition within this group that is associated with travel."

        "question": "A 31-year-old female accountant returns to the psychiatrist for a monthly follow-up examination. She states that far the past two weeks, she has felt wanderful and very energetic despite getting little sleep at night. She has alsa naticed a significant improvement in her libido and has begun dating several men. She proudly confides that she will be promoted to the company's board of directors by the end of the month and outlines her future plans for the business, which include buying out all of the competitors and immediately expanding the product line. She has also made arrangements to purchase an expensive yacht so that she can begin hosting parties for her business associates. Past medical histary is unremarkable except for an episode of major depression last year. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is made, and the need for long-term therapy with lithium carbonate is discussed. Which of the following laboratory tests should be performed before initiating treatment with lithium?",
        "options": [
            "A. Complete blood count and creatinine",
            "B. Complete blood count and liver function tests",
            "C. Complete blood count and thyroid function tests",
            "D. Creatinine and liver function tests",
            "E. Creatinine and thyroid function tests",
            "F. Liver function tests and thyroid function tests"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The long-term treatment of choice for bipolar disorder is either lithium carbonate or valproic acid. The therapeutic effects of lithium carbonate are attributed to its ability to inhibit inositol-1-phosphatase in neurons. Because the margin of safety for lithium is very low, frequent monitoring is required to avoid toxicity. The potential adverse effects associated with lithium usage include gastrointestinal distress (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain), nephrotoxicity (resulting in polyuria and polydipsia, ultimately leading to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), hypothyroidism, leukocytosis, tremors, acne, psoriasis flares, hair loss, and edema. Lithium is also a teratogen that is associated with Ebstein's anomaly (a cardiac defect). In a young woman, it is therefore important to evaluate thyroid function, renal function, and human chorionic gonadotropin levels before prescribing lithium.\n(Choices A, B, C, D, and F) Since lithium does not have any adverse effects on the functionality of the liver or bone marrow, obtaining liver function tests or a complete blood count is unnecessary.\nEducational objective:\nSome of the more serious adverse effects associated with lithium include nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, and Ebstein's anomaly in the fetus."

She feels compelled to repeatedly rewrite her lecture nates and essays in an effort to make them perfect, though she is never satisfied with the result. She also spends several hours per day in the shower and washes her hands multiple times after they are dirtied in arder to stay clean. She refuses to shake hands with strangers for fear of becoming \"contaminated with germs.\" Which of the following neurotransmitters is most invalved in the pathogenesis of this woman's condition?",

            "E. GABA"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This woman's behavior is highly suggestive of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). According to the DSM-IV, OCD is characterized by the presence of persistent, intrusive thoughts that lead to the performance of compulsive acts in order to allay inherent anxieties. Individuals suffering from this order often perform multiple time-wasting rituals and recognize the absurdity of their behavior but feel unable to stop. They suffer from significant functional impairment.\nThis disorder results from altered levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, aggression, and impulsivity. The treatment of choice for OCD is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as paroxetine.\nEducational Objective:\nAltered levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin play an important role in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder."

        "question": "A 36-year-old male with a known diagnosis of bipolar disorder presents to the emergency department in the midst of an acute manic episode. He has been treated with valproate far the past six months He is accompanied by his wife, who informs the attending physician that the patient has taken his medication anly sporadically. The man is then hospitalized and his valproate restarted after his serum level is checked and found to be low. While the patient is in the psychiatric ward, olanzapine is added ta his treatment regimen. He stabilizes aver a period of four days and is discharged home. Upon discharge, his wife asks far more information about this new medication. Which of the following significant side effects is most commonly seen with olanzapine?",
        "options": [

            "E. Postural hypatension"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia. It is also effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder, either alone or in conjunction with mood stabilizers. There are multiple significant side effects associated with its use, with weight gain being the most common.\n(Choice A) Diabetes mellitus is a concerning side effect of olanzapine, as is dyslipidemia. It is not observed as often as weight gain or obesity, however.\n(Choice C) Extrapyramidal side effects are unusual in patients taking atypical antipsychotics. Therefore, dystonia is not a common side effect of olanzapine.\n(Choice D) Agranulocytosis is of concern in patients who take clozapine, not olanzapine.\n(Choice E) Postural hypotension does occur as an occasional side effect of olanzapine, but it is not as common as weight gain.\nEducational Objective:\nWeight gain is a significant adverse effect associated with olanzapine."

        "question": "A 44-year-old psychology professar with a chronic history of rheumatoid arthritis presents for a follow-up examination. She is currently taking prednisone and infliximab, a regimen that has successfully stabilized her condition. Physical examination reveals no significant changes. Toward the end of the visit, she mentions that she would like to try acupuncture as an adjunct treatment in addition to the medications she is currently taking.

            "E. \"How can an educated woman like you suggest something like this?\""
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All patients enjoy the right to select treatment plans based on their personal values or preferences. When a patient expresses interest in alternative medicine, the physician should inquire about the reasons for departing from traditional treatments. It is important to determine if the patient is dissatisfied with the quality of her current care or if she is suffering from a bothersome side effect. Therefore, it would be most appropriate to ask this patient why she is interested in acupuncture as an adjunct treatment.\n(Choice A) Because alternative medicine is enjoying increasing popularity, physicians have the obligation to become familiar with the most commonly used non-traditional therapies, their side effects, and any potential drug interactions. In this instance, the physician must be prepared to discuss acupuncture and any contraindications or adverse effects were it to be added to her treatment regimen.\n(Choice B) The physician should encourage the patient to obtain relevant literature and educational information about acupuncture from reliable sources. This should not be recommended in an attempt to instill fear into the patient, but instead to enable the patient to make well-informed decisions. If the physician is already aware of potentially harmful interactions, the patient should be told about them. The first step, however, is to discover why the patient is interested in adding this alternative therapy to the treatment regimen.\n(Choice C) The physician should not abandon a patient who is interested in exploring an alternative treatment. Instead, the patient's preferences should be respected and the patient encouraged to learn more about the available options.\n(Choice E) Ridiculing the patient for an interest in alternative therapy will inevitably undermine all future doctor-patient communication. Instead, physicians should encourage patients to keep them informed about any alternative treatments undertaken. Physicians should also seek to educate themselves about the more popular alternative medicines so that they can properly discuss potential side effects or drug interactions with patients.\nEducational Objective:\nWhen a patient is interested in alternative therapy, the physician should first inquire as to why."

        "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought in to clinic by her mother, who complains that her daughter has lost 15 lbs (6.8 kg) in the past three months. The mother says she is \"extremely frustrated” with her daughter because she refuses to eat with the family and insists on cooking her awn non-fat meals. The girl is a high school varsity athlete and devotes a minimum of three hours per day to her physical training. The mother says that in every other aspect, her daughter is \"ideal, very well behaved and earning excellent grades.\" When the girl is asked about her situation, she responds by saying \"| think I'm just fine, except for all that flab an my abdomen.\" The girl's past medical history is significant for infectious mononucleosis at 11 years of age. Her menstrual cycles are regular. She does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohal, or use recreational drugs. She takes no medications and has na drug allergies. Her height is 5'4\" (165 cm) and her weight is 100 Ibs (45.3 kg). Vital signs include temperature of 36.0C {97 5F), blood pressure of 98/76 mm Hyg, pulse of 70/min, and respirations of 14/min. Physical examination reveals calluses an the dorsal surface of the right hand. Inspection of the oral cavity demonstrates enamel erosion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

            "A. Eating disorder, not otherwise specified",
            "B. Anorexia nervosa",
            "C. Bulimia nervosa",
            "D. Conduct disorder",
            "E. Normal adolescent behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Eating disorder, not otherwise specified is a DSM-IV category that includes all eating disorders that do not meet the criteria of any one specific eating disorder. For example, a patient may be amenorrheic but otherwise meets criteria for bulimia, which would classify her as having eating disorder, not otherwise specified. The girl in this scenario has an eating disorder that shares features with both anorexia and bulimia in that she has lost weight, has a distorted body image, vomits to induce weight loss, and has normal menses. Since she does not meet the criteria for one specific eating disorder, she would be considered to have eating disorder, not otherwise specified.\n(Choice B) Although the girl in this scenario does have a distorted body image and below normal body weight, the presence of normal menses eliminates anorexia nervosa as the diagnosis.\n(Choice C) Although the girl in this scenario has physical signs of forceful purging (erosion of tooth enamel and calluses on her fingers), her below normal body weight counters bulimia nervosa as the diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Conduct disorder is a persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rules of society and the rights of others are violated. Children suffering from this disorder frequently lie, steal, destroy the property of others, set fires, and demonstrate cruelty to animals and people.\n(Choice E) Adolescents are certainly highly conscious of physical appearance, and most will use some combination of diet and exercise to maintain an ideal body weight. However, this girl's unusually low body weight and habit of purging after meals are not consistent with normal adolescent behavior.\nEducational Objective:\nEating disorder, not otherwise specified is a DSM-IV category that includes all eating disorders that do not meet the criteria for any one specific eating disorder."

Examination finds a number of superficial cuts and a deeper one-centimeter laceration that requires twa sutures. The patient admits to cutting her wrist, but when asked why she did it, she states, \"l don't know.\" She avoids eye contact and looks at the ground for the entire interview. She refuses to answer many questions, but admits to feeling depressed over the past few months. She denies any past psychiatric history. When asked if she would dao something like this again, the patient is quiet for some time, and then shakes her head. When the parents are approached about their daughter, they state they want to bring her ta her pediatrician, who they trust, and who knows her very well. They insist that they will watch their daughter all the time, and feel she will be fine. What course of action Is most appropriate?",
        "options": [
            "A. Discharge the patient home with her parents.",
            "B. Discharge the patient home with her parents after they sign a form indicating they will take all responsibility for monitoring their daughter.",
            "C. Hold the patient in the emergency department overnight for re-evaluation in the morning.",
            "D. Hold the patient in the emergency department until the patient's pediatrician can be reached and an appointment confirmed within the next few days.",
            "E. Admit the patient to the hospital, involuntarily if necessary."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This patient is an acute and significant danger to herself. A suicide attempt brought her to the hospital, and she remains guarded and evasive when answering questions about her actions, mood, and intentions. Although this patient is a minor, the physician's duty to protect her supersedes parental wishes; therefore, she should be hospitalized for treatment. Of course, it would be best to try to convince the parents of the need for hospitalization, but their consent is not necessary before proceeding.\n(Choices A and B) Although this patient seems to have supportive parents, they cannot realistically guarantee her safety, as no one can watch a teenager or adult all the time. Documentation of the parental intent to monitor their daughter does not relieve the physician of his or her duty to protect the girl, who should be admitted to the hospital.\n(Choice C) Waiting twelve hours is unlikely to provide any information that will change the treatment plan for this patient, who is an acute danger to herself. It can be of benefit to hold an intoxicated patient overnight, however, as information is better exchanged once the patient is no longer under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n(Choice D) Because this patient is an acute danger to herself, she should be hospitalized instead of released to the care of an outpatient physician. Once she is deemed stable enough for discharge, however, a follow-up appointment with her pediatrician and/or psychiatrist would be appropriate.\nEducational objective:\nPatients who are acute dangers to themselves should be hospitalized (involuntarily, if necessary) for treatment and stabilization. This principle applies to minors as well, even when parents or guardians disagree."

        "question": "A young mother brings in her 10-year-ald son ta the pediatrician far a follow-up visit. The boy was recently diagnosed with osteosarcoma. The mather looks very happy today and says that she is no langer worried about her son's prognosis. She relates that she had a dream last night in which she saw an angel who smiled upon her. She believes this was an indication that her son is destined to live a long time. Which one of the following defense mechanisms is this woman employing?",
        "options": [
            "A. Denial",
            "B. Fantasy",
            "C. Humor",
            "D. Suppression",
            "E. Isolation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Psychological defense mechanisms are our unconscious means of responding and adapting to different situations while still preserving our self-image. These mechanisms usually serve to decrease anxiety, and can be classified as immature, neurotic, or mature. Immature defense mechanisms are more commonly used by children or adolescents and result in socially unacceptable behavior that prevents the individual from coping with reality. Neurotic defense mechanisms are fairly common in adults and provide short-term relief, but often result in long-term complications. Mature defense mechanisms are most often used by adults and allow for a \"healthy\" and more constructive approach to reality.\nFantasy is an immature defense mechanism that substitutes a less disturbing view of the world in place of reality as a means of resolving conflict. In this case, the mother interprets the appearance of an angel in her dream as meaning her son will live a long time. Fantasy offers escape from anxiety about her son's illness.\n(Choice A) An immature defense mechanism, denial is the refusal to accept a disturbing aspect of external reality because it is too threatening. An example would be a man who is diagnosed with a terminal illness but refuses to admit that he is anything but perfectly healthy.\n(Choice C) Humor is a mature defense mechanism in which the individual uses comic relief to reduce anxiety in otherwise stressful situations. An example would be a recently fired man who jokes about being unable to find another job.\n(Choice D) Suppression is a mature defense mechanism that involves intentionally postponing the exploration of anxiety-provoking thoughts by substituting other thoughts. This allows for the individual to cope with the present reality instead. An example would be a woman who focuses on her children's needs instead of thinking about her father's diagnosis of cancer.\n(Choice E) A mature defense mechanism, isolation is the separating of a thought from its emotional components, thereby making it tolerable. An example would be a bank teller who is calm and collected while foiling a robbery attempt.\nEducational Objective:\nFantasy is an immature defense mechanism that substitutes a less disturbing view of the world in place of reality as a means of resolving conflict."

            "D. Admit the boy to the hospital",
            "E. Perform a complete evaluation of family dynamics"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Child abuse should be suspected when an injury cannot be explained or is inconsistent with the provided history. Physicians should be especially wary if injuries are discovered on the backs of the hands, genitals, back, or buttocks of a child. Of great concern are injuries that are suggestive of a cigarette burn (circular, punched out lesions) or immersion in scalding hot water (clear line of demarcation with no splash marks). When child abuse is suspected, a complete physical examination should be performed first.\n(Choice B) A radiographic skeletal survey is valuable in the diagnosis of child abuse, especially in children younger than two years of age. Multiple fractures in various stages of healing are suggestive of child abuse. Rib fractures, periosteal spiral fractures (in children who cannot yet walk), and chip fractures are other indicators that child abuse may be a concern.\n(Choice C) Physicians are required by law to report any case of suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services. Although this step is mandatory, it is essential to complete the physical examination first.\n(Choice D) Children who have severe injuries, uncertain diagnoses, or who are in need of safe placement should be admitted to the hospital until all necessary intervention can be performed. When child abuse is suspected, clinical and laboratory evaluations can be carried out without parental consent. A complete physical examination will, however, need to be performed as the first step.\n(Choice E) An evaluation of family dynamics is necessary in all child abuse cases, and may require consultation with a psychiatrist. However, this is not the best initial step.\nEducational Objective:\nWhen child abuse is suspected, the following steps should be performed:\n1. Complete physical examination\n2. Radiographic skeletal survey, if needed\n3. Coagulation profile (if multiple bruises are present)\n4. Report to Child Protective Services\n5. Admit to hospital if necessary\n6. Consult psychiatrist and evaluate family dynamics"

Lithium is a first-line medication in the treatment of bipolar disorder. This patient, however, has impaired renal function as evidenced by his elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and since lithium is excreted through the kidneys and has been shown to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus after prolonged use, impaired renal function is a contraindication for lithium therapy. Suitable alternatives to lithium include valproic acid or carbamazepine, both of which are metabolized by the liver.\n(Choice A) A tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline could aggravate manic symptoms in this patient and is therefore inappropriate.\n(Choice B) A SSRI antidepressant such as fluoxetine could aggravate manic symptoms in this patient and is therefore inappropriate.\n(Choice C) Haloperidol is beneficial for the acute management of agitation and aggressiveness, but is not appropriate for long-term treatment of bipolar disorder.\n(Choice D) Lithium is contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function.\nEducational objective:\nLithium should not be administered to patients with renal dysfunction, and both valproic acid and carbamazepine are suitable alternatives for the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder in this patient population."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This question addresses the importance of maintaining professional conduct when dealing with patients of all types, ranging from the antagonistic to the seductive to the familiar. To maintain a therapeutic distance, the physician should politely inform the woman that he sees patients only when they have scheduled appointments during normal office hours. After arranging for an appointment for the next available date, the patient should be examined in the presence of a nurse. If the findings continue to be negative, the patient should be scheduled for a mammogram because she is older than 35 years of age. Should the mammographic findings be negative, she should be informed that a breast mass has been definitively ruled out.\n(Choice B) Asking the patient if she is flirting would create an awkward and potentially very hostile situation. The correct approach, even for seductive patients, is to provide the required medical care for the patient in a professional manner.\n(Choice E) Having a friendly chat with this woman will blur the doctor-patient relationship boundaries. Instead, the physician should conduct himself professionally and discuss the patient's medical concerns within the confines of a scheduled appointment.\nEducational Objective:\nWhen dealing with patients (including antagonistic, seductive, or familiar types), the physician must remain polite and professional while addressing the patient's medical and psychological needs. Avoiding the patient, behaving rudely, or calling attention to any inappropriate behavior is not recommended."

        "explanation": "Antipsychotic medications (e.g. risperidone) cause dopamine blockade, and since dopamine is a prolactin-inhibiting factor, the blockade of dopamine can lead to hyperprolactinemia and symptoms such as gynecomastia galactorrhea, menstrual dysfunction, and decreased libido. In this scenario, risperidone is likely responsible for this patient's symptoms.\n(Choice A) Fibrocystic disease of the breast usually presents with bilateral tenderness and palpable lumps during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Galactorrhea is not a common finding.\n(Choice B) Large cell carcinoma of the lung may produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), resulting in gynecomastia, milky discharge, and elevated levels of serum hCG. However, such a carcinoma rarely develops in a 23-year-old female, and her urine pregnancy test (which measures hCG) was negative.\n(Choice C) Pregnancy is an unlikely cause of this woman's symptoms because there is no history of amenorrhea and her urine pregnancy test was negative.\n(Choice D) Prolactinomas are benign pituitary tumors that typically cause headaches and visual disturbances, and tend to produce very high levels of prolactin (=200 ng/mL).\n(Choice F) Hypothyroidism can cause galactorrhea, but is typically also associated with other complaints such as lethargy, dry skin, or cold intolerance. Moreover, this patient's TSH is in the normal range.\nEducational objective:\nAntipsychotic medications can cause hyperprolactinemia secondary to their dopamine blockade effect. Prolactinomas tend to produce very high levels of prolactin (=200 ng/mL)."

She has visited several physicians for these complaints and underwent extensive workups, all of which were unremarkable. This presentation is consistent with somatization disorder. Patients with this condition benefit from regularly scheduled visits that focus on the psychological distress associated with the symptoms.\n(Choice A) Telling the patient that there is nothing wrong with her will offend her and undermine future doctor-patient communication. If she is not given support and encouragement at this visit, she will likely leave in search of other physicians because she is convinced that her symptoms are evidence of a genuine physical ailment.\n(Choice B) Acting in a paternalistic and dismissive manner will likely alienate this patient. It is important to listen well and be tactful when discussing patient concerns, especially when sensitive psychological issues may be involved.\n(Choice C) Additional medical workup will not be helpful because this patient has already undergone extensive evaluation of her symptoms. Instead, the emphasis should be on scheduling regular appointments with the intention of addressing the psychological distress associated with the symptoms.\n(Choice E) Immediately telling the patient that she has somatization disorder is not recommended as it would likely alienate her at this early stage. This patient is convinced that she's seriously ill, and she considers all of her previous doctors incompetent because they were unable to provide a diagnosis. Therefore, the best approach would be to schedule regular appointments for her. After several visits have strengthened the therapeutic bond, the patient should be made aware that there are psychological factors involved that might warrant a psychiatric consult.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients with somatization disorder benefit from regularly scheduled appointments intended to reduce the underlying psychological distress."

The patient in this case demonstrates delusions, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms. Since he has had these symptoms for three months, the correct diagnosis is schizophreniform disorder.\n(Choice A) The diagnosis of schizophrenia would be made if the symptoms had been present for six months or longer.\n(Choice B) Schizoaffective disorder encompasses the symptoms of schizophrenia and the symptoms of a mood disorder (eg, major depressive disorder, manic episode, or mixed episode) at some point in the illness.\n(Choice D) Brief psychotic episode requires one or more of the following symptoms to be present: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized behavior.

        "explanation": "Bereavement is a normal reaction to the death of a loved one. Some grieving individuals will present with the classic symptoms of major depression, but the symptoms are less pronounced. Normal bereavement rarely lasts longer than two months from the time of loss and does not cause as much functional impairment as does a major depressive episode.\n(Choice A) Although this patient does have some of the symptoms of major depression (including depressed mood, insomnia, weight loss, and fatigue), the recent loss of a loved one makes bereavement a much more likely diagnosis. Moreover, her sorrow has not caused such an impairment of functionality that she cannot work.\n(Choice B) Cyclothymia is a chronic mood disturbance involving repeated hypomanic and mild depressive episodes that do not meet the criteria for mania or major depression, respectively. This condition lasts for at least two years and does not significantly impair social or occupational functionality.\n(Choice C) Dysthymic disorder is characterized by a chronically depressed mood that is present most of the time for a period of at least two years. The symptoms of dysthymia are milder than those of major depression.\n(Choice E) Adjustment disorder is characterized by behavioral symptoms in response to a stressor that has occurred within the previous three months. The distress evident with adjustment disorder is in excess of what is expected, and usually causes significant impairment in social or occupational functioning.\nEducational Objective:\nBereavement is the normal reaction to the loss of a loved one. Symptoms are similar to those seen with major depression but are less intense and usually significantly taper within two months."

        "explanation": "Although this patient has been on lithium for the past six months, he is now experiencing a manic episode. It is important to first obtain a urine toxicology screen to ensure he has not recently taken cocaine or amphetamine, as usage of either stimulant can result in a manic presentation. In the presence of a negative toxicology screen, lithium levels should be evaluated to determine if noncompliance or insufficient drug levels could be responsible for this man's manic episode.\n(Choice A) It may prove necessary to increase the dose of lithium, but it is important to evaluate the lithium levels first.\n(Choice B) Haloperidol would be an appropriate choice if this patient were violent or extremely agitated. In the absence of such a presentation, haloperidol should not be given.\n(Choice D) If lithium proves to be ineffective in controlling this man's bipolar disorder, it would be appropriate to discontinue the lithium and initiate treatment with valproate.\n(Choice E) As an SSRI antidepressant, fluoxetine is not indicated in the treatment of mania.\nEducational Objective:\nIf a patient presents with refractory mania despite therapy with a mood stabilizer, a urine toxicology screen and mood stabilizer drug levels should be obtained in the initial evaluation."

        "explanation": "Dysthymic disorder can be thought of as a chronic, low-grade depression that lasts years. Although affected individuals don't meet all the criteria for a major depressive episode, they share many of the same symptoms. This patient, who has felt this way all her life, has a classic presentation. Dysthymic patients can sometimes develop a major depressive episode super-imposed on their dysthymia (called double depression). Treatment for dysthymia is with antidepressants.\n(Choice A) Patients with avoidant personality disorder have a lifelong pattern of feeling inadequate, avoiding activities out of fear of being judged, and being afraid to have intimate relationships. This patient's lack of relationships is better explained by her chronic depressive symptoms, rather than a fear of being judged by others.\n(Choice C) This patient has some symptoms of major depressive disorder, but does not meet full criteria. Major depressive disorder also tends to be more episodic, rather than chronic. Based on the patient’s low level long-term symptoms, dysthymic disorder is a better diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a lifelong pattern of detachment from social relationships and restricted range of emotions. These patients lead solitary lives, have no interest in socialization, and have few supports beyond family. This patient's social isolation is better explained by her chronic depressive symptoms rather than lack of desire for relationships.\n(Choice E) The patient's chronic depressive symptoms are having a negative impact on her level of functioning.

The most common withdrawal symptoms experienced include muscle spasms, joint pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and sweating. On examination, the pupils are dilated and the patient is irritable. Autonomic instability in the form of hypertension is often evident.\n(Choice A) Abrupt cessation of cocaine use can cause a rebound suppression of cocaine's stimulant effect. This causes patients to feel irritable, drowsy, fatigued, and hungry (as opposed to anorexic while intoxicated). Psychomotor agitation or retardation may be present.\n(Choice C) Patients suffering from alcohol withdrawal develop signs and symptoms between 12 and 48 hours after the last drink. During the acute stage they develop sweating, hyperreflexia, tremors, and seizures. This is followed by acute hallucinosis (auditory/visual) in the absence of autonomic symptoms. The final stage is that of delirium tremens, which usually occurs 2-4 days after the last drink. Patients suffering from delirium tremens present with altered sensorium, hallucinations, and autonomic instability (tachycardia, fever, sweating). Death can result if the condition is not properly treated.\n(Choice D) Amphetamine, like cocaine, is a stimulant and therefore presents with similar withdrawal symptoms (irritability, fatigue, increased appetite, psychomotor disturbance). Depression is also common.\n(Choice E) Nicotine withdrawal can produce symptoms of irritability, anxiety, depression, insomnia, restlessness, poor concentration, increased appetite, weight gain, and bradycardia.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect heroin withdrawal in patients with pupillary dilatation, rhinorrhea, muscle and joint aches, abdominal cramping, nausea, and diarrhea.

She mentions depressed mood, helplessness, poor sleep, anhedonia, and active suicidality. Given this presentation, treatment with an antidepressant is indicated. If the medication is effective, it will allow her to better enjoy the time she has left.\nIn general, patients with chronic conditions that are debilitating or painful are at higher risk of committing suicide than are patients with terminal illnesses.\n(Choice A) It is a physician's responsibility to listen carefully to patients and to provide reassurance when appropriate, but in this case reassurance alone is insufficient. The next best step is to prescribe an antidepressant.\n(Choice B) All individuals stricken with a terminal illness should be advised of the need to prepare advance directives. However, this woman's depression should be addressed first because she is actively considering committing suicide.\n(Choice D) Although it is normal for patients with fatal illnesses to feel helpless and sad, this woman's suicidality is of great concern and requires immediate attention.\n(Choice E) It is indeed appropriate to recommend that this woman communicate her thoughts and feelings openly with her family members.

That said, the patient should be strongly encouraged to discuss his diagnosis with his spouse, as she will be significantly impacted by it. Moreover, she will likely provide tremendous moral support to her husband, thereby easing his burden.\n(Choice A) It would be unethical to breach patient confidentiality by revealing information about the patient's health to his wife without his permission.\n(Choice B) Telling the patient that the wife will be informed of his diagnosis if he fails to do so first is inappropriate because his wife is in no imminent danger of contracting his illness. However, every effort should be made to encourage an open dialogue between the patient and his wife.\n(Choice C) Telling the wife that the pathology report is not complete is dishonest and is therefore not a good choice. Although it is important to protect patient confidentiality, under no circumstances is it appropriate to lie to family members or other third parties.\n(Choice D) Telling the wife to figure it out on her own is a rude, terse response and would therefore be inappropriate.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients have a right to confidentiality unless their condition poses an imminent danger to other individuals or society. However, patients should be strongly encouraged to discuss their health and medical conditions with loved ones."

        "question": "A 49-year-old man who appears anxious presents complaining of sleep difficulties. He says that his job as a marketing executive is very stressful and involves considerable travel. In the past six manths, he has made many trips back and forth between Japan and the United States. He is frustrated because he experiences excessive drowsiness during the daytime and finds it difficult to fall asleep at night. He often wakes early in the morning and then finds himself unable to fall back asleep. As a result, he is exhausted and \"drained of all energy\" during the workday. In addition, he notes, he feels very irritable and \"low\" these days, especially because his sleep troubles have impacted his concentration and effectiveness at work. What is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",
        "options": [
            "A. Primary insomnia",
            "B. Adjustment disorder",
            "C. Circadian rhythm sleep disorder",
            "D. Generalized anxiety disorder",
            "E. Major depression",
            "F. Seasonal affective disorder",
            "G. Age-related sleep changes",
            "H. Restless legs syndrome"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This patient is experiencing sleep difficulties and subsequent functional impairment because of his frequent travel between different time zones. Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, jet-lag subtype would therefore be the most appropriate diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Primary insomnia is characterized by a lifelong difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in functional impairment during the daytime. This would be a possible diagnosis in the absence of a history of frequent travel between different time zones.\n(Choice B) Adjustment disorder is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor. Marked distress is present, in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor. This distress leads to significant functional and social impairment. This patient's presentation is not consistent with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder.\n(Choice D) Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by anxiety and worry about a variety of events or activities. Symptoms last for a minimum of six months. Associated features include sleep disturbances, irritability, poor concentration, excessive fatigue, muscle tension, and restlessness. Since this patient's anxiety is related to one specific issue (his poor sleep), generalized anxiety disorder would not be an accurate diagnosis.\n(Choice E) The patient in this scenario does complain of \"low mood,\" poor sleep, early morning awakening, and occupational impairment, which are some of the features of major depression. However, he does not complain of other key depressive symptoms (eg, anhedonia, guilt, loss of appetite, suicidality). Moreover, his symptoms are present in the context of frequent travel, which suggests that circadian rhythm sleep disorder is a more likely diagnosis.\n(Choice F) Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a recurring depression that has an onset and remission associated with particular seasons. The two subtypes of SAD are summer-onset and fall-onset, with the latter being more common. As the patient in this scenario does not meet the criteria for depression and his symptoms are not season-specific, SAD would be an unlikely diagnosis.\n(Choice G) Older adults experience lighter sleep that is more often interrupted. More time is spent in Stage 1, the transitional stage, and less time is spent in Stages 3 and 4, the periods of deep, restorative sleep. Because this patient is only middle-aged and he complains of symptoms that are far more dramatic than those expected with normal aging, a diagnosis of age-related sleep changes would not be supported.\n(Choice H) Restless legs syndrome is a disorder characterized by an intense and unpleasant creeping sensation in the lower extremities that is relieved by moving the legs. The symptoms most often occur with the onset of sleep.\nEducational Objective:\nCircadian rhythm sleep disorder is a likely diagnosis in a patient with insomnia who often travels between different time zones."

        "question": "One of the nurses wha works at your group medical practice asks you ta examine her mother, a 61-year-old woman who has been complaining of headaches. When the waman presents for her first appointment, she admits to having had a severe, persistent headache far the past two months. She says the headache is worse in the mornings, but that it always lingers throughout the day. The pain has been significant enough that she decided to accept an early retirement offer from her employer. She denies any vomiting but usually feels nauseated. Her medical history is significant for depression and anxiety. A complete warkup reveals the presence of a CNS lymphoma. Your nurse discovers paperwork confirming the diagnosis befare you have had a chance to meet with her mather again. The daughter pleads with you to not reveal the diagnosis to her maother, as she feels certain it would be devastating. Which of the following is the most appropriate response?",
        "options": [
            "A. \"As a physician, | have the moral responsibility to reveal the diagnosis to her.\"",
            "B. \"Is there a specific reason why you do not want your mother to know the diagnosis?\"",

            "E. \"Your mother has a right to know her diagnosis.\""
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In general, a patient enjoys the right to know her diagnosis. If family members plead with you to withhold information from the patient, it is imperative to discover what their reasoning is. Occasionally, it is in the best interest of the patient to withhold especially gloomy news (eg, if a severely depressed patient might become suicidal). Therefore, it is best to clarify the situation with the concerned family members first before deciding how best to proceed.\n(Choices A and E) Telling the nurse that you are morally obligated to inform the patient of her diagnosis is indeed accurate (albeit with some qualifications). However, it would be better to first establish what the daughter's reasoning is for withholding the diagnosis before deciding how to handle the situation.\n(Choice C) Immediately agreeing to withhold news of the diagnosis is inappropriate because the daughter's reasoning should first be explored and discussed.\n(Choice D) Answering the daughter's request with a rude, abrupt response is unprofessional. It is important to provide support to both the daughter and her mother.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients have the right to know their diagnoses. If a family member requests that the diagnosis not be revealed to the patient, the underlying reasons should be explored before deciding how to proceed."

On further inquiry, he admits to having lost interest in his hobbies, having difficulty concentrating, and feeling hopeless at times. He denies any suicidality. Physical examination and laboratory studies are within normal limits. The patient is diagnosed with major depressive disarder and sertraline is started. On a follow-up visit two months later, he states that his depressive symptoms are anly minimally improved and that he now also experiences difficulty in maintaining an erection. The decision is made to change his medication. Which of the following medications would be mast appropriate far this patient?",
        "options": [
            "A. Amitriptyline",

            "H. Venlafaxine"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Antidepressants can largely be classified as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants), and MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Sertraline is an SSRI that works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin at the presynaptic nerve terminal, thereby increasing the concentration of available serotonin in the brain. Common side effects of SSRIs include nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, headache, insomnia or sedation, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction (e.g. decreased libido, delayed/retrograde ejaculation, or erectile dysfunction).\nBupropion is an antidepressant that inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake. Unlike the SSRIs and many other antidepressants, bupropion is not associated with sexual dysfunction and is therefore recommended in this patient who is unable to maintain an erection.\n(Choice A) Amitriptyline is a TCA that has the potential to cause sexual side effects. Therefore, it is not a good choice for this patient.\n(Choice C) Although buspirone is not known to cause sexual side effects, it is used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, not depression.\n(Choice D) Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is mostly used in the treatment of refractory psychosis.\n(Choice E) Citalopram is an SSRI and therefore also has the potential to cause sexual side effects. Therefore, it is not the best choice in this patient.\n(Choice F) Phenelzine is an MAOI. MAOIs are a class of medications that are rarely used currently for the treatment of depression, mostly because of the dietary restrictions associated with them.\n(Choice G) Trazodone is rarely used now in the treatment of depression because of poor efficacy. However, it is sometimes used for the treatment of insomnia because of its sedative properties. Another potential side effect of trazodone is priapism.\n(Choice H) Venlafaxine is an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake that has the potential to cause sexual side effects. Therefore, it is not the best choice for this patient.\nEducational objective:\nThe antidepressant of choice in depressed patients suffering from sexual dysfunction (whether as a medication side effect or as a pre-existing condition) is bupropion."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This patient has developed acute onset mental status changes and memory impairment. When signs such as these arise in a patient, it is important to be prepared to differentiate delirium from dementia. Delirium is acute in onset and causes global memory impairment, along with fluctuations in consciousness described as \"waxing and waning.\" Symptoms may worsen at night, a phenomenon known as \"sundowning.\" Delirium is reversible and commonly occurs in the setting of one or more medical conditions (infection in this patient).\n(Choice A) In contrast with delirium, Alzheimer's dementia causes an irreversible and progressive cognitive decline. Symptoms are gradual in onset, and remote memory is spared initially. There is no impairment of consciousness.\n(Choice B) Vascular dementia (also called multi-infarct dementia) is a diagnosis to consider in this patient given his age and the finding of a carotid bruit. However, the absence of any focal neurological signs and the clinical setting indicate that delirium is a more likely diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by sudden onset psychosis that lasts for a few hours to a month with an eventual return to premorbid levels of functioning. Although this patient is agitated, he does not have psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions). In addition, the occurrence of his symptoms in the setting of a general medical condition increases the likelihood that delirium is present.\n(Choice E) Parkinsonism can present with memory impairment, but the absence of cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and masked facies make the diagnosis unlikely. Moreover, the dementia associated with Parkinsonism is more gradual in onset.\nEducational Objective:\nDifferentiation of Delirium and Dementia\n1. Onset: Acute in delirium vs. gradual in dementia\n2. Consciousness: Impaired in delirium vs. intact in dementia\n3. Course: Fluctuating symptoms in delirium vs. progressive decline in dementia\n4. Prognosis: Reversible symptoms in delirium vs. irreversible symptoms in dementia\n5. Memory impairment: Global in delirium vs. remote memory spared in dementia"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal can develop minor symptoms (eg, tremulousness, anxiety, sweating, palpitations) within 6 hours of the last drink. This stage is followed by alcoholic hallucinosis, which involves visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations independent of autonomic symptoms that typically resolve within 24-48 hours. Vitals signs are usually normal and sensorium is intact. The last stage is that of delirium tremens, which is associated with hallucinations, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, low-grade fever, sweating, and agitation. Since this patient developed agitation and auditory hallucinations on the second day of admission, it is logical to conclude that his symptoms are secondary to alcoholic hallucinosis.\n(Choice B) Paranoid schizophrenia is associated with hallucinations and delusions, as well as eccentric behavior and cognitive difficulties. Symptoms should be present for at least six months and do not resolve spontaneously.\n(Choice C) Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a long-term pattern of distrust and suspiciousness. Patients with this condition tend to negatively interpret the actions, words and intentions of others. They frequently suspect that people seek to harm them or deceive them, but can rarely cite supporting evidence. Personality traits do not resolve spontaneously or in a matter of days.\n(Choice D) Patients with acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication present with behavioral changes such as impulsiveness, marked agitation, impaired judgment, psychosis, paranoia, hallucinations, or assaultiveness. Had this patient used phencyclidine just prior to presentation, he would not have begun hallucinating days later.\n(Choice E) A diagnosis of brief psychotic episode requires the presence of hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized behavior for at least one day but less than one month, with the eventual complete resolution of symptoms. This diagnosis should not be made if drug or alcohol abuse is likely responsible for bizarre behavior.\n(Choice F) Adjustment disorder is the development of marked emotional distress in response to an identifiable stressor that occurred within the past three months. Hallucinations are not typically seen with this condition.\n(Choice G) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with recurrent intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and flashbacks about a traumatic event. Known triggers of PTSD include military combat, natural disasters, serious motor vehicle accidents, violent assault, sexual abuse, and kidnapping. Symptoms last for a minimum of one month and may persist for many years.\nEducational objective:\nAlcoholic hallucinations typically develop within 12 to 24 hours of last drink and resolve within 24 to 48 hours. Unlike delirium tremens, sensorium is intact and vital signs are usually normal."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike the atypical antipsychotics, the typical antipsychotics are associated with a high frequency of extrapyramidal side effects. In this case, the patient has developed acute dystonia in response to receiving haloperidol. Acute dystonia can develop abruptly at any point between four hours and four days after receiving an antipsychotic medication. It is characterized by muscle spasms or stiffness, tongue protrusions or twisting, opisthotonus, and oculogyric crisis (a forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in an upward position). Treatment of acute dystonia is primarily with antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) or anticholinergics (e.g. benztropine or trihexyphenidyl).\n(Choice B) Beta-blockers such as propranolol can be used to treat akathisia, which is a condition that can occur at any time during the course of antipsychotic use. These patients report a subjective feeling of restlessness and may pace constantly, unable to sit still.\n(Choice C) Dantrolene is used to treat neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening condition that can arise at any point during treatment with an antipsychotic. NMS is characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis.\n(Choice D) Levodopa is a treatment for Parkinson's disease. When parkinsonism develops as a side effect from antipsychotic use (usually within four days to four months of treatment), the drug of choice is an anticholinergic agent such as benztropine. Parkinsonism is characterized by cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, shuffling gait, and resting tremor.\n(Choice E) Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that tends to cause less extrapyramidal side effects than other antipsychotic medications. However, it is not used for the treatment of acute dystonia.\nEducational objective:\nPatients who develop acute dystonia from the use of antipsychotics should be treated with benztropine or diphenhydramine."

For the past four months, she has felt as if her co-workers have been spying on her and talking about her behind her back. She denies any hallucinations, depression, or anxiety. She states that these feelings are adversely impacting her performance at work. She has no significant past medical history. Her father has caranary artery disease and hypertension, and her mother has a history of depression.

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication often used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or agitation. Although all atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects, they are all associated with an increased risk of weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Clozapine and olanzapine appear to pose the greatest risk of weight gain. Due to these potential side effects, the American Psychiatric Association recommends baseline assessment of weight, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and fasting lipid profile before starting atypical antipsychotics. In addition, these parameters should be reassessed after 12 weeks of treatment in all patients taking these medications.\n(Choice A) Baseline kidney function should be evaluated in patients taking lithium, not olanzapine.\n(Choice B) Although there have been rare reports of olanzapine causing agranulocytosis, complete blood counts (CBC) are not routinely checked. Patients taking clozapine, however, require weekly blood counts for the first six months of treatment.\n(Choice C) An electrocardiogram (ECG) does not need to be obtained when starting a patient on olanzapine. However, it may be appropriate to obtain an ECG in patients taking the atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone due to its potential for causing QT prolongation.\n(Choice E) Olanzapine can lead to an increase in liver transaminase levels, but routine monitoring of liver function tests is not necessary.\n(Choice F) Hyperprolactinemia can occur when using typical antipsychotics as well as the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. Olanzapine, however, is not well known to increase prolactin levels.\n(Choice G) Lithium, not olanzapine, may cause hypothyroidism, and requires routine monitoring of thyroid function.\nEducational objective:\nAll atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, can cause weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Routine monitoring for the development of these side effects is recommended in patients taking these medications."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The need for advance directives or a living will should be explained early on to all patients with chronic or terminal illnesses. The presence of such documents will ensure that patients receive the desired quality and level of care when they are otherwise unable to make such decisions. When family members disagree with the authority of a patient's living will, the medical team should meet with them to clarify all of the issues before deciding upon the next step. The family should be asked if they have better suggestions for the patient's care. It is also necessary to precisely explain the meaning of the patient's wishes as stated in the living will, as well as to determine whether the family disagrees with the physician's interpretation. A tactful, open discussion is usually greatly helpful in addressing any underlying fears or reservations the family might have.\n(Choices A and B) Proceeding with CPR or intubating the patient would be in clear violation of the patient's wishes. Because the living will is an official, legally binding document, failing to honor its terms invites a lawsuit.\n(Choice D) Initiating an immediate discussion with the family in this situation would be the best next step. If the family continued to disagree with the contents of the living will and insisted that CPR be performed, it would be appropriate to contact the hospital's ethics committee for input.\n(Choice E) It would be highly inappropriate to pursue a court order authorizing medical intervention when the patient has already expressed his wishes regarding end of life care.\nEducational Objective:\nIf a patient's family disagrees with his living will and demands care that contradicts the patient's written wishes, the best initial step is to discuss the matter with the family. If a discussion fails to resolve the situation, then the hospital's ethics committee should be consulted."

        "explanation": "This patient is suffering from a specific phobia of public speaking. Beta-blockers such as propranolol are excellent medications for prophylaxis against anxiety for this patient population when public speaking is unavoidable. They can be used on an as needed basis to help control much of the trembling, tachycardia, and other sympathetic symptoms associated with anxiety. Specific phobias can also benefit from behavioral therapy such as flooding, biofeedback, relaxation therapy, and exposure desensitization.\n(Choice A) Buspirone is used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, but not specific phobias.\n(Choice B) Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that is often used in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. However, it has no role in the treatment of performance-related anxiety.\n(Choice C) Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used in the treatment of anxiety. However it is long-acting and therefore not well suited for short activities such as public speaking. Benzodiazepines can also cause sedation and even confusion, which further explains why they are poor choices in situations where one is expected to perform.\n(Choice E) Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used in the treatment of depression and a variety of anxiety disorders. Since this patient's anxiety is only situational, it would be inappropriate to prescribe a daily medication.\nEducational objective:\nPropranolol is the drug of choice for treating performance-related anxiety."

        "explanation": "Major depression is diagnosed when at least five of the following symptoms (including either depressed mood or anhedonia) are present nearly every day for at least two consecutive weeks: Depressed mood; Sleep disorder; loss of Interest (anhedonia); Guilt (worthlessness, hopelessness, regret); loss of Energy; poor Concentration; decreased Appetite; Psychomotor retardation or agitation; or Suicidality. These symptoms can be remembered by using the mnemonic \"SIGECAPS.\" This patient meets the criteria for major depression, and will need to be treated. However, before deciding on a treatment plan it is critical to assess whether she is actively considering suicide. If so, she should then be asked if she has a specific suicide plan. The existence of such a plan would indicate that she is at very high risk of committing suicide and may need hospitalization to maintain her safety.\n(Choice A) Arranging to meet with the patient's husband would not address the immediate issue of her depression. However, it might be helpful to recommend that she and her husband seek marital therapy.\n(Choice C) Ruling out hypothyroidism is common practice in patients with a new episode of depression. However, asking this patient about suicidality is a more immediate concern.\n(Choice D) Psychotherapy is useful in the treatment of mild to moderate depression with or without medications, but this patient's suicidality needs to be assessed first.\n(Choice E) Sertraline is a SSRI that is used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Within the first few weeks of initiating pharmacotherapy, depressed patients must be very closely monitored for suicidality because they are even more likely to act on their impulses, as motivation and initiative tend to improve before a depressed outlook. This further emphasizes the importance of assessing this patient's suicidality before beginning treatment.\n(Choice F) Mild to moderate depression without active suicidal ideation can usually be managed on an outpatient basis. Patients with severe depression and suicidal thoughts or behavior often require hospitalization to maintain their safety. Therefore, this patient's suicidality needs to be assessed before a treatment decision can be made.\nEducational objective:\nAll depressed patients should be screened for suicidal ideation. Actively suicidal patients will often need to be hospitalized for stabilization and to maintain their safety."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A history of seizures is an absolute contraindication to the use of bupropion. The woman in this scenario is clearly depressed and would likely benefit from an antidepressant. In light of her history of epilepsy, she should be started on another antidepressant, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).\n(Choices A, C, E, F, G, H, and I) These medical problems are not contraindications to the use of bupropion.\n(Choice B) Although heart failure can result from an overdose with bupropion, the presence of ischemic heart disease is not an absolute contraindication to the medication's use. A dose alteration would be advisable, however.\nEducational Objective:\nA history of seizure disorder is an absolute contraindication to the use of bupropion."

Upan arriving for the appointment, he expresses concern over his strained relations with his wife. He relates a recent incident in which he and his wife had an intense argument about where they should spend their next vacation. After the argument, he left the house and wrecked the car she had given to him as a birthday present last year. Which of the following defense mechanisms did this man employ?",

            "E. Dissociation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Psychological defense mechanisms are our unconscious means of responding and adapting to different situations while still preserving our self-image. These mechanisms usually serve to decrease anxiety, and can be classified as immature, neurotic, or mature. Immature defense mechanisms are more commonly used by children or adolescents and result in socially unacceptable behavior that prevents the individual from coping with reality. Neurotic defense mechanisms are fairly common in adults and provide short-term relief, but often result in long-term complications. Mature defense mechanisms are most often used by adults and allow for a \"healthy\" and more constructive approach to reality.\nA neurotic defense mechanism, displacement is the shifting of emotions associated with an upsetting object or person to a safer alternate object or person that represents the original in some regard. In this scenario, the patient is so frustrated by the argument with his wife that he damages the car she gave him. In this way, he displaces his anger from his wife to the car because it is a more acceptable target.\n(Choice A) An immature defense mechanism, regression is the return to more immature levels of functioning when confronted by a stressful situation. An example would be a child who was previously toilet-trained but began to wet his bed after the birth of a new sibling.\n(Choice B) An immature defense mechanism, distortion is the altered perception of disturbing aspects of external reality in an effort to make it more acceptable. An example would be an intravenous drug abuser who contracts hepatitis C and blames his condition on inadequate control of hepatitis C within the community.\n(Choice D) An immature defense mechanism, projection is the attributing of unacceptable internal thoughts or emotions to other individuals. An example would be an unfaithful husband who accuses his wife of infidelity.\n(Choice E) A neurotic defense mechanism, dissociation involves blocking off disturbing thoughts or feelings from consciousness in an attempt to avoid emotional upset. An example would be a patient who was rescued from a burning building and now denies any memory of the event.\nEducational Objective:\nDisplacement is a psychological defense mechanism in which unacceptable feelings about one object or person are displaced onto another, \"safer\" object or person."

They may be preoccupied with thoughts of unlimited power and success. A lack of empathy and willingness to exploit others is commonly seen.\n(Choice A) Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by distrust and fear. Individuals with this disorder frequently have unfounded suspicions and misinterpret the motives of others. They may find it difficult to confide in or forgive people.\n(Choice B) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness or precision. Typically stubborn and inflexible, these patients may have obsessive thoughts that cause anxiety until a specific action is taken (eg, the arranging of figurines on a shelf in a certain pattern).\n(Choice C) Delusional disorder requires the presence of non-bizarre delusions (involving situations that are logical possibilities) for at least one month.\n(Choice D) Antisocial personality disorder is an adult condition characterized by disregard for and violation of the rights of others. Individuals with this disorder frequently engage in illegal activities and have a history of conduct disorder during adolescence.\n(Choice F) Acute stress disorder causes symptoms identical to those observed with post-traumatic stress disorder (eg, flashbacks and nightmares about a traumatic event, hypervigilance, social detachment, poor sleep).

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sleep patterns tend to change in older individuals. As people age, they typically sleep less at night and nap during the day. The period of deep sleep (Stage 4 sleep) becomes shorter and eventually disappears. Older people also awaken more during all stages of sleep. These changes are normal and usually do not indicate a sleep disorder.\n(Choice A) Major depression is often associated with difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, or early morning awakening. Excessive sleeping can occur in a minority of depressed patients. Since this patient does not meet the other criteria for major depression, it would not be the appropriate diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Bereavement usually does not last longer than two months, and this patient's wife passed away two years ago. In addition, he leads an active social life and has given no indication that he is continuing to grieve deeply about his wife's death.\n(Choice D) Sleep patterns are often abnormal in people with Alzheimer's dementia. As the dementia progresses, patients often complain of frequent waking from sleep. Although the patient does admit to mild memory impairment, his high-functioning state suggests that the memory loss is simply a result of the normal aging process.\n(Choice E) Obstructive sleep apnea is easily ruled out in this patient as his body habitus is normal and he denies any history of snoring or excessive daytime sleepiness.\nEducational objective:\nOlder individuals may frequently awaken from sleep and spend less time sleeping overall. These changes are considered a normal part of aging."

He was devastated by this news and immediately ended the relationship. He has completely isolated himself from friends and family and now prefers to stay home alone. He admits to having na interest in dating women, even when they seem to be a good match for him. He struggles to concentrate on his work as a mortgage broker and is unable to sleep at night.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Adjustment disorder is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that develop within three months of exposure to an identifiable stressor and that rarely last more than six months after the stressor has ended. The patient experiences marked distress in excess of what would be expected from exposure to the stressor. In this scenario, the man's reaction to the news about his girlfriend's previous relationship is far greater than would be expected. Therefore, the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is appropriate. The treatment of choice for adjustment disorder is psychodynamic psychotherapy or brief cognitive psychotherapy. These two methods focus on developing coping mechanisms and on improving the individual's response to and attitude about stressful situations.\n(Choice A) Since patients suffering from adjustment disorder tend to have depressive symptoms, an SSRI antidepressant such as fluoxetine can be used as adjunctive therapy. The primary form of treatment remains psychotherapy (cognitive or psychodynamic).\n(Choices C and E) Buspirone and clonazepam are anxiolytics that can be used as adjunctive treatments for this patient population when anxiety symptoms are prominent. The primary form of treatment for adjustment disorder remains psychotherapy (cognitive or psychodynamic).\n(Choice D) Trazodone is a helpful adjunctive treatment for those patients suffering from depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. The primary form of treatment for adjustment disorder remains psychotherapy (cognitive or psychodynamic).\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment of choice for adjustment disorder is cognitive or psychodynamic psychotherapy."

She is at thirty weeks of gestation and has missed mast of her prenatal care appointments. Fetal heart manitaring indicates the fetus is in distress and an ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of placental abruption. The patient is informed of the need far an urgent cesarean section. She refuses to undergo a cesarean section, however, and instead insists on vaginal labar. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
        "options": [
            "A. Proceed with cesarean section because there is evidence of fetal distress",
            "B. Proceed with cesarean section because the mother is endangering a viable fetus with her request",

            "E. Allow her to proceed with vaginal labar"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Although this patient's wishes are not in the best interest of her unborn child, she is entitled to make decisions that affect the fetus while it remains attached to her because it is still considered part of her body. Therefore, she cannot be forced into accepting treatment even if it means her unborn child may not survive as a result. She should be advised about the risks and likely consequences of insisting upon vaginal labor.\n(Choices A and B) Because this patient's fetus is still physically a part of her, she cannot be forced to undergo treatment for the benefit of the unborn child. Therefore, it would be unlawful to proceed with the cesarean section against her wishes.\n(Choice C) Telling the patient that she is unreasonable is inappropriate because she has the right to refuse treatment. Instead, she should be informed about the risks and likely consequences of her decision.\n(Choice D) Transferring the patient's care is unethical in part because the patient would not have sufficient time to locate a new obstetrician. Moreover, a new obstetrician would be less familiar with this patient's history and ill-prepared to provide optimal care on such short notice. Instead, the current physician should make every attempt to provide the appropriate treatment for the patient and her unborn child.\nEducational Objective:\nA pregnant woman has the right to refuse treatment, even if it places her unborn child at risk."

The most common symptoms of sexual dysfunction reported by patients using SSRIs are impotence, delayed ejaculation, and decreased libido.\n(Choice A) Elevated blood pressure is associated with the class of antidepressants known as the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine.\n(Choice C) Orthostatic hypotension is more common in the class of antidepressants known as tricyclics, which include amitriptyline.\n(Choice D) Priapism is a potential side effect of the antidepressant trazodone.\n(Choice E) Seizure is a potential side effect of the antidepressant bupropion, especially at higher doses.\nEducational objective:\nAlthough they are considered first line treatments for depression, SSRIs are not without side effects.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an emergent situation, a physician is authorized to provide life-saving treatment to the unconscious patient. This remains true even If the patient's spouse requests that the life-saving treatment (such as a blood transfusion) not be given because it contradicts a belief system. If the patient is conscious or has outlined his wishes in a living will, however, he has the authority to refuse any such care.\n(Choice B) The religious beliefs of patients should be honored whenever possible. However, in the event of a life-threatening situation, the physician should act in the patient's best interests unless he is specifically told not to by the patient himself. Although the wife in this situation claims that her husband is a Jehovah's Witness, the physician is unable to clarify the patient's wishes because the patient is unconscious and has no living will.\n(Choice C) Although the physician does have the final authority in making decisions about patient care, it would be rude and arrogant to inform the patient's wife that her input is not welcome.\n(Choice D) Using alternate supportive measures (eg, intravenous fluids, pressors) would be the correct approach in a patient who has indicated he wants to avoid using blood products. Such measures are often insufficient, however, when a patient has suffered a significant blood loss. Since the alternate supportive measures are already being undertaken in this scenario and the patient remains hemodynamically unstable, a blood transfusion must be ordered as well.\n(Choice E) Court approval is not needed for a physician to proceed with emergent life-saving treatment for an unconscious patient.\nEducational Objective:\nA physician is authorized to provide emergent life-saving treatment to the unconscious patient. This remains true even if the patient's spouse requests that the treatment not be given because it contradicts a belief system."

        "explanation": "The patient has multiple symptoms characteristic of a major depressive episode. In particular, he appears to have melancholic depression, a subtype of major depression characterized by anhedonia, absent mood reactivity, depressed mood (typically worse in the morning), insomnia or early morning awakening, loss of appetite, excessive guilt, and psychomotor agitation or retardation. This man also meets the time criteria for depression, which requires the severely depressed mood to be present for at least two weeks.\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorders are characterized by increased anxiety, depression, or disturbed behavior. These aberrations must develop within three months of an identifiable stressor while lasting no longer than six months after the stressor ends. However, there is no identifiable stressor in this case, and the patient meets criteria for a major depressive episode.\n(Choice B) Dysthymic disorder is a chronic, low-grade depression that persists for years. Although patients with dysthymic disorder do not meet all of the criteria for a major depressive episode, they share many of the same symptoms. This patient meets the criteria for major depression, however, and has been symptomatic for only one month (rather than years).\n(Choice D) Primary insomnia is characterized by the isolated symptom of having difficulty in falling or staying asleep. Given the patient's other associated symptoms, major depressive episode is the more appropriate diagnosis.\n(Choice E) This patient meets criteria for a major depressive episode, as his symptoms have persisted for longer than two weeks and have caused significant impairment in his social and occupational functioning. Because his symptoms surpass what is considered \"normal human experience,\" they warrant treatment.\nEducational objective:\nFor the diagnosis of major depressive disorder, patients should have at least five of eight depressive symptoms for at least two weeks, with the symptoms causing significant functional impairment."

        "explanation": "An atypical antipsychotic, clozapine is the least likely to cause the movement disorders commonly associated with the use of other antipsychotic medications. It is therefore an appropriate choice in a patient with a history of extrapyramidal symptoms. Because clozapine can cause agranulocytosis, however, white blood cell counts must be monitored regularly in all patients taking the medication. It is also important to note that clozapine lowers the seizure threshold.\n(Choice A) Clozapine does not cause jaundice as a side effect. Chlorpromazine is associated with an increased risk of developing jaundice, although this is not due to hemolysis.\n(Choice B) Hepatotoxicity is not associated with clozapine use.\n(Choice C) Pigmentary retinopathy is an adverse effect associated with thioridazine, not clozapine.\n(Choice E) Cataracts are associated with the use of quetiapine, not clozapine.\nEducational Objective:\nAgranulocytosis is a serious side effect associated with clozapine usage.

If multiple episodes of depression have occurred, maintenance therapy will likely need to be continued for a longer period.\n(Choice A) Abrupt cessation of antidepressant therapy before six months have passed would put the patient at high risk for relapsing.\n(Choice B) Because this patient has only experienced one episode of major depression, indefinite therapy with an antidepressant is not indicated.\n(Choice D) This patient's symptoms have responded well to sertraline, which is encouraging. Because nausea is a side effect of most antidepressants (including bupropion), a dose reduction in sertraline is not warranted unless the nausea is very severe or incapacitating.\n(Choice E) There is no need to taper the patient off of his sertraline this early. He should be maintained on the same dose for another six months.\nEducational Objective:\nWhen treating a single episode of major depression, the antidepressant should be continued for a period of six months following the patient's response. If multiple episodes of depression have occurred, maintenance therapy will likely need to be continued for a longer period."

He presents to his primary care physician's office asking for some help. Which of the following medications would be most appropriate for this patient?",
        "options": [
            "A. Alprazolam",
            "B. Buspirone",
            "C. Clonazepam",
            "D. Fluoxetine",
            "E. Quetiapine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This patient is suffering from a specific or simple phobia, which in his case consists of a fear of flying. Phobias are typically treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy, but if medications are needed, benzodiazepines are often used. Since this patient's fear is situational instead of constant, giving him an SSRI like fluoxetine would be inappropriate. Alprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine, which makes it more suitable than long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam for decreasing anxiety during a short plane ride.\n(Choice B) Buspirone is used for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.\n(Choice C) Clonazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine, and although it would certainly relieve anxiety, it would also keep this patient sedated longer than necessary. The short-acting alprazolam is a better choice in this situation.\n(Choice D) An SSRI like fluoxetine can be used to treat anxiety disorders, but since this patient's phobia is specific and predictable, there is no need to prescribe a medication that has to be taken on a daily basis.\n(Choice E) Quetiapine is an antipsychotic medication that is sometimes also used to treat bipolar disorder. It has no role in the treatment of specific phobias.\nEducational objective:\nSpecific or simple phobias can be treated with benzodiazepines."
