      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "This patient's presentation suggests acute endocarditis, with confirmation pending the results of the blood cultures and cardiac imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) uses ultrasound waves generated from within the esophagus to produce clear images of the neighboring cardiac structures. The left atrium makes up the majority of the heart's posterior surface, with the esophagus passing immediately posterior to the heart. Therefore, the esophagus lies within closest proximity to the left atrium. This allows the left atrium, atrial septum, and mitral valve to be particularly well visualized on TEE. Due to its adjacent proximity conditions that result in left atrial enlargement (eg, atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis) can cause dysphagia through external compression of the esophagus.\n\n(Choice B) The left ventricle forms the apex and left border of the heart on frontal chest x-ray.\n\n(Choice C) The right atrium, along with the superior vena cava, forms the right lateral cardiac border on frontal chest x-ray.\n\n(Choice D) The right ventricle forms the anterior (sternal) surface of the heart and the majority of its inferior border.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe left atrium forms the majority of the posterior surface of the heart and resides adjacent to the esophagus. Enlargement of the left atrium can compress the esophagus and cause dysphagia."

        "D. Superior vena cava",
        "E. Tricuspid valve"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The aorta has four major divisions: the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, the descending thoracic aorta, and the abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta lies posterior and to the right of the main pulmonary artery. The aortic arch travels above the right pulmonary artery and the left bronchus. The brachiocephalic, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries originate (in that order) from its superior aspect. The descending thoracic aorta abuts the left anterior surface of the vertebral column and lies posterior to the esophagus and the left atrium. This permits clear visualization of the descending aorta during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), allowing for the detection of abnormalities such as dissection or aneurysm. The descending thoracic aorta continues to travel down the left anterior surface of the vertebral column, becoming the abdominal aorta as it crosses the diaphragm and eventually branching into the common iliac arteries.\n\n(Choice B) The main pulmonary artery ascends anteriorly and to the left of the ascending aorta and is directed toward the left shoulder. After the pulmonary artery bifurcates, the right pulmonary artery travels horizontally under the aortic arch posterior to the superior vena cava and the left pulmonary artery courses superiorly over the left main bronchus.\n\n(Choice C) The superior and inferior pulmonary veins arise bilaterally from each lung and enter the left atrium. The proximal 2-3 cm of the pulmonary veins contain cardiac muscle within the media and function like sphincters during atrial systole.\n\n(Choice D) The superior vena cava (SVC) is formed behind the right 1st costal cartilage by the merger of the right and left brachiocephalic veins. It returns blood from the head, neck, and upper extremities to the right atrium of the heart. Mediastinal neoplasms can compress the SVC and result in SVC syndrome.\n\n(Choice E) The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and right ventricle and is composed of 3 valve leaflets, the annulus, supporting chordae tendineae, and the papillary muscles. It is commonly infected (endocarditis) in IV drug users.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe descending thoracic aorta lies posterior to the esophagus and the left atrium. This position permits clear visualization of the descending aorta by transesophageal echocardiography, allowing for the detection of abnormalities such as dissection or aneurysm."

A segment of one of the leads is highlighted (arrow).\n\nThe highlighted segment most likely lies within which of the following structures?",
      "options": [
        "A. Anterior interventricular sulcus",

        "C. Pulmonary artery",
        "D. Right atrium",
        "E. Right ventricle"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This patient has a biventricular pacemaker, a device that requires 2 or 3 leads. If 3 leads are used, the first 2 are placed in the right atrium and right ventricle. The third lead is used to pace the left ventricle. Right atrial and ventricular leads are easy to place as they only need to traverse the left subclavian vein and superior vena cava to reach these cardiac chambers. In contrast, the lead that paces the left ventricle is more difficult to position. The preferred transvenous approach involves passing the left ventricular pacing lead from the right atrium into the coronary sinus, which resides in the atrioventricular groove on the posterior aspect of the heart. It is then advanced into one of the lateral venous tributaries in order to optimize left ventricular pacing.\n\n(Choice A) The anterior interventricular sulcus courses toward the apex of the heart on its anterior surface. The anterior descending vessels lie in this sulcus.\n\n(Choice C) The pulmonary artery lies just to the left of center on the anterior surface of the heart. It courses from the right ventricle toward the aortic arch. Swan-Ganz catheters traverse the pulmonary artery.\n\n(Choices D & E) The right atrium and ventricle are visible on the rightmost section of the cardiac silhouette.\n\nEducational objective:\nLeft ventricular leads in biventricular pacemakers course through the coronary sinus, which resides in the atrioventricular groove on the posterior aspect of the heart."

      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "This axial CT image shows the abdomen near the L1 vertebral level. At this level, the renal arteries originate from the aorta. The inferior vena cava (IVC) [indicated by the arrow] lies just anterior to the right renal artery and to the right of the aorta. The IVC is formed by the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the level of L4-L5 and drains into the right atrium just above the level of the diaphragm at T8. The IVC returns venous blood to the right atrium from the lower extremities, portal system, and abdominal and pelvic viscera.\n\n(Choice A) The thoracic duct drains lymph from the entire left side of the body and all regions inferior to the umbilicus (including the gut structures). It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus and empties into the left subclavian vein near its junction with the internal jugular vein.\n\n(Choice B) The cystic duct drains bile from the gallbladder into the common bile duct. The plane of this cross-sectional image is too low to see the gallbladder, but in higher sections it can be seen just below the liver in the anterior right abdomen.\n\n(Choice C) The image shows the abdominal aorta giving rise to the right and left renal arteries. The abdominal aorta lies posteromedial to the IVC within the abdomen.\n\n(Choice E) The superior mesenteric vein (SMV) joins the splenic vein to form the portal vein. The SMV can be seen vaguely near the head of the pancreas in this cross-sectional image.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe inferior vena cava (IVC) is formed by the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the level of L4-L5. The renal arteries and veins lie at the level of L1. The IVC returns venous blood to the heart from the lower extremities, portal system, and abdominal and pelvic viscera."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Right-sided endocarditis involving the tricuspid valve commonly occurs in IV drug users and is most often due to Staphylococcus aureus. Specifically, infective endocarditis can cause tricuspid regurgitation, which is identified as an early systolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border that is accentuated by inspiration.\nHeart sounds/murmurs result from reverberation of blood secondary to valve closure. Auscultation to determine function of a valve is performed at the position closest to where the sound waves reverberate and not at the position of the valve.\nAortic valve: Second right intercostal space at the right sternal border\nPulmonic valve: Second left intercostal space at the left sternal border\nTricuspid valve: Fourth left intercostal space at the lower left sternal border\nMitral valve: Fifth left intercostal space, medial to the mid-clavicular line\n\nEducational objective:\nAn early systolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border that is accentuated by inspiration is most likely due to tricuspid regurgitation."

      "question": "A 54-year-old male presents to your office complaining of periodic, tight, burning substernal chest pain. A thallium stress test shows hypoperfusion of the cardiac muscle forming the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. Which of the following coronary arteries is most likely occluded in this patient?",
      "options": [
        "A. Left anterior descending coronary artery",

        "D. Right coronary artery",
        "E. Acute marginal branches"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The right and left main coronary arteries arise directly from the root of the aorta and provide the blood supply to the heart. The left main coronary artery divides into the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex coronary arteries, which supply most of the anterior and left lateral surfaces of the heart. In 85-90% of individuals, the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery (PDA). These patients are said to have right dominant coronary circulation. In approximately 10% of patients, the posterior descending artery arises from the circumflex branch of the left main coronary artery; these patients have left dominant circulation. The posterior descending artery supplies most of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, which forms the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The right coronary artery also gives rise to the SA and AV nodal arteries in most patients.\n\n(Choice A) The LAD coronary artery normally supplies the anterior 2/3 of the interventricular septum (septal branches), the anterior wall of the left ventricle (diagonal branches), and part of the anterior papillary muscle.\n\n(Choice B) The left circumflex coronary artery supplies the lateral and posterior superior walls of the left ventricle via obtuse marginal branches.\n\n(Choice C) The left main coronary artery gives rise to the LAD and left circumflex coronary arteries. It only gives rise to the posterior descending artery in about 10% of individuals, and thus is not the artery most likely occluded here.\n\n(Choice E) The acute marginal branches arise from the right coronary artery to supply the wall of the right ventricle. They may provide collateral circulation in patients with LAD occlusion.\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe inferior wall of the left ventricle forms most of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The posterior descending artery supplies this area. In 85-90% of individuals, the posterior descending artery derives from the right coronary artery."

      "question": "A 34-year-old female is being evaluated for progressive exertional shortness of breath. She has no past medical history and does not take any medications. She does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. An echocardiographic study suggests coronary sinus dilation. Which of the following best explains this finding?",
      "options": [
        "A. Aortic dissection",
        "B. Coronary artery disease",
        "C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
        "D. Pulmonary hypertension"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The coronary sinus serves as the endpoint of venous drainage from the coronary blood supply. Since it contains deoxygenated blood it drains into the right atrium. The coronary sinus is usually not visible by echocardiography in most normal, healthy patients. The most common cause of coronary sinus dilatation evident on echocardiography is elevated right-sided heart pressure secondary to pulmonary artery hypertension. Since the coronary sinus communicates freely with the right atrium, it will become dilated by any factor that causes dilatation of the right atrium.\n\n(Choice A) Aortic dissection often occurs in patients with hypertension. Such patients might have elevated left heart pressures, but not elevated right-sided heart pressures to cause dilatation of the coronary sinus.\n\n(Choice B) Coronary artery disease typically results in less coronary artery flow, meaning less blood in the coronary sinus and hence a smaller size. The only mechanism by which coronary sinus dilatation might result from coronary artery disease would be if myocardial ischemia culminated in pulmonary artery hypertension and thus elevated right heart pressures.\n\n(Choice C) Complications from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often stem from left ventricular outflow obstruction. Coronary sinus dilatation should not occur unless there is superimposed heart failure.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe coronary sinus communicates freely with the right atrium and therefore may become dilated secondary to any factor that causes right atrial dilatation. The most common such factor is pulmonary artery hypertension, which leads to elevated right heart pressures."

        "E. Primary pulmonary hypertension",
        "F. Tension pneumothorax"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This patient presents with progressive dyspnea and orthopnea (cough when lying down). His chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly (heart > 1 hemithorax in size), increased vascular shadowing (alveolar edema) in a 'batwing' peri-hilum pattern, and blunting of the costophrenic angles (pleural effusions). These findings are characteristic of acute left ventricular failure, and result from increased left atrial and ventricular filling pressure (increased preload). This increased pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary capillaries, causing fluid transudation into the pulmonary interstitial and alveolar spaces (cardiogenic pulmonary edema).\n\nCommon triggers for acute heart failure include myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), and drug use (eg, cocaine). Patients with acute heart failure complain of cough, dyspnea, and fatigue, which can rapidly become more severe. They are typically tachypneic and may be using accessory muscles to breathe. Chest examination usually reveals crackles and sometimes wheezing (cardiac asthma) due to edema of the bronchial airways. The chest x-ray can also show Kerley B lines, short horizontal lines situated perpendicularly to the pleural surface that represent edema of the interlobular septa.\n\n(Choice A) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results from endothelial injury and leakage of fluid from capillaries. It has an acute onset and is characterized by bilateral patchy airspace disease on chest x-ray. It is caused by an inciting factor such as sepsis, aspiration, pneumonia, or trauma. ARDS can be distinguished from cardiogenic pulmonary edema by the absence of jugular venous distension and cardiomegaly.\n\n(Choice B) The chest x-ray in idiopathic interstitial fibrosis (referred to histologically as usual interstitial pneumonia) shows reticular, net-like, opacities involving the lung bases. Most patients present with slowly progressive dyspnea and a nonproductive cough.\n\n(Choice D) Obstructive pulmonary diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are associated with hyperinflated lungs and a flattened diaphragm.\n\n(Choice E) The chest x-ray in primary pulmonary hypertension reveals enlargement of the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle, which is not evident in this patient.\n\n(Choice F) The diagnosis of pneumothorax is confirmed by the presence of a white visceral pleural line on chest x-ray. Pulmonary vessels are not visible beyond the visceral pleural boundary. The mediastinum is often shifted away from the affected side.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe chest x-ray in acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema shows cardiomegaly (heart > 1 hemithorax in size), pleural effusions, Kerley B lines, and increased vascular shadowing (alveolar edema) bilaterally."

He undergoes coronary angiography and is found to have severe stenosis of the right coronary artery, left anterior descending, and circumflex coronary arteries. He is referred to a surgeon for coronary artery bypass grafting. During the procedure, a portion of his great saphenous vein is removed and grafted to 1 of his diseased coronary arteries to bypass its atherosclerotic narrowing. The saphenous vein can be best harvested from which of the following sites?",

        "D. At the midline of the popliteal fossa",
        "E. Over the lateral aspect of the foot"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "When the left anterior descending artery (LAD) alone is occluded by an atherosclerotic plaque, the left internal mammary artery (left internal thoracic artery) is the preferred vessel for bypass grafting because it has superior short- and long-term patency rates compared to saphenous vein grafts. For cases in which there are multiple coronary arteries or vessels other than the LAD requiring revascularization, saphenous vein grafts are routinely used.\n\nThe great saphenous vein is located superficially in the leg and is the longest vein in the body. It courses superiorly from the medial foot, anterior to the medial malleolus, and up the medial aspect of the leg and thigh. In the proximal anterior thigh 3-4 centimeters inferolateral to the pubic tubercle, the great saphenous vein dives deep through the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening to join the femoral vein. Surgeons commonly access the great saphenous vein in the medial leg or at its point of origin in the upper thigh near the femoral triangle. The femoral triangle is bordered by the inguinal ligament superiorly, sartorius muscle laterally, and adductor longus muscle medially.\n\n(Choice A) The deep circumflex iliac vessels course parallel to and just superior to the inguinal ligament. The superficial and inferior epigastric veins course above the midportion of the inguinal ligament.\n\n(Choice B) No major vessels are located immediately inferior to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). The ASIS serves as the superior attachment of the inguinal ligament, and a penetrating injury to the region below the ASIS could damage the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh.\n\n(Choice D) The popliteal artery and vein course centrally through the popliteal fossa together with the tibial nerve. Common medical problems that occur in the popliteal fossa include popliteal artery aneurysms, which account for the majority of peripheral artery aneurysms, and synovial (Baker) cysts, which are commonly associated with arthritis.\n\n(Choice E) The small saphenous vein can be found at the lateral aspect of the foot. This vein courses posteriorly to drain into the popliteal vein.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe great saphenous vein is a superficial vein of the leg that originates on the medial side of the foot, courses anterior to the medial malleolus, and then travels up the medial aspect of the leg and thigh. It drains into the femoral vein within the region of the femoral triangle, a few centimeters inferolateral to the pubic tubercle."

Pericardium\n9. Right ventricular myocardium\n\nIt is important to know that the right ventricle composes the majority of the anterior surface of the heart. The left lung would not be punctured by a stab wound in this location because there is no middle lobe on the left side, and the superior lobe of the left lung is displaced laterally by the cardiac impression.\n\n(Choice A) The pulmonary trunk could be pierced by a penetrating injury to the second intercostal space at the left sternal border.\n\n(Choice C) The left atrium is located at the base of the heart and makes up most of the heart's posterior surface. Only the auricle of the left atrium is visible anteriorly (protruding between the pulmonary trunk and the left ventricle).\n\n(Choice D) The left ventricle composes the left lateral aspect of the heart. A stab wound in the fourth intercostal space in the midclavicular line could potentially strike the left ventricle, but only after passing through the bulk of the left lung.\n\n(Choice E) The inferior vena cava passes through the right side of the central tendon of the diaphragm at the level of T8. A stab wound to the back to the immediate right of the vertebral bodies could strike the IVC, but the injury described above would be unlikely to.\n\nEducational Objective:\nA penetrating injury at the left sternal border in the fourth intercostal space would puncture the anterior surface of the heart.

The predilection of ulcers for the transitional zone may be due to the microenvironment having an optimal pH for Helicobacter pylori proliferation, or perhaps non-optimal local conditions induce the expression of inflammatory bacterial stress proteins.\nA number of arteries supply the stomach:\nAnatomic area | Supplying artery | Source artery\nProximal lesser curvature | Left gastric | Celiac\nDistal lesser curvature | Right gastric | Proper hepatic -> common hepatic -> celiac\nProximal greater curvature | Left gastroepiploic | Splenic -> celiac\nDistal greater curvature | Right gastroepiploic | Gastroduodenal -> common hepatic -> celiac\nProximal greater curvature above splenic artery | Short gastric arteries | Splenic -> celiac\n\nThe left and right gastric arteries run along and perfuse the lesser curvature of the stomach. They are likely to be penetrated by ulcers, leading to hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice A) The common hepatic artery perfuses the liver, gallbladder, pylorus, duodenum, and pancreas. It arises from the celiac trunk and ends when it bifurcates into the proper hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries.\n\n(Choice B) The right gastroepiploic artery arises from gastroduodenal artery and perfuses the distal greater curvature of the stomach. Gastric ulcers do not commonly occur in the greater curvature.\n\n(Choice D) The gastroduodenal artery supplies blood to the pylorus and the proximal part of the duodenum. Ulcers in the posterior duodenal bulb can erode into the gastroduodenal artery and cause bleeding.\n\n(Choices E and G) The superior mesenteric and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries do not perfuse the stomach.\n\n(Choice F) The splenic artery arises from the celiac trunk and supplies blood to the spleen. It is separated from the posterior wall of the stomach by the pancreas and is only rarely penetrated by gastric ulcers.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe great majority of gastric ulcers occur over the lesser curvature of the stomach, at the border between acid-secreting and gastrin-secreting mucosa. The left and right gastric arteries run along the lesser curvature and are likely to be penetrated by ulcers, causing gastric bleeding."

      "question": "A 56-year-old male with recent recurrent vomiting and weight loss is found to have a malignancy originating from the third part of the duodenum. Which of the following structures is at greatest risk for direct penetration by tumor?",
      "options": [
        "A. Common bile duct",
        "B. Ureter",
        "C. Superior mesenteric artery",
        "D. Portal vein",
        "E. Gastroduodenal artery"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The first part of the duodenum, the portion emerging from the pylorus of the stomach, is horizontally oriented and overlies the first lumbar vertebra. It is the only part of the duodenum that is not retroperitoneal. The second part of the duodenum courses inferiorly from the level of L1 to L3. This part of the duodenum is in close relation to the head of the pancreas. The ampulla of Vater, the site where the pancreatic and common bile ducts provide their secretions, is in the second part of the duodenum. The third part of the duodenum courses horizontally over the third lumbar vertebra, abdominal aorta, and inferior vena cava. It is in close association with the uncinate process of the pancreas and the superior mesenteric artery and vein, which puts these structures at high risk for direct invasion by a tumor in the third part of the duodenum. The fourth part of the duodenum courses superiorly and to the left of the L2 and L3 vertebrae and becomes the jejunum past the ligament of Treitz.\n\n(Choice A) The common bile duct is formed when the common hepatic bile duct and the cystic duct join in the porta hepatis region of the hepatogastric ligament. This common bile duct courses inferiorly, posterior to the pylorus and within the head of the pancreas to drain into the second part of the duodenum.\n\n(Choice B) The left ureter has no relation to the duodenum. The right ureter courses retroperitoneally posterior to the second part of the duodenum for a short length.\n\n(Choice D) The portal vein is formed retroperitoneal, posterior to the pancreas at the level of the first lumbar vertebra, by the fusion of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins. The portal vein is not in contact with the duodenum at any point.\n\n(Choice E) The gastroduodenal artery arises from the common hepatic artery and courses inferiorly, posterior to the first part of the duodenum where it then splits into the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and the right gastroepiploic artery.\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe third part of the duodenum courses horizontally across the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava at the level of the third lumbar vertebra.

      "explanation": "The splenic artery originates from the celiac artery and courses superior to the pancreas. Along its route, it gives off several branches to the stomach and pancreas before reaching the spleen. The short gastric arteries and the left gastroepiploic artery arise from the splenic artery immediately after it passes the greater curvature of the stomach. The short gastric arteries have very poor anastomoses, and the tissue supplied by them (fundus of the stomach) is vulnerable to ischemic injury following splenic artery blockage. In contrast, tissues supplied by the left gastroepiploic artery can be alternatively supplemented by its strong anastomotic connection with the right gastroepiploic artery (Choice B).\n\n(Choice A) The gastroduodenal artery supplies blood to the pylorus and the proximal part of the duodenum. It arises from the common hepatic artery.\n\n(Choice C) The right gastric artery supplies blood to the distal lesser curvature of the stomach. It arises from the proper hepatic artery.\n\n(Choice D) The right gastroepiploic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery and perfuses the distal greater curvature of the stomach.

      "question": "A 56-year-old female with a long history of gallstones presents to the emergency room complaining of cramping mid-abdominal pain, abdominal distention and vomiting for the last 12 hours. Abdominal X-ray reveals air in the gallbladder and biliary tree. In which of the following sites is a gallstone most likely lodged?",
      "options": [
        "A. Cystic duct",
        "B. Common bile duct",
        "C. Duodenum",
        "D. Jejunum",
        "E. Ileum"
      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering from gallstone ileus, a condition that occurs in patients with longstanding cholelithiasis (often middle-aged to elderly females). A large (typically 2.5 cm or greater) gallstone causes the formation of a cholecystenteric fistula between the gallbladder and adjoining gut tissue due to persistent pressure on these tissues. The fistula ultimately allows passage of the gallstone into the small bowel, and the resulting communication between the gallbladder and small bowel allows intestinal gas to enter the gallbladder and biliary tree (pneumobilia). Often this gas can be observed on abdominal X-rays.\n\nAfter entering the small bowel, the gallstone typically passes freely through the duodenum, jejunum and ileum until it encounters the ileocecal valve. The ileocecal valve typically handles material in a liquid state, and the large gallstones associated with gallstone ileus are generally unable to pass through this valve. Obstruction of the small bowel at the ileocecal valve leads to the classic signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction including abdominal pain and distention, vomiting, tenderness to palpation and tinkling bowel sounds.\n\nThe diagnosis can be made with an upper GI series to demonstrate the cholecystenteric fistula and small bowel obstruction. Treatment is by surgical removal of the offending stone. Cholecystectomy and repair of the fistula are rarely necessary.\n\n(Choices A and B) Obstruction of the cystic duct or common bile duct by a gallstone is referred to as choledocolithiasis. This can lead to biliary colic, jaundice and cholangitis. Signs and symptoms of cholangitis include fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and an inspiratory pause during right upper quadrant palpation (Murphy's sign). Free air is typically not seen in the biliary tree. Right upper quadrant ultrasound will reveal stones in the biliary ducts.\n\n(Choices C and D) The caliber of the duodenum and jejunum is typically sufficient to allow the passage of the larger gallstones that cause gallstone ileus.\n\nEducational Objective:\nGallstone ileus results from the passage of a large gallstone (typically greater than 2.5 cm) through a cholecystenteric fistula into the small bowel where it ultimately causes obstruction at the ileocecal valve. Gas is seen within the gallbladder and biliary tree on abdominal X-ray due to the presence of the fistula, and patients present with signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction."

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Given her history of dyspnea and cardiomegaly, this patient's dysphagia may be secondary to a cardiac cause. Cardiovascular dysphagia is uncommon, but when it does occur, it is usually the result of left atrial enlargement. (The left atrium is located posteriorly, directly overlying the esophagus.) Left atrial enlargement most commonly occurs in the setting of mitral stenosis and left ventricular failure. Increasing pressures in the left atrium cause distention of this chamber and pressure on the underlying esophagus.\n\n(Choice A) The right ventricle is located on the right lateral aspect of the heart and abuts the right lung.\n\n(Choice B) The right atrium is located on the anterior and superior right aspect of the heart and receives blood from the inferior and superior venae cavae as well as the coronary sinus.\n\n(Choice C) The left ventricle is located on the left lateral side of the heart and abuts the left lung.\n\n(Choice E) The pulmonary artery emerges from the right ventricle and branches into the right and left pulmonary arteries below the arch of the aorta.\n\nEducational Objective:\nCardiovascular dysphagia can result from pressure on the esophagus by a dilated left atrium.

Hindgut structures receive arterial blood from the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), a branch of the aorta. These structures are drained by the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV), which does not course with the IMA. The IMV drains blood from the hindgut into the splenic vein, which drains into the portal vein.\n\n(Choice A) The celiac trunk supplies blood to most foregut structures with the exception of the mouth, pharynx and proximal esophagus. The foregut encompasses all structures from the mouth to the second part of the duodenum.

      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "The retroperitoneum is the space located behind the peritoneal cavity. It includes the following structures:\n1. Major vessels: abdominal aorta, inferior vena cava and their branches.\n2. Solid organs: pancreas (except the tail), kidneys, adrenal glands.\n3. Hollow organs: parts 2 & 3 and a portion of part 4 of the duodenum, the ascending and descending colon (secondarily retroperitoneal), rectum, ureters and bladder.\n4. Vertebral column and pelvic muscles.\nRetroperitoneal hematomas are commonly associated with abdominal and pelvic trauma; they develop in up to half of patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Pancreatic injury with formation of a retroperitoneal hematoma can occur due to severe blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma. It can frequently be caused by direct abdominal blows from malpositioned seat belts or by steering wheels during automobile collisions. Pancreatic injury can cause mild symptoms or be asymptomatic. An abdominal CT scan should be performed in stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma to exclude the possibility of retroperitoneal hematoma.\n\n(Choice A) Though the abdominal aorta is a retroperitoneal structure, rupture of the abdominal aorta would most likely result in massive and rapid blood loss leading to hemorrhagic shock.\n\n(Choices B, C and D) The transverse colon, liver, and spleen are intraperitoneal organs. Lacerations or rupture of these organs can occur in blunt abdominal trauma, but these injuries would lead to hemoperitoneum (free blood in the peritoneal space) not retroperitoneal hematoma.\n\nEducational Objective:\nRetroperitoneal hematoma in a stable patient is likely to occur due to pancreatic injury. It may present with mild symptoms, be asymptomatic or be masked by symptoms from other injuries related to trauma. Abdominal CT is the diagnostic modality of choice. Frequently nonexpanding hematomas in this location will be treated conservatively (i.e. non-operatively)."

        "E. E"
      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "The patient described in the question stem is likely suffering from alcoholic cirrhosis. Alcoholic cirrhosis is a form of micronodular cirrhosis associated with hepatocyte death followed by fine fibrosis of the liver. As cirrhosis worsens and the number of functioning hepatocytes decreases, the functional ability of the liver diminishes. In advanced disease, portal blood has an increasingly difficult time passing through the liver because the vasculature becomes compromised by the progressive fibrosis, causing portal hypertension. Of the structures identified on the image above, only the portal and splenic veins (Choices E and C) are part of the portal venous system. In this patient, high pressure would be expected throughout the portal system, including the superior mesenteric, portal, and splenic veins. The effects of prolonged portal hypertension include varices at the four sites of portocaval anastomoses (esophagus, rectum, umbilicus, and retroperitoneal), as well as ascites.\n\nThe pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis is complex. In addition to mechanical compromise of portal vein flow by fibrotic tissue, vasoactive agents also play a role by causing dilatation of the splanchnic arterial vasculature and further intrahepatic vasoconstriction. These processes result in increased portal vein hydrostatic pressure leading to ascitic fluid formation, as well as decreased systemic perfusion pressure. The kidney senses the decreased perfusion pressure (accentuated by renal vasoconstriction in hepatorenal syndrome) and responds with avid retention of sodium and water, thus promoting further increase in ascitic fluid formation. Treatment of ascites secondary to cirrhosis involves restriction of sodium intake combined with diuretics. The most commonly prescribed initial therapy is a combination of furosemide and spironolactone.\n\n(Choice A) The descending abdominal aorta will have elevated pressures in patients with systemic hypertension.\n\n(Choice B) The inferior vena cava experiences increased pressure in cases of heart failure. This patient does not present with the typical symptoms associated with heart failure, such as lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.\n\n(Choice D) The celiac trunk emerges from the aorta at this level (T12/ L1).\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe portal vein can be identified on cross-sectional scans lying medial to (or just within) the right lobe of the liver and anterior to the inferior vena cava. The pressure in the portal system is elevated in liver cirrhosis."

        "F. Transverse portion of the duodenum"
      ],
      "answer": "F",
      "explanation": "The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) leaves the aorta at the level of L1 and supplies the intestine from the duodenum and pancreas to the left colic flexure. The transverse portion of the duodenum (third part) lies horizontally at the level of L3, passing between the aorta posteriorly and the superior mesenteric artery anteriorly. Normally, the SMA and aorta form an approximately 45 degree angle, cushioned by mesenteric fat. If this angle diminishes significantly (e.g., <20-25 degrees), often due to loss of mesenteric fat (as suggested by rapid weight loss), the transverse portion of the duodenum can get entrapped between the SMA and aorta, leading to symptoms of partial small bowel obstruction. This condition is called superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome.\n\nNarrowing of the aortomesenteric angle can occur with any condition that causes diminished mesenteric fat, including low body weight, recent weight loss, severe burns or other inducers of catabolism, and prolonged bed rest. It can also occur with pronounced lordosis or after surgical correction of scoliosis, as this procedure lengthens the spine resulting in decreased mobility of the SMA.\n\nEducational Objective:\nSuperior mesenteric artery syndrome occurs when the transverse portion of the duodenum is entrapped between the SMA and aorta, causing symptoms of partial intestinal obstruction. This syndrome occurs when the aortomesenteric angle critically decreases, secondary to diminished mesenteric fat, pronounced lordosis, or surgical correction of scoliosis."

The foregut includes the esophagus through the second part of the duodenum, the liver (Choice A), the gallbladder, and a portion of the pancreas. Unlike the spleen, the pancreas and liver develop as outpouchings of the primitive gut tube during embryogenesis.\n\n(Choice A) The liver is an endoderm-derived foregut structure that forms from a diverticulum of the primitive gut tube within the ventral mesentery.

Ulcers located on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb are more prone to perforation; those on the posterior wall are more likely to cause hemorrhage.\nThese complications are explained by the relationship of the duodenal bulb to adjacent organs. The bulb begins at the pylorus, ends at the neck of the gallbladder, and rests posterior to the gallbladder and liver. The gastroduodenal artery, common biliary duct, and portal vein lie posterior to the duodenal bulb; the head of the pancreas is located inferiorly. When an ulcer penetrates the posterior duodenal wall it is likely to erode into the gastroduodenal artery.\n\nThe gastroduodenal artery arises from the common hepatic artery and perfuses both the pylorus and the proximal part of the duodenum.

Hepatoduodenal ligament: the portion connecting to the duodenum\nBetween the 2 layers of the lesser omentum, close to the right-sided free margin, lie the hepatic artery, common bile duct, portal vein, lymphatics, and hepatic plexus. The right and left gastric arteries and gastric veins also lie between the 2 layers, near where the lesser omentum attaches to the stomach.\n\n(Choice A) The falciform ligament attaches the liver to the anterior body wall. It is a derivative of the embryonic ventral mesentery and contains the round ligament, the remnant of the fetal umbilical vein.\n\n(Choices B and C) The greater omentum is a large fold of visceral peritoneum that extends from the greater curvature of the stomach, travels inferiorly over the small intestine, and then reflects on itself and ascends to encompass the transverse colon before reaching the posterior abdominal wall. The gastrocolic ligament is the section that stretches from the greater curvature of the stomach to the transverse colon. It forms part of the anterior wall of the lesser sac and is often divided during surgery to provide access to the anterior pancreas and posterior wall of the stomach.\n\n(Choice E) The splenorenal ligament is derived from the peritoneum and lies between the left kidney and the spleen. It contains the splenic vessels and the tail of the pancreas.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe lesser omentum is a double layer of peritoneum that extends from the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and the beginning of the duodenum. It is divided into the hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal ligaments."

      "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for hematemesis that began 1 hour earlier. He has regularly consumed large amounts of alcohol for the last 20 years and has been hospitalized numerous times due to ethanol intoxication. Physical examination shows jaundice and scleral icterus. Examination of his abdomen reveals a palpable spleen and moderate ascites. Endoscopy shows bleeding esophageal varices. This patient's bleeding most likely resulted from chronic shunting of portal blood to the systemic circulation through which of the following veins?",
      "options": [
        "A. Left gastric",
        "B. Middle colic",
        "C. Paraumbilical",
        "D. Right gastroepiploic",
        "E. Splenic",
        "F. Superficial epigastric"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "This patient has numerous cirrhotic stigmata including ascites, jaundice, and splenomegaly, likely due to chronic alcoholism. An important cause of cirrhosis-related morbidity and mortality is the development of variceal hemorrhaging as a direct consequence of portal hypertension.\n\nCirrhosis (of any type) represents the endstage of progressive hepatic fibrosis. It is characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. Cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension, which arises from increased resistance to portal flow at the hepatic sinusoids. Chronic portal hypertension leads to dilation of small, pre-existing vascular channels between the portal and systemic circulations (portosystemic anastomoses). These dilated collateral vessels commonly form in the anterior abdomen (caput medusae), lower rectum (hemorrhoids), and inferior end of the esophagus (esophageal varices).\n\nEsophageal varices form due to shunting of blood from the portal system via the left gastric vein (which drains the distal esophagus and proximal stomach into the portal vein) to the systemic circulation via the esophageal veins (which drain the mid-esophagus into the azygos system -> SVC). Increased pressure in the left gastric vein due to portal hypertension causes these submucosal esophageal veins to dilate, forming varices that are prone to rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage (hematemesis).\n\n(Choice B) The middle colic vein drains the transverse colon into the SMV (portal system).\n(Choice C) Paraumbilical veins connect the portal system to superficial epigastric veins (systemic, Choice F) around the umbilicus, causing caput medusae.\n(Choice D) The right gastroepiploic vein drains the stomach into the SMV (portal system).\n(Choice E) The splenic vein is a major component of the portal system.\n\nEducational objective:\nIn cirrhosis, portal hypertension causes increased pressure in the portosystemic collateral veins within the lower end of esophagus, anterior abdomen, and lower rectum. Esophageal varices result from dilation of the connection between the left gastric vein (portal) and esophageal veins (systemic/azygos)."

      "question": "A 48-year-old male presents to your office with recent weight loss and vague abdominal pain. He admits to drinking alcohol regularly, but denies any past medical problems. A 72-hour stool collection reveals excessive excretion of neutral fat. Involvement of which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? [Image shows CT with structures A(Duodenum), B(Pancreas), C(IVC), D(Aorta), E(Jejunum) marked]",
      "options": [
        "A. A",
        "B. B",
        "C. C",
        "D. D",
        "E. E"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The patient described in the question stem is suffering from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which is evidenced by steatorrhea (excessive excretion of neutral fat) leading to weight loss and abdominal pain. Chronic pancreatitis, often caused by chronic alcoholism, is a common cause of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to destruction of acinar cells that produce digestive enzymes (lipase, amylase, proteases). Structure B in the image represents the pancreas.\n\nThe head, neck, and body of the pancreas are retroperitoneal, while the tail is peritoneal. The head of the pancreas lies in the curve of the duodenum and overlies the L2 vertebra. The body overlies the L1 and L2 vertebrae and makes contact posteriorly with the aorta, the superior mesenteric vessels, and the left kidney. The tail of the pancreas courses within the splenorenal ligament alongside the splenic vessels.\n\n(Choice A) This structure is the second (descending) part of the duodenum.\n\n(Choice C) This structure is the inferior vena cava (IVC). The IVC lies on the right side of the vertebrae in a retroperitoneal position.\n\n(Choice D) This structure labels the abdominal aorta. The aorta in this region lies on the left side of the vertebrae in a retroperitoneal position.\n\n(Choice E) These structures are loops of the jejunum. At this level in the abdominal cavity, loops of small bowel represent jejunum. If this CT slice were of the inferior (lower) abdomen, the small bowel would more likely be the ileum.\n\nEducational Objective:\nOn abdominal CT scans, the pancreas can be identified by its head in close association with the second part of the duodenum; by its body overlying the left kidney, aorta, IVC and superior mesenteric vessels; and also by the tail lying in the splenorenal ligament. Chronic pancreatitis leads to exocrine insufficiency and steatorrhea."
