    "question": "A 33-year-old woman develops a painful. swollen right knee. Culture of the joint fluid aspirate grows organisms on chocolate agar but not on blood agar The most likely causal organism has which of the following properties?",
    "options": [
      "A. antigenically variable pili",
      "B. Both hyphae and spores",
      "C. Cannot make ATP",
      "D. No true cell wall",
      "E. Visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Having both hyphae and spores (choice B) would be true of Candida, which usually causes arthritis as a rare complication of systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma do not have true cell walls (choice D) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete that is visible only with darkfield microscopy (choice E) or direct fluorescent antibody. Secondary syphilis can (uncommonly) cause an acute arthritis, but syphilis is rare in an otherwise healthy adult."

    "question": "A 10-year-old boy develops an abscess on his left knee. Examination of the exudate shows neutrophils containing mixed bacterial flora. Which of the following is the most important virulence factor for bacterial survival within the phagolysosome?",
    "options": [
      "A. catalase",
      "B. Hemolysin",
      "C. Hyaluronidase",
      "D. streptokinase",
      "E. Tetanospasmin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome. Tetanospasmin (choice E) is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It inhibits the inhibitory mediators glycine and GABA, and promotes the rigid paralysis of tetanus. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome."

    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of sore throat and a fever. Physical examination shows pharyngeal erythema with a tonsillar abscess. Culture of oropharyngeal secretions on sheep's blood agar grows colonies of gram-positive cocci that are surrounded by a zone of complete hemolysis. Another culture of the secretions on mannitol salt agar grows well and causes the medium to turn yellow. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "E. Streptococcus salivarius"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx; constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx and a tonsillar exudate. Streptococcus salivarius (choice E) is a gram-positive coccus that is usually alpha-hemolytic. It is normal flora of the oral cavity and is sometimes implicated in subacute bacterial endocarditis, but is not associated with tonsillar abscesses."

    "options": [
      "A. Streptococcus agalactiae",
      "B. Streptococcus bovis",
      "C. Streptococcus mutans",
      "D. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "E. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "F. Streptococcus sanguis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Streptococcus bovis is a group D Streptococcus. There is a significant association between S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon and other colonic diseases. Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are reported to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. The group D Streptococci are distinguished by having a cell wall carbohydrate composed of glycerol teichoic acid. S. agalactiae (choice A) is a group B Streptococcus that is the number-one cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia in the United States. S. mutans and S. sanguis (choices C and F) are viridans streptococci, which are normal flora of the oral mucosa. While they are associated with bacterial endocarditis, it is usually associated with invasive dental work and a preexisting heart valve defect. S. pneumoniae (choice D) which is a non-groupable Streptococcus (it does not have a C cell wall carbohydrate), is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in the United States. S. pyogenes (choice E) is a group A Streptococcus and is associated with pharyngitis, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of a several month history of chronic fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. Laboratory studies show that he is HIV-positive by ELISA and Western blot. His CD4 cell count is 525/mm³. He declines anti-retroviral therapy. Which of the following sets of findings is most likely at his next visit?",
    "options": [
      "A. Virus, p24, RNA Increasing | CD4+ Decreasing | Anti-p24 Decreasing | Anti-env Increasing slightly",
      "B. Virus, p24, RNA Increasing | CD4+ Decreasing | Anti-p24 Increasing | Anti-env Decreasing slightly",
      "C. Virus, p24, RNA Increasing | CD4+ No change | Anti-p24 Increasing | Anti-env Decreasing slightly",
      "D. Virus, p24, RNA Decreasing | CD4+ Normal | Anti-p24 No change | Anti-env No change",
      "E. Virus, p24, RNA Undetectable | CD4+ Normal | Anti-p24 Decreasing | Anti-env Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 525/mm³, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient, measured by RT-PCR for viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Antibodies against the envelope glycoproteins are generally IgM, which does not require a primary immune response. The IgM anti-env antibody can be made in the absence of TH cells. Increasing p24 virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood. This does not happen in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy."

    "question": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dysmenorrhea and lower abdominal tenderness. A pelvic examination shows adnexal tenderness and a mucopurulent discharge without blood Examination of cervical cells shows intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies when stained with Giemsa stain. Which of the following properties is characteristic of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. It has sterols in its membrane",
      "B. It lacks a cell wall",
      "C. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol",
      "D. Its cell wall contains mycolic acids",
      "E. It uses an elementary body to infect cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This young woman is infected with Chlamydia trachomatis the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells. It has sterols in its membrane (choice A) is a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These are the only prokaryotes that totally lack a cell wall, but instead have sterols in their membranes. It lacks a cell wall (choice B) is also a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These prokaryotes are devoid of a cell wall but have sterols in their membranes. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol (choice C) is a statement that describes the fungi. The ergosterol molecule is unique to fungi and is the target molecule for nystatin and the imidazoles. A cell wall containing mycolic acids (choice D) describes the genus Mycobacterium. Mycolic acids are long-chain fatty acids that give this group its resistance to environmental stresses and its acid-fast staining characteristics."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of recurrent growth of a whitish film on his tongue and buccal mucosa. There is no evidence of esophageal involvement. A scraping of the lesion is placed in a test tube containing animal serum and the results of this evaluation are shown in the photomicrograph. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug of choice for this patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. It blocks ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase",
      "B. It inhibits the CYP450—dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase",
      "C. It inhibits the synthesis of beta-glucan",
      "D. It interferes with mitotic spindle function",
      "E. It interferes with thymidylate synthetase and DNA synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test, the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the “conazole” antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A). This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patients oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum. Flucytosine interferes with thymidylate synthetase (choice E). This agent is used in the treatment of cryptococcosis. It is contraindicated in HIV patients, as it may cause bone marrow suppression in those patients."

    "question": "A medical virology laboratory coinfects cells in a tissue culture flask with influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1). The flask is incubated for 48 hours and the progeny viruses are analyzed. Four distinct variants of influenza A are isolated: H3N2, H1N1, H3N1, and H1N2 Which of the following viral attributes most likely made the production of H3N1 and H1N2 variants possible?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. High mutational rate",
      "C. Phenotypic mixing",
      "D. segmented genome",
      "E. Syncytia formation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

Physical examination shows swelling and tenderness over the left mastoid bone. The most likely causal organism is also responsible for causing which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ecthyma gangrenosum",
      "B. Erythema migrans",
      "C. Food poisoning",
      "D. Nonmycotic mycetoma",
      "E. Pharyngitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes malignant otitis externa which is a severe necrotizing infection of the external ear canal. Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone, temporal bone, sigmoid sinus, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Patients at increased risk include the elderly, people with diabetes, and the immunocompromised. Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes (since the organism can be cultured from the shoes), burn infections, and pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients. Ecthyma gangrenosum is the name of the characteristic lesion that occurs during Pseudomonas septicemias. It has a black, necrotic center and a raised hemorrhagic ring outside. Erythema migrans (choice B) is the target-shaped rash that occurs in the early stages of Lyme disease. Food poisoning (choice C) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas. Nonmycotic mycetoma (choice D) is caused by Actinomyces and Nocardia. Pharyngitis (choice E) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas."

      "D. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus",
      "E. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, naked, icosahedral virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Outbreaks occur seasonally in winter and early spring. Infection does not result in lasting immunity, and reinfection can occur. The virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, a group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are nonsegmented, helical, and enveloped. Double-stranded DNA, naked, icosahedral virus (choice A) describes the Adenoviruses, which are capable of causing conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. However, these agents are not common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Negative-sense single-stranded RNA with eight segments, helical, enveloped virus (choice C) describes the Orthomyxoviruses, which include influenza virus. Influenza is a systemic illness characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache myalgias, malaise, and prostration, followed by cough, nasal obstruction, and sore throat. The lower respiratory tract may also be involved. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus (choice D) describes the Coronaviruses, which cause the common cold (nasal obstruction and discharge, sneezing, mild or no fever, occasional sore throat, and/or cough) and acute pharyngitis (sore throat with or without cervical adenopathy, ulceration, and conjunctivitis). SARS-CoV also belongs to this family and causes a seasonal acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is usually imported into this hemisphere from the Far East. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA naked, icosahedral virus (choice E) describes the Picornaviruses and Caliciviruses. Within the Picornaviridae, rhinoviruses cause the common cold but would not be common agents of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants."

    "options": [
      "A. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes",
      "B. Introns",
      "C. Points of bacteriophage insertion",
      "D. Points of site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. A resistance transfer factor is a bacterial plasmid that encodes one or more drug-resistance genes and has the capability of mediating its own transfer to another bacterium during conjugation (it possesses the F operon). Most of the known resistance transfer factors have been formed by the accumulation of transposons into fertility factor plasmids. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are capable of movement within bacterial cells. When they carry drug-resistance genes and accumulate in plasmids that already possess the F operon, multiple drug-resistant plasmids (resistance transfer factors) are formed. The flanking sequences in the DNA of a transposon are indirect repeats that are complementary and antiparallel to one another. When transposons insert themselves into a new location, they do so by site-specific recombination, creating direct repeats (identical nucleotide sequences created during the repair of a staggered cut created by the transposon restriction endonuclease). Therefore, in the diagram shown, the rectangular blocks could represent either the direct repeats caused by transposition or the indirect repeats that are the outside edges of the mobile segments of DNA. In either event, they are representations of points at which transposons have inserted their mobile DNA via site-specific recombination. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes (choice A) is not correct. Although each transposon (and there are three that have moved to create the resistance transfer factor shown) carries its own restriction endonuclease and the gene that encodes it, the diagram clearly shows the presence of two rectangles for each of the transposons, and a given transposon would carry only one copy, not two copies, of its endonuclease gene. Introns (choice B) are repetitive, non-transcribed segments of DNA that do not occur in prokaryotes. Points of bacteriophage insertion (choice C) or insertion sequences are palindromic sequences of nucleotides in a bacterial genome that are identical to those found in the genomes of temperate phages. When these sequences are cleaved by a restriction endonuclease the phage genome can be inserted by site-specific recombination into the bacterial chromosome and the state of lysogeny is begun. Bacteriophages are not involved in the formation of resistance transfer factors. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are responsible for the formation of multiple drug-resistant plasmids such as the one shown here, but they are not represented by the rectangular blocks. In the diagram, the transposons are the sequences between the rectangular blocks, so there are three transposons that accumulated here to create this resistance transfer factor."

She says that she had bloody diarrhea for the last 4 weeks of her trip. A CT scan of the abdomen shows lesions that appear to be multiple abscesses. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "C. Enterobius vermicularis",
      "D. Salmonella typhi",
      "E. Shigella species"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient probably has hepatic amebiasis, which is a life-threatening complication of intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. E. histolytica is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Intestinal colonization (which may be asymptomatic) always precedes infection of the liver. The abscesses generally contain necrotic debris, with amoebas located along the edges of the abscess. Treatment for liver abscesses of this origin is metronidazole, while iodoquinol is useful to destroy the luminal stages of the parasite. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) can cause intestinal obstruction, and may cause abscesses if it invades the common bile duct. It would not cause bloody diarrhea. Enterobius vermicularis (choice C) is the pinworm, which inhabits the rectum. Bloody diarrhea can also be seen with some strains of Salmonella (choice D) and Shigella (choice E), but these organisms do not usually cause hepatic abscesses. Bacterial causes of hepatic abscesses include E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas."

      "E. Septate hyphae at 45-degree angles",
      "F. spherules"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This is a classic case of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis. Clues include the patient population (HIV-positive), and the CSF findings suggesting a fungal etiology. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal meningitis of the immunocompromised in the United States. It is a monomorphic fungus, unlike many of the classic pathogens within the fungal group, so the encapsulated yeast form would be found both in clinical specimens and in the environment as the infectious form. Broad-based, budding yeasts (choice A) would be the forms expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Blastomyces dermatitidis - which is far more likely to present with skin and bone lesions than with meningitis. Budding yeasts in a 'pilot's wheel' arrangement (choice B) would be the form expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis which is limited in geographic region to Central and South America and typically presents as a primary pulmonary disease. Intracellular yeasts within macrophages (choice D) are the diagnostic form of Histoplasma capsulatum which, despite its name, is not an encapsulated yeast. It is primarily a pulmonary infection acquired by exposure to the droppings of birds or bats. Septate hyphae with 45-degree angles (choice E) are the transmission forms of Aspergillus which is a major opportunistic infection. Aspergillus may cause meningitis in this patient population, but it is not nearly as common as Cryptococcus. Spherules (choice F) would be the yeast forms characteristic of Coccidioides immitis which may be a cause of fungal meningitis in immunologically compromised individuals but is geographically restricted to the Sonoran desert zone of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever)."

      "D. Hydrocephalus",
      "E. Non-immune hydrops"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. There are two parts to this question. The first is realizing that the student's illness is the classic description of Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum. It is caused by parvovirus B19, which is spread from human to human. Animals do not carry this particular parvovirus. The disease is contagious prior to the onset of the rash. The initial symptoms, during the period of contagion, are nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, myalgia, lethargy, coryza, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain. When the typical 'slapped-cheek' rash begins, the student is no longer contagious. The rash begins with the erythematous cheeks, then the upper part of the body becomes red and then reticulated, i.e., the typical lacy appearance of the rash develops. This fades but can come and go for the next 3 weeks. Parvovirus is a cause of aplastic anemia. It may be responsible for aplastic crises in patients with sickle-cell anemia. In addition, exposure of a pregnant woman in the first trimester may result in a fetus with aplastic anemia, which results in non-immune hydrops fetalis. Because the virus infects immature erythrocytes, causing severe anemia, the fetus dies of cardiac failure. Congenital heart defects (choice A) may occur due to many different reasons. They are, however associated with the congenital rubella syndrome, in which a patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis are most commonly seen. Cutaneous scarring (choice B) occurs in an infant with congenital varicella syndrome (exposure to varicella during pregnancy). The other major feature is limb defects. Hemolytic anemias (choice C) are usually not associated with prenatal exposure to an infectious agent. They may be produced due to isoimmunization (Rh disease), red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis), or red cell enzyme defects (pyruvate kinase deficiency), as well as many other etiologies. Hydrocephalus (choice D) also has diverse etiologies. There is an association with prenatal exposure to mumps and the fetal development of aqueductal stenosis resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus."

    "question": "An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a fever, sore throat, and rash. Physical examination shows an exudative pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy and tenderness, and a diffuse, sandpaper-like erythematous rash. Which of the following mechanisms is responsible for the expression of the toxin that produces these signs?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Homologous recombination",
      "C. Lysogenic conversion",
      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The question describes a girl with streptococcal pharyngitis with a characteristic rash. This combination is scarlet fever, and is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes via its erythrogenic exotoxin (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, SPE). SPE-A, SPE-B, and SPE-C. The production of this extra virulence is an example of lysogenic conversion. In this case, the DNA of a temperate phage is inserted into the bacterial chromosome and produces a prophage. Besides the repressor protein, the prophage DNA also directs the synthesis of other gene products that make the bacteria more pathogenic. Conjugation (choice A) is one of the three methods whereby DNA is transferred from one cell to another. In this case, it is done by cell-to-cell contact. It is not the means by which the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins are expressed. Homologous recombination (choice B) is a gene exchange process that stabilizes some genes that have been introduced by conjugation, transformation, or transduction. During the process there is an exchange of pieces of DNA between a linear piece of DNA and a region on the stable circular bacterial chromosome. In site-specific recombination (choice D) a DNA molecule is integrated into a molecule of DNA with which it has no homology, except for a small site on each DNA that is called an insertion site. The end result is the sum of the two original DNA molecules. Transformation (choice E) is another way in which genes are transferred. In this case, naked DNA is taken up by another cell. Cells that can take up naked DNA from the environment need to become competent, and do so under certain environmental conditions. The newly introduced DNA is generally linear, homologous DNA from the same type of cell, but one that may be genetically diverse. Once introduced into the new cell, some genes may become stabilized by homologous recombination."

    "question": "During an investigational study, new combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules are found on the progeny viruses of a prevalent serotype of the swine influenza virus and the prevalent serotype of the human influenza virus. The progeny viruses are genetically stable when purified and are used to infect new tissue cultures. Which of the following mechanisms most likely accounts for the production of the new viral progeny?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. Genetic drift",
      "C. Genetic shift",
      "D. Phenotypic masking",
      "E. Phenotypic mixing"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza and other viruses with segmented genomes (Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus) are capable of genetic reassortment. This is an accidental 'shuffling' of the segments of genomic RNA so that new genetic combinations can be produced. Viruses that have segmented genomes have multiple pieces of RNA that must be assembled correctly in the progeny to produce a new generation that is identical to the parental generation. When accidental rearrangements occur, genetic shift results; and in influenza, this is responsible for the production of pandemics of disease. Complementation (choice A) occurs when two viruses infect a single cell. If one is defective in a certain gene product, progeny viruses can be produced as long as that defect can be 'complemented' by the makeup of the other virus. If both viruses have the same defect, no progeny viruses can be produced. In the case given here, two viable viruses were grown in a single cell and new combinations of surface molecules were produced. Genetic drift (choice B) refers to random mutational changes that can occur in any reproducing organism. These changes can change the surface of the organism, which affects the host immune response to the organism. Changes such as these are more gradual than genetic shift, and are best described in viruses such as HIV. Phenotypic masking (choice D) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is created from the genome of one of the viruses while the genome included in the capsid is from the other virus. Thus, one genome is 'masked' or covered with the antigens of the other virus. In the case described here, combinations of surface molecules were expressed. Phenotypic mixing (choice E) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is a mixture of the capsid antigens from the two parental viruses. Since the genomic RNA is not actually reassorted in that case, it would not be a stable genetic change but simply a reflection of the antigens of both parental viruses being inserted on the surfaces of a single progeny generation."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This case is classic for rheumatic fever which is diagnosed by a positive Jones criteria (2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria) in the presence of a previous history of Streptococcus infection. Major criteria: Migratory polyarthritis, Carditis, Subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, Erythema marginatum, Sydenham chorea. Minor criteria: Fever, Arthralgia Joint pain without swelling, Laboratory abnormalities; increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, Electrocardiogram abnormalities: a prolonged PR interval, Evidence of Group A Strep infection: elevated Antistreptolysin O titer, or DNAase, Previous rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease. Rheumatic fever is a sequela of untreated infection with group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes). Strep. pyogenes is differentiated from the other beta-hemolytic streptococci by its sensitivity to the antibiotic bacitracin. The catalase test (choice A) is used to differentiate staphylococci from streptococci. Staphylococci are catalase-positive; streptococci are catalase-negative. Strep. pyogenes is catalase-negative. The coagulase test (choice B) is used to differentiate Staphylococcus aureus from the other staphylococcus species. Staph. aureus is coagulase-positive; the others are coagulase-negative. Sensitivity to novobiocin (choice D) is used to differentiate Staph. saprophyticus (resistant) from Staph. epidermidis (sensitive). Sensitivity to Optochin (choice E) is used to differentiate Strep. pneumoniae (sensitive) from viridans streptococci (resistant)."

      "B. Gram-negative rods",
      "C. Gram-positive cocci",
      "D. Gram-positive diplococci",
      "E. Gram-positive rods"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen that is associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and that commonly causes cystitis. It is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod that reduces nitrates to nitrites. It is important to know that the pili and motility of the bacteria contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with cystitis can develop bacteremia and subsequent septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The present patient has an obstructive lesion of the urinary tract that predisposes him to the overgrowth of microorganisms such as E. coli. Pulmonary symptoms are consistent with ARDS. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) might be a Neisseria sp. or Moraxella catarrhalis. N. gonorrhoeae is the cause of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that presents asymptomatically or with urethritis. Patients are usually younger and sexually active. M. catarrhalis is usually implicated as a cause of otitis media and sinusitis in children. It is also implicated as a cause of purulent tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in a population of patients who are older than 50 years and who have underlying obstructive lung disease. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis rarely cause cystitis. S. saprophyticus causes UTIs but the patients are typically young, sexually active women. Enterococcus is a relatively common cause of UTIs in hospitalized patients with indwelling urinary catheters who are receiving broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Enterococcal bacteremia can lead to endocarditis, but would not commonly cause ARDS. Gram-positive diplococci (choice D) would be a description of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Gram-positive rods (choice E) would include members of the following genera: Clostridium, Bacillus, Listeria, and Corynebacterium. The only significant member of this group to produce UTIs is Corynebacterium urealyticum (C. jeikeium). This organism creates an alkaline urine environment with the potential for stone formation. Patients are usually immunocompromised or have had recurrent UTIs."

      "B. Flaviviridae",
      "C. Hepadnaviridae",
      "D. Hepeviridae",
      "E. Picornaviridae"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Hepatitis E is an important cause of epidemics of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. These infections are most common in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America and are associated with a very high mortality among pregnant women. Hepatitis E is caused by a naked capsid RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae (formerly Caliciviridae). Adenoviridae (choice A) is a group of naked capsid double-stranded DNA viruses that may cause upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis, but are not generally associated with hepatitis. Flaviviridae (choice B) is the family to which hepatitis C virus belongs. This is an enveloped RNA virus that is usually transmitted sexually or parenterally, and although it is associated with a high degree of chronicity and carcinogenesis, it is not usually a cause of high mortality among pregnant women. Hepadnaviridae (choice C) is the family to which hepatitis B virus belongs. It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that is sexually or parenterally transmitted. It is associated with the production of chronic infections and hepatocellular carcinoma, but is not known for causing high mortality among pregnant women. Picornaviridae (choice E) is the family of naked capsid RNA viruses to which hepatitis A virus belongs. Although this virus is fecal-orally transmitted and therefore more common in developing countries, it is not associated with a high degree of mortality in pregnant women."

In one experiment, the nuclei of these cells are removed by cytosurgery, and various viral agents are added to the cultures, Following culture of the viruses with the enucleated cells, the yield of cytopathic units of virus is quantified. Which of the following viruses would be capable of replication in these enucleated cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Cytomegalovirus",
      "C. Influenza virus",
      "D. JC virus",
      "E. Poliovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Most RNA viruses (e.g., poliovirus) replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore can replicate in enucleated cells. Poliovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae. These viruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA. The exception to the rule regarding RNA viruses is the family Orthomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses (choice C). Orthomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral mRNA transcription. Adenoviruses (choice A) are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome. All DNA viruses except the family Poxviridae carry out their replication in the nucleus, and therefore would not be capable of completing their life cycles in enucleated cells. Cytomegalovirus (choice B) is a member of family Herpesviridae. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome, and thus replicates in the nucleus. JC virus (choice D) belongs to family Polyomaviridae. It is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded circular DNA genome. It would not be able to complete its life cycle in an enucleated cell."

    "question": "A total of 2 x 10² Streptococcus viridans are inoculated into a flask containing 1 L of enriched broth. If the lag time is 30 minutes and the generation time is 20 minutes, how many bacteria will there be in the culture after 2.5 hours?",
    "options": [
      "A. 6 x 10²",
      "B. 12 x 10²",
      "C. 16 x 10²",
      "D. 32 x 10²",
      "E. 128 x 10²"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. During the lag time by definition, bacteria newly introduced into a culture will undergo metabolic changes necessary for use of the medium, but will not increase in number. Therefore, at the end of the first 30 minutes of elapsed time the number of bacteria in the culture will be 2 x 10². Thereafter, the number of bacteria will double every 20 minutes (the definition of 'generation time'). This means that after 2.5 hours (150 minutes) of total elapsed time, 120 minutes (150 min - 30 min lag) will be available for growth. Since generation time is 20 minutes, six generations will have occurred (120 min / 20 min/gen = 6 gen). So the original inoculum will double six times: 2 x 10² * 2⁶ = 2 x 10² * 64 = 128 x 10². Choice A (6 x 10²) is not the correct answer. The student who selects this answer forgot that lag periods occur only once per culture, and also incorrectly multiplied the starting inoculum number by an incorrect number of generations (three). Choice B (12 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of counting the number of possible generations and multiplying by that number. Remember that every generation time means that every bacterium in that culture has divided into two, so the student must multiply by 2 six times, or 2⁶. Choice C (16 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of forgetting that the lag time occurs only one time per culture. The student who selects this answer divided the 2.5 hours of culture time between three lag periods and three correctly calculated generations (2³). Choice D (32 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of including the lag period within the first generation time (overlapping the two, and forgetting that they are distinct and separate periods). The student who did this would therefore count five possible generations and, multiplying correctly thereafter by 2⁵, would arrive at this incorrect answer."

He reports having a unilateral, vesicular rash 1 month ago Treatment with acyclovir is begun, but he dies on the fourth day after admission. Which of the following viruses is most likely responsible for the development of encephalitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus",
      "B. Herpes simplex type-1",
      "C. Herpes simplex type-2",
      "D. Herpes zoster",
      "E. Measles virus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The specific clue to the cause of the severe encephalitis in this AIDS patient is the history of shingles, due to reactivation of the herpes zoster (varicella zoster) virus. In otherwise healthy adults, the virus (which is usually introduced to the body as a childhood case of chickenpox) remains dormant in a dorsal root ganglion only to reactivate in later life, causing a painful vesicular eruption that characteristically conforms to the distribution of a single dermatome. In AIDS patients, the virus can cause a severe multifocal encephalitis that may be resistant to acyclovir therapy. Cytomegalovirus (choice A) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but is less likely in the present patient, given his past history of shingles. Herpes simplex type-1 (choice B) and type-2 (choice C) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but are less likely in this patient, given his past history of shingles and the lack of response to acyclovir. Measles virus (choice E) appears to be related to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis but this condition is not specifically increased in AIDS patients."

      "H. Shigatoxin",
      "I. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins",
      "J. Tetanus toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient's wound is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the characteristic lesion described is called ecthyma gangrenosum. The Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which is responsible for the tissue damage, inhibits protein synthesis by acting on EF-2, with a primary target cell in the liver. The diphtheria toxin has a similar action, although its target cells are heart and nerve. Anthrax toxin (choice A) is a three-component toxin that contains a single binding component (protective antigen) and two active components. The edema factor (EF) is an adenylate cyclase that causes fluid loss from cells, and the lethal factor (LF) is an endoprotease that causes apoptosis. Botulinum toxin (choice B) is a neurotoxin that prevents neurosecretory vesicles from fusing with synaptic membranes and releasing acetylcholine. Cholera toxin (choice C) acts to increase adenylate cyclase activity by ribosylation of GTP-binding protein. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (choice D) is a lecithinase. Escherichia coli labile toxin (choice F) works in a fashion similar to the cholera toxin. Pertussis toxin (choice G) causes fluid loss by ribosylating Gi. Shigatoxin (choice H) decreases protein synthesis by inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins (choice I) act as superantigens to increase cytokine production. Tetanus toxin (choice J) is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA."

      "A. It contains an episome",
      "B. It contains free plasmid DNA",
      "C. It contains a prophage",
      "D. It is not a diphtheroid",
      "E. It is a motile organism"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has developed diphtheria, which is rare in the United States because of our use of a very effective vaccine, the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis). Immigrant children from impoverished areas of the globe might not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is a gram-positive rod that is morphologically identical to normal flora organisms in the oropharynx, which are called diphtheroids. The difference between the pathogen and a normal flora diphtheroid is established using the ELEK test, which is shown in the image. This test involves diffusion in gel and a precipitation reaction that will occur when antigen (toxin) produced by the pathogen precipitates in the presence of antitoxin antibodies. In the image, the horizontal lines are the strains of bacteria to be tested for the production of the toxin. The vertical rectangle is a strip of filter paper that has been soaked in antitoxin antibodies. The white lines that form in the right angle where bacteria and filter paper meet are lines of precipitation. In C. diphtheriae, toxin production occurs following infection of the bacterium with a temperate phage that encodes the toxin. This is an example of lysogenic conversion. Episomes (choice A) are plasmids that have integrated into a bacterial chromosome; Diphtheria toxin is produced following stable integration of a phage genome into the chromosome, not due to the integration of plasmid DNA. Containing free plasmid DNA (choice B) is not the distinction between toxin-producing and non-producing strains of C. diphtheriae. The tetanus toxin is produced by virtue of possession of a non-conjugative plasmid by Clostridium tetani, but this is not true of diphtheria. It is not a diphtheroid (choice D). A diphtheroid is a non-toxin producing strain of C. diphtheriae (a normal flora organism). The strains that are streaked in the image as the two central lines are non-toxin producers (diphtheroids). It is a motile organism (choice E) is not the case and motility is not tested by the ELEK test. C. diphtheriae is a nonmotile organism, and the eventual development of peripheral neuropathies and cardiomyopathies during the pathogenesis are a result of the fact that the toxin becomes bloodborne, not that the organism moves from its site of residence in the oropharynx and upper airways."

    "options": [
      "A. A boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod",
      "B. A cigar-shaped yeast",
      "C. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine",
      "D. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining",
      "E. A large spirochete"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causative organism, Bacillus anthracis is found in many animal species, and humans can acquire the organism either through contact with animals or from locally contaminated soil. The pustule described in the question stem is called a 'malignant pustule' and may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy. Malignant pustules after rupture form a black eschar surrounded by edema. Most cases remain localized but death can occur as the result of complications such as bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Bacillus is a large, boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod that forms spores centrally placed inside the bacillus, so that they look like bamboo shoots. A cigar-shaped yeast (choice B) describes the tissue form of Sporothrix schenckii, the agent of rose-gardener's disease. The lesion in such a case would be a mycetoma, draining yellow granular pus through multiple sinus tracts. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine (choice C) describes Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. The organism can persist for weeks to months but does not form spores that could survive for hundreds or thousands of years. Most human cases occur in the endemic areas of the United States, in Arkansas and Missouri. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining (choice D) describes Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague. This organism does not form stable spores that can survive for extended periods of time. The hallmark of bubonic plague is the formation of buboes which are black, necrotic lymph nodes that form at the site of the vector fleabite. A large spirochete (choice E) describes Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme disease. In the first stage of this disease, there is a localized, expanding, erythematous rash rather than an eschar. Furthermore, Lyme disease occurs in the United States, Europe, and Asia, corresponding to the distribution of Ixodes ticks, which spread the infection."

      "E. Monomorphic yeast",
      "F. Septate hyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in this case are consistent with a fungal infection in the central nervous system (100-1000 cells, mostly lymphocytes, glucose <50 mg/dL, protein >=50 mg/dL). Cryptococcus is a monomorphic encapsulated yeast. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. While this patient is in the appropriate age group for meningococcal meningitis, his HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Gram-negative rods (choice B) would be indicative of any of the enteric organisms, particularly Escherichia coli. E. coli is an agent of neonatal meningitis and septicemia, but the patient's HIV status, age, and CSF findings refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) would be indicative of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of adult meningitis, but the CSF findings in this case refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive rods (choice D) would be indicative of Listeria monocytogenes, which also could be a feasible answer but again, the patient's HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Septate hyphae (choice F) would describe Aspergillus fumigatus, which is another fungal agent of meningitis in the immunocompromised, but it is not the most likely cause."

      "D. The patient is in the window period",
      "E. The patient is making an excess of HBsAb"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has clearly returned from Calcutta with an active infection of hepatitis B, since his serum is positive for antibody against the core antigen of hepatitis B. This is the standard diagnostic for this infection. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb from the serum reflects that the patient has entered the 'window period,' a good prognostic indicator because it demonstrates that antibodies to the surface antigen are being made in enough concentration to precipitate the corresponding antigen out of the circulation. Successful vaccination against hepatitis B (choice A) would be reflected by a positive titer of HBsAb only. The presence of antibody against the e core antigen reflects the existence of an active infection. Anergy to hepatitis B (choice B) is not correct because a person who is anergic is selectively unresponsive or tolerant to the antigen in question. Clearly, the presence of antibodies to several of these viral antigens in the serum demonstrates that this patient is not anergic. Although the patient is beginning to mount a protective immune response (antibody to HBsAg, choice C), it has not yet reached a protective level. If the patient were making an excess of HBsAb (choice E), there would be a rising titer of HBsAb. Thus the patient would be positive for HBsAb and negative for HBsAg."

    "question": "An investigator is conducting a study of resistance of enterococcal species against penicillin and tetracycline. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for the acquisition of this type of multi-drug resistance?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacteriophage",
      "B. Exogenotes",
      "C. Prophage",
      "D. Restriction endonuclease",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Transposons are mobile segments of DNA that can move themselves or a copy of themselves from one molecule of DNA to another. They are found in eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. They need at least one gene coding for a transposase, which are the enzymes involved in this movement. The transposase recognizes a specific nucleotide sequence, and the DNA inserts into this position. This insertion creates direct repeats on each side of the transposon. Transposons include some genes for drug resistance and play an important role in building multiple-drug resistance plasmids. These multi-drug resistance plasmids have played a major role in the explosive spread of drug resistances throughout the bacterial world. Bacteriophages (choice A) are viruses that infect the bacterial cell. Temperate phage DNA may be inserted into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Imported bacterial DNA (i.e., DNA that has been transferred into a cell by conjugation, transformation, or transduction) is on short linear pieces of DNA called exogenotes (choice B). Most linear DNA is not stable in cells because it is broken down by exonucleases. Although technically all transferred DNA involved in emerging drug resistances is of exogenote origin, this is not the best answer because it is not specific enough. A prophage (choice C) is a repressed temperate phage DNA inserted into a bacterial chromosome. The prophage DNA may encode the synthesis of products that make bacteria more pathogenic. This enhanced virulence is called lysogenic conversion. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Restriction endonucleases (choice D) are site-specific endonucleases that recognize specific base sequences and cleave the nucleic acid backbone in the interior of the nucleic acid strand. Although restriction endonucleases are involved in transposon movement, they are not the means by which the drug resistances are acquired."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man with suspected lung cancer undergoes resection of a large cavitary lesion of the lung. Examination of the lesion shows that it contains a freely mobile, matted ball of material. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the wall of the lesion shows granulomatous disease, which confirms tuberculosis infection. Which of the following images best represents the microscopic findings from the material inside the cavitary lesion in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Image A",
      "B. Image B",
      "C. Image C",
      "D. Image D",
      "E. Image E"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has a fungus ball, or aspergilloma. These noninvasive or minimally locally invasive lesions are caused by Aspergillus species. They show saprophytic growth in preexisting lung cavities, which may be formed by tuberculosis, tumor, bronchiectasis, or other chronic lung infections. Patients are often asymptomatic but may become allergic to the fungus. Aspergillus fumigatus is a dematiaceous (dark-colored) fungus which forms hyphae that branch at acute angles. Choice A is an image of the arthroconidia of Coccidioides immitis. These are the infectious forms that are found in desert sand. Coccidioides causes San Joaquin Valley fever, which may be an acute or chronic pulmonary condition but is unlikely to invade cavitary lesions of the lung and cause fungus balls. Choice B is an image of the infectious form of Sporothrix schenckii that causes rose-gardener's disease. These are hyphae with sleeves of conidia that would be found in vegetative material in gardens worldwide. Sporothrix causes cutaneous or lymphocutaneous lesions associated with puncture wounds formed while gardening or handling plant material. Choice D is an image of germ tubes (pseudohyphae) formed by Candida albicans when it invades tissues. Candida is an opportunistic pathogen, but it does not cause fungus balls by invading cavitary lesions in the lung. Choice E is an image of the hyphae of the Zygomycophyta (Mucor, Rhizopus or Absidia) which cause rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and cancer patients."

    "question": "A novel infectious disease has become prevalent and increasingly widespread over the past 2 years. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have just isolated the cause of the illness, which is a virus. The virus looks like a brick-shaped complex. It consists of double-stranded, enveloped DNA, which replicates in the cytoplasm via a virion-associated transcriptase. This new virus would be most likely classified in which of the following families?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Hepadnavirus",
      "C. Herpesvirus",
      "D. Papillomavirus",
      "E. Parvovirus",
      "F. Poxvirus"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Examples of viruses in the Poxvirus family are variola, vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum. All DNA viruses are icosahedral, except for Poxviruses, which are described as brick-shaped complexes. Poxvirus DNA is enveloped. All DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the nucleus, except for Poxvirus, which replicates in the cytoplasm via a virion-associated transcriptase. All of the enzymes and factors necessary for viral replication are then made in the cytoplasm. Adenoviruses (choice A) like the other DNA viruses (except Poxvirus), are icosahedral and have double-stranded linear DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The DNA is not enveloped and there is no virion-associated polymerase. The main example of the Hepadnavirus (choice B) family is the hepatitis B virus. It is icosahedral and contains partially double-stranded circular DNA that is enveloped. Viruses carry a DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity to synthesize an RNA intermediate that is then used to make genomic DNA. Herpesviruses (choice C) consist of herpes simplex, varicella zoster, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus. These are icosahedral and contain enveloped double-stranded linear DNA. The DNA replicates in the nucleus and the virus is assembled in the nucleus. Papillomaviruses (choice D) are icosahedral and contain naked double-stranded circular DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The most important of the Parvoviruses (choice E) is parvovirus B19. It is icosahedral and is the only DNA virus that contains single-stranded DNA, which is naked and replicates in the nucleus."

    "question": "A 19-year-old man who is a summer camp counselor in Mississippi is brought to the emergency department because of a headache, vomiting, and confusion He has a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F) and appears disoriented to time and place Physical examination shows gait ataxia when walking and the patient complains of double vision. Over the next several hours, the patient's confusion progresses to stupor Examination of cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture shows 300 lymphocytes, glucose of 50 mg/dL, and total protein of 20 mg/dL. Blood glucose is 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the means of transmission of the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aerosol",
      "B. Arthropod",
      "C. Fecal-oral",
      "D. Parenteral",
      "E. Sexual"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has the signs and symptoms of a viral encephalitis. During the summer months, most types of viral encephalitis are transmitted by mosquitoes. Examples of arthropod-borne viruses include St. Louis virus, West Nile encephalitis virus (Flaviviridae), and Eastern equine, Western equine, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (Togaviridae). Herpes simplex encephalitis is actually the most common type of encephalitis in the United States, but it is transmitted by direct contact with infected tissues. If this had been a herpes simplex encephalitis, the lumbar puncture would have yielded a high opening pressure and multiple red blood cells would have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Aerosol (choice A) is the mechanism of transmission of most of the respiratory viruses. Fecal-oral transmission (choice C) is the most common means of infection with most gastroenteritis viruses. Most of these viruses are naked capsid viruses which are able to withstand passage through the acidity of the stomach. Parenteral transmission (choice D) is common among the enveloped viruses, which require direct transfusion or transplantation to cause disease. Sexual transmission (choice E) is common among the enveloped viruses, which are extremely fragile in the environment."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a chronic cough and low-grade fever. Examination of sputum shows numerous acid-fast bacteria. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 500/uL. A chest x-ray shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare",
      "B. Mycobacterium leprae",
      "C. Mycobacterium marinum",
      "D. Mycobacterium scrofulaceum",
      "E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Despite the stress placed on the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex in discussions about HIV-infected patients, “ordinary” tuberculosis, caused by M. tuberculosis is the most prevalent form of mycobacterial infection at this point. M. avium-intracellulare complex infections usually do not predominate until the CD4 cell count has fallen well below 100/uL. It is also important to maintain a particularly high index of suspicion in AIDS patients, in whom the chest x-ray may be initially normal, possibly due to an impaired immune response. Some of these cases may clinically (and pathologically) resemble a more conventional bacterial pneumonia, because the body substitutes a comparatively ineffective neutrophil response for the granulomatous response it has trouble mounting. M. avium-intracellulare (choice A) are unusual mycobacterial infections that are noted for causing pulmonary and disseminated infections in AIDS patients, but they are less prevalent than M. tuberculosis except when the CD4+ count is less than 60/uL. M. leprae (choice B) causes leprosy. It is not an infection that is associated with HIV infection in the United States. M. marinum (choice C) can cause fish-tank granuloma (an ulcerating granuloma on the hands of tropical fish enthusiasts) when it enters through cuts in the skin in people who maintain home fish tanks. M. scrofulaceum (choice D) is a scotochromogen (produces carotenoid pigments in the dark) that causes solitary cervical lymphadenopathy in children exposed to contaminated water sources."

    "question": "A photograph of a stomach obtained at autopsy of a 38-year-old man is shown. The patient most likely was infected with which of the following organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Campylobacter jejuni",
      "B. Clostridium perfringens",
      "C. Escherichia coli",
      "D. Helicobacter pylori",
      "E. Shigella dysenteriae"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The photograph shows a stomach with a perforated peptic ulcer. Perforation of a peptic ulcer is potentially fatal, because of either peritonitis with sepsis or sudden exsanguination (if the perforation damages one of the many arteries of the stomach). Peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, possibly gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma have been strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori colonization of the mucus layer covering the gastric mucosa. The most important pathogenic attribute of H. pylori is its production of urease, which neutralizes the acidic pH of the stomach and allows the organism to invade the mucosal surface. The urease-positive organisms can be remembered with the mnemonic PUNCH: Proteus, Ureaplasma, Nocardia, Cryptococcus, Helicobacter. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with the urease breath test. Campylobacter jejuni (choice A) is also a gram-negative curved rod but is not associated with the formation of gastric ulcers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, anaerobic rod that is associated with gangrene and a mild form of food poisoning. Escherichia coli (choice C) is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod associated with many forms of gastroenteritis but not with gastric ulcer formation. Shigella dysenteriae (choice E) is a gram-negative, lactose-negative rod associated with bloody diarrhea but not with gastric ulcers."

    "options": [
      "A. DNA",
      "B. Double-stranded RNA, segmented",
      "C. Negative-stranded RNA",
      "D. Positive-stranded RNA",
      "E. Segmented RNA"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Composite viruses are viruses that are created in laboratories by artificially combining components of different parental viruses. In this case, the genetic material is DNA because the molluscum contagiosum virus is a double-stranded DNA virus in the poxvirus family. Thus the progeny viruses will have a double-stranded DNA genome. Double-stranded RNA, segmented (choice B) would be the genome of reoviruses, and neither poxviruses nor poliovirus have this form of genome. Negative-stranded RNA viruses (choice C) is the genome of many viruses including rabies and orthomyxoviruses, but neither is present in this composite virus. Positive-stranded RNA viruses (choice D) is the genome of the polioviruses, but because the example uses only the poliovirus capsid, the poliovirus nucleic acid would not be present in target cells. Segmented RNA (choice E) is carried by Reoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Arenaviridae, but none of these genomes were included in this composite virus."

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 100 cells, which are mostly lymphocytes, glucose of 35 mg/dL, and protein of 75 mg/dL. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm this patient's diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. India ink",
      "B. Latex particle agglutination",
      "C. Molecular probe",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Tzanck smear"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has symptoms and signs of a fungal cerebrospinal infection. The most common cause of meningitis in AIDS patients in the United States is Cryptococcus neoformans, which is an encapsulated, monomorphic yeast acquired from exposure to pigeon droppings. Although the USMLE likes to mention the India ink test of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in vignettes to avoid having to give away the diagnosis, India ink is not the preferred diagnostic test. The more sensitive test that is used in most hospital situations is latex particle agglutination to detect capsular antigens shed into the CSF. India ink (choice A), a test to diagnose cryptococcal infections, depends on the precipitation of a particulate dye around the capsular material of the organism. It misses about 50% of all infections. Molecular probes (choice C) are used in many diagnoses, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a variety of virus infections. It is not used for cryptococcal meningitis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (choice D) is used to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in infants. This assay detects integrated HIV (provirus). PCRs are available for other virus infections but are not used to diagnose cryptococcosis. Tzanck smear (choice E) is used to diagnose herpesvirus infections. It involves touching a slide or coverslip to a lesion to lift off the multinucleated giant cells caused by the infection."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The stones described are pigment stones, composed of relatively pure calcium bilirubinate. These stones are less common than cholesterol stones. Risk factors for pigment stones include hepatic cirrhosis (unclear mechanism), hemolytic anemias, and liver fluke infection, notably by the Oriental liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Fasciolopsis buski (choice B) is a large intestinal fluke that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal mucosal abscesses. Fasciola spp., not Fasciolopsis, are other liver flukes besides Clonorchis. Paragonimus westermani (choice C) is a lung fluke that can cause cough, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis. Schistosoma haematobium (choice D) is a blood fluke that tends to infect pelvic veins and may cause bladder disease (including cancer).

      "D. Herpesvirus",
      "E. Parvovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses, of which only serotype B19 is pathogenic for humans. This virus causes three distinct syndromes: a childhood febrile rash known as erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), aplastic crisis in individuals with chronic hemolytic diseases (sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia, etc.), and congenital infections that can present as stillbirth, hydrops fetalis (analogous to severe Rh incompatibility), or severe anemia. Coxsackie viruses (choice A) usually cause coldlike illness, but can cause herpangina, myocarditis, and meningitis. Echoviruses (choice B) can infect a variety of organ systems (gastrointestinal, central nervous system, eyes, heart, respiratory, skin), but are not a cause of aplastic crises. Hepadnavirus (choice C) is the causative agent of hepatitis B.

    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Homologous recombination",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The diagram shows the process of conjugation between an F+ donor and an F- recipient bacterium. This process transfers plasmids in their entirety from the donor to the recipient. The traits that will be transferred in this way are those encoded in the plasmid and all recipients will become donors in the process. Generalized transduction (choice B) can be accomplished by both lytic and temperative phage only during the lytic cycle. The process involves the phage mistakenly packaging bacterial DNA into the capsid and transferring the DNA to another bacterial cell. In this type of transduction any gene can be transferred. Homologous recombination (choice C) is not a mechanism of genetic transfer for bacteria but a mechanism by which bacterial nucleic acid is stabilized following transfer. Transformation, transduction, and Hfr conjugation are all followed by homologous recombination requiring recombinase A. Specialized transduction (choice D) can only be accomplished by a temperate phage in which there is an excision error during induction of the phage from the bacterial chromosome. In this case, bacterial nucleic acid is mistakenly excised along with phage DNA. Only certain genes (located next to the phage insertion sites) have an opportunity to be transferred. Transformation (choice E) is the uptake of naked DNA by certain 'competent' bacterial cells."

Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath and worsening cough. An x-ray of the chest shows scattered interstitial opacities. Treatment with erythromycin is begun and her symptoms rapidly improve. Which of the following findings is most likely associated with the causal organism of patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cold agglutinins",
      "B. Dieterle silver staining",
      "C. Quellung reaction",
      "D. Requirement for cysteine",
      "E. Requirement for factors X and V"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient's clinical presentation is typical of primary atypical pneumonia. This type of pneumonia is typically caused by intracellular organisms such as viruses, or Chlamydiae, but since Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall, it does not elicit the characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate caused by most other bacteria. Because the patient's infection responded to erythromycin, it cannot have been caused by a virus; so the most likely causative agent is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A finding in about 65% of Mycoplasma patients is the production of cold agglutinins: IgM isohemagglutinins that will agglutinate autologous erythrocytes at 4°C (39.2°F). The Dieterle silver stain (choice B) is used to identify Legionella pneumophila, which is an agent of atypical pneumonia of the elderly but would be more likely in a smoker or immunosuppressed patient. Legionella would respond to erythromycin, but this patient is not immunocompromised. The Quellung reaction (choice C) is a technique used to identify the capsular serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium is the most common cause of adult typical pneumonia and would not cause the interstitial presentation described here. Requirement for cysteine (choice D) is a characteristic of four genera of bacteria: Francisella, Legionella, Brucella, and Pasteurella. Although Francisella, Legionella, and Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens that could cause atypical pneumonia, they would not be expected in this patient. Francisella is acquired from ticks or from handling infected reservoir animals. Brucella is acquired from contaminated dairy products or contact with animals. Legionella is a disease of elderly smokers who are immunosuppressed. Pasteurella is found in the mouths of many animals and is transmitted most commonly from cat bites. Requirement for factors X and V (choice E) is characteristic of Haemophilus. Haemophilus is an extracellular bacterium that causes otitis media, epiglottitis, pharyngitis and meningitis in unvaccinated children who are between 3 months and 2 years of age. It would not be expected in the present patient's age group."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. A variety of fungi can produce acute or chronic lung disease like that described in this case history. They are distinguished by geographic incidence and examination of the sputum or biopsy. Histoplasma capsulatum which causes histoplasmosis, is observed most frequently in the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri river valleys of the United States (Central U.S.). The organism is a small (2-to-5-μm) intracellular yeast which, despite the name, has no true capsule. Calcifying lesions forming in the lungs are very suggestive of fungal infection. Blastomyces dermatitidis could cause similar presentation in this area, but it would be found in the sputum as a broad-based budding yeast, and that option is not available within the choices. Choice B describes Cryptococcus which is the most common cause of fungal meningitis in immunosuppressed patients notably those with AIDS or hematopoietic disorders. Choice C describes Paracoccidioides which can cause pulmonary disease in patients from South and Central America.

      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has granulocytic ehrlichiosis, caused by Ehrlichia phagocytophila. This intracellular bacterium is transmitted by the Ixodes tick, which also transmits Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. The disease presents similarly to Rocky Mountain spotted fever but does not have a rash. The pathognomonic feature in this case history is the presence of morulae (berry-like clusters of organisms) inside the patient's granulocytes. Francisella tularensis (choice B) can be transmitted in a number of different ways, but when an arthropod is implicated, it is the Dermacentor tick. This is the same tick that transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Tularemia is an ulceroglandular disease with fever, ulcer at the bite site, and lymph node enlargement. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of most of the encephalitis viruses, all species of malaria parasites, dengue yellow fever, and filariasis. This patient clearly does not have encephalitis, and malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and filariasis would not be expected in a 16-year-old boy in the continental United States. Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) is the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and is transmitted by the Dermacentor tick. Rocky Mountain spotted fever has a characteristic rash that begins on the ankles and wrists progressing toward the trunk. The Weil-Felix test, which is a nonspecific test for antibodies that agglutinate Proteus organisms, would be positive. This tick also transmits Francisella tularensis but the symptoms of this patient are not consistent with either tularemia (an ulceroglandular disease) or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (choice E) is the agent of scrub typhus. It is transmitted by mites in the genus Leptotrombidium. Rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari) is also transmitted in this fashion, but both of these diseases are rare in the United States and would be characterized by rash and Weil-Felix test positivity."

      "F. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has acquired primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri. This organism is a free-living ameba that is found in warm freshwater lakes. During the act of diving into such lakes, changes in pressure can force the organism through the cribriform plate and result in the production of necrotic lesions spreading from the olfactory lobes. The form of the organism that is found in human tissue is a flagellated trophozoite. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. This is a common cause of meningitis in young adults, but the case history would have to describe the presence of petechial hemorrhages from endotoxin toxicity. N. meningitidis overproduces outer membrane fragments and thus produces very early signs of endotoxin shock compared to other gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive catalase-negative diplococci (choice B) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although this is the most common cause of typical pneumonia, meningitis and sinusitis in the United States, it is not associated with swimming or diving, and the CSF would have shown extremely high numbers of neutrophils, low glucose, and high protein. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice D) describes cells infected with herpes simplex virus. This is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. It is not associated with swimming or diving. Although the CSF cell, protein, and glucose values could have indicated a viral etiology, herpes simplex encephalitis is also associated with a high opening pressure and the presence of many red blood cells. Encephalitis is also generally associated with confusion or change in mental status. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles (choice E) describes the zygomycophyta: bread mold fungi in the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, and Mucor. These agents can cause fatal rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and adults with cancer. The symptoms would be quite similar to those described in this case history, but these are opportunistic pathogens that do not cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts (choice F) describes Cryptococcus neoformans. This monomorphic fungus is the principal cause of meningitis in patients with Hodgkin disease or AIDS."

    "question": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a sudden high fever, severe dyspnea, and malaise. One hour later, he develops progressive respiratory distress and supplemental oxygen is provided. He has a history of intravenous drug abuse, His CD4 cell count is 73/uL. Which of the following tests will be most helpful in confirming the identity of the most likely causal agent of his fever and respiratory symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. CD4 cell count",
      "B. Direct fluorescent antibody test",
      "C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Western blot"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The most common atypical pneumonia in AIDS is caused by the atypical fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii). Patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia have great difficulty producing sputum, so bronchial lavage or transmural biopsy are generally required. The sample is then submitted to the direct fluorescent antibody test or stained with Gomori methenamine silver stain to visualize the organisms. The direct fluorescent antibody test is a technique to demonstrate the presence of antigen from a pathogen in a patient. Antigen-detecting tests will remain useful throughout the life of an AIDS patient because they do not depend on detection of the patient's immune response to the pathogen (which may be absent at the end of AIDS). When stained with methenamine silver, Pneumocystis cysts have a characteristic cup or boat shape; the individual cells are difficult to demonstrate without electron microscopy. CD4 cell count (choice A) is used to measure the progression of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since the virus infects and destroys these cells, the number remaining in the circulation becomes a good predictor of the progression of disease. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (choice C) is used as the screening test to diagnose HIV infection. It is a serologic test (i.e., identifies antibodies against the virus) and once the patient progresses into full-blown AIDS, antibody levels other than IgM will decline, so in general, serologic tests in late HIV infection tend to be less useful than tests that detect antigens from a pathogen. Polymerase chain reaction (choice D) is used to detect the viral load of the HIV virus in infected patients and infants. Western blot (choice E) is the confirmatory serologic test that is used in the diagnosis of HIV infection."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman from Mexico develops an indurated, erythematous nodule that is 12 mm in diameter after receiving a PPD tuberculin test. Which of the following is the bacterial feature most important in stimulating this response?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cell wall",
      "B. Cytoplasmic membrane",
      "C. Flagella",
      "D. Outer surface protein",
      "E. Periplasmic space"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This woman has developed a positive tuberculin skin test indicating exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The molecule injected into the skin of the forearm to elicit this response is a purified protein derivative (PPD), which is composed of tuberculin (an outer surface protein) and mycolic acids of the organism. This is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction requiring sensitized TH1 cells. Only proteins can evoke such responses, since T cells are only capable of recognizing peptides presented to them in the context of an MHC molecule. The cell wall (choice A) of mycobacteria contains a thinner-than-normal layer of peptidoglycan and mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids. However, this material is not proteinaceous and therefore does not stimulate the TH1 cells necessary for the formation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The cytoplasmic membrane (choice B) of mycobacteria is a phospholipid bilayer that is similar to the inner membranes of all other prokaryotes and does not contribute to the specific skin test for tuberculosis. Flagella (choice C) are not present on M. tuberculosis because the organism is not motile. M. tuberculosis does not possess a periplasmic space (choice E) because it is an organism that is taxonomically related to the gram-positives. Only gram-negative bacteria possess a periplasmic space."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man develops hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, and cognitive deterioration. An MRI of the brain shows widespread areas of abnormal T2 signal in the white matter. An electroencephalogram shows diffuse slowing over both cerebral hemispheres. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the brain shows demyelination with abnormal giant oligodendrocytes, some of which contain eosinophilic inclusions. This patient's condition occurs most commonly in association with which of the following diseases?",
    "options": [
      "A. AIDS",
      "B. Chickenpox",
      "C. Measles",
      "D. Multiple sclerosis",
      "E. Rabies",
      "F. Syphilis",
      "G. Tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rapidly progressive demyelinating disorder in which the JC virus (a polyomavirus) infects oligodendroglial cells in the brain. The eosinophilic inclusions represent accumulations of JC virus. PML occurs in about 1% of AIDS patients, and is the AIDS-defining illness in half of the patients who develop the condition. Symptoms include aphasia, hemiparesis, cortical blindness, ataxia, and conjugate gaze abnormalities. The condition can progress to quadriparesis and coma. There is no effective treatment for this disorder. Shingles and postinfectious encephalitis can follow chickenpox (choice B) but varicella is not specifically associated with demyelination. Measles (choice C) can cause an encephalitis and, in some cases, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) may follow previous measles infection. These disorders would affect not only white matter but gray matter as well. Also, SSPE usually occurs before the age of 18. Multiple sclerosis (choice D) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease characterized by demyelination. The immunologic basis of the pathology appears to be that TH1 lymphocytes reactive against myelin stimulate macrophages to destroy the myelin. It is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity response. Women are affected twice as often as men. The disease tends to have a relapsing and remitting course and may involve visual impairment, cranial nerve signs, ataxia, nystagmus, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Spinal cord lesions give rise to motor and sensory difficulties of the trunk and limbs, and spasticity and loss of control of bladder function. Rabies (choice E) produces eosinophilic inclusions (Negri bodies) in the brain but these are found in the gray matter. Signs of rabies would include excessive salivation, hallucinations, and hydrophobia. Syphilis (choice F) can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord damage, but the disease process would not be limited to the white matter. Tuberculosis (choice G) can cause a granulomatous meningitis, typically affecting the base of the brain."

    "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of redness and a yellowish discharge from her left eye over the past 2 days. She has had minimal crusting upon awakening in the morning but has not had eye pain or previous trauma. Physical examination shows diffuse conjunctival hyperemia and a mucoid discharge. The pupils are reactive to light, but there is mild photophobia of the affected eye. Gram stain of the exudate shows pleomorphic, gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following is necessary to culture the most likely causal organism on a blood agar plate?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antibiotics to inhibit normal flora",
      "B. Cold temperature",
      "C. Egg-yolk cholesterol",
      "D. Reduced oxygen tension",
      "E. Staphylococcus aureus on blood agar"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The patient is suffering from conjunctivitis caused by Haemophilus, a fastidious organism requiring factors V (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and X (hematin), which must be released from whole-blood preparations to be accessible to the organism. This can be done by gentle heating, which lyses the red blood cells, or by co-culture with Staphylococcus aureus, which is beta-hemolytic and lyses the red blood cells to provide the factors Haemophilus needs for growth. This is called the satellite phenomenon. Antibiotics (choice A) would not be necessary since, with proper culture techniques, no normal flora should be available to confuse the diagnosis of conjunctivitis. Antibiotics and antifungals are added to chocolate agar to create Thayer-Martin medium to prevent the growth of normal flora when culturing from the genital tract. Cold temperature (choice B) would not be necessary because Haemophilus grows at normal body temperature. Listeria is the genus commonly mentioned for which a cold temperature is necessary. Cholesterol (choice C) is necessary for the growth of Mycoplasma but not Haemophilus. Low oxygen tension (choice D) is necessary for the growth of the microaerophiles (such as Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Borrelia), but is not a condition for growth of Haemophilus."

      "D. A silver-staining cyst",
      "E. A yeast that forms pseudohyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This woman has developed a pulmonary abscess, as evidenced by the chest radiograph. Of the organisms listed, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely cause of bacterial pneumonia complicated by abscess formation. Bacteria that commonly produce pneumonia that develops in the context of influenza include Staph. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of these, Staph. aureus is most destructive to lung tissue and likely to cause cavitary lesions. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus (choice A) describes Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium would be a cause of pneumonia in alcoholic or diabetic patients, or in those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A gram-positive catalase-negative alpha-hemolytic diplococcus (choice B) describes Strep. pneumoniae. This agent causes a necrotizing abscessing pneumonia with appearance similar to that of Staph. aureus, but it rarely causes cavitary lesions. A silver-staining cyst (choice D) describes Pneumocystis jiroveci. This agent is associated with atypical pneumonia in the immunocompromised or in premature infants. A yeast that forms pseudohyphae (choice E) describes Candida albicans. Candida is an opportunistic pathogen in the immunocompromised, but would not be expected to be associated with postviral pneumonia."

      "C. Orchitis",
      "D. Shingles",
      "E. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is varicella (chickenpox), which is the primary form of infection by the herpes zoster (varicella-zoster) virus. Recurrence due to virus harbored in neurons tends to be dermatomal in distribution and is called shingles. Fever, malaise, headache, and myalgia may also be present, particularly in the prodromal phase. Tzanck smear of the base of a vesicle may demonstrate multinucleated giant cells. Immunocompromised patients can be treated with acyclovir to prevent dissemination. Chickenpox may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, systemic spread (immunosuppressed patients), neurologic involvement (rare), Reye syndrome (rare), and/or hemolytic anemia (rare). Genital vesicles and ulcers (choice A) are associated with herpes simplex type 2. Infectious mononucleosis (choice B) is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Orchitis (choice C) can complicate mumps infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (choice E) is a rare complication of measles infection."

Two weeks later, he returns to the physician because of a generalized maculopapular rash. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chest x-ray",
      "B. ELISA",
      "C. Heterophile antibody test",
      "D. Lateral x-ray of the neck",
      "E. Rapid antigen test",
      "F. Varicella virus indirect immunofluorescence"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient most likely has infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The clinical features include sore throat, headache, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, hepatosplenomegaly, periorbital edema, rash, and a palatal enanthem. The diagnosis is made by heterophile antibody testing, EBV antibody titers, and lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. Treatment includes rest, fluids, and analgesics. Treatment with penicillin derivatives (ampicillin) leads to a maculopapular rash. Chest x-ray (choice A) is useful for a respiratory or cardiac process. Infectious mononucleosis cannot be diagnosed by any radiographic study. ELISA (choice B) would be a useful screening test for a variety of infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A lateral x-ray of the neck (choice D) is useful in acute epiglottitis; it would show epiglottic swelling. The symptoms of epiglottitis include extreme sore throat, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. A rapid antigen test (choice E) is used to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is characterized by fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A scarlatiniform rash may follow the pharyngitis. The rash, a diffuse erythema that later desquamates, is caused by an erythrotoxin. Antibodies to the varicella virus (choice F) can be detected by immunofluorescence. The symptoms of varicella include a vesicular rash (in various stages of evolution), fever, and malaise. The treatment is bathing soaks and antipruritic topical medication. Treatment with aspirin has been associated with Reye syndrome and should therefore be avoided."

      "B. Gram-positive anaerobic rod",
      "C. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus",
      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus",
      "E. Single-stranded diploid RNA virus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a multisystem syndrome caused by a toxin (TSST-1) formed by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. TSS usually affects several organ systems (gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary) and can result in death. TSS has historically been associated with the use of tampons in young women, but can also occur in other patient populations. Fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and diffuse rash with desquamation of the hands and feet are common symptoms. Management of shock, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a priority if these conditions are present, in addition to appropriate antibacterial treatment. S. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting, nonmotile, non-H₂S-producing bacillus (choice A) describes the genus Shigella, which causes dysentery, characterized by fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea. A gram-positive anaerobic rod (choice B) describes Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene with necrosis of soft tissues, usually after a traumatic wound. It is also a cause of food poisoning. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus (choice D) describes Staph. epidermidis, which is part of the normal skin flora but is notorious for causing infections of intravenous lines and prosthetic heart valves. A single-stranded diploid RNA virus (choice E) describes the retroviruses. Although HIV-1 can cause many diverse findings and should never be immediately ruled out, the findings in the present patient are most specific for TSS."

      "D. Plague",
      "E. Poliovirus",
      "F. Rabies",
      "G. Tularemia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, first reported in 1993, consists of fever, myalgia, and rapid development of respiratory failure leading to death. The initial cases were mostly among Navajo Indians, however, cases have been documented in many U.S. states and in Canada. It is most common in the U.S. Four Corners states: New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. The causative agent is a hantavirus belonging to the family Bunyaviridae. The virus has also been called the Sin Nombre (Spanish for 'without a name') virus. Infection is thought to be through inhalation of aerosolized secretions from the common deer mouse. The disease typically begins with a nonspecific prodrome (fever, generalized myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances) followed 4 to 5 days later by respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea). This progresses rapidly to an adult respiratory distress syndrome and, in many cases, death. California encephalitis (choice A) is caused by an arbovirus transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Most cases are in children younger than 10 years of age. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Myalgias and arthralgias are typically present. Seizure activity is most frequently observed in infants and young children. Most cases are in the midwestern United States. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (choice B) is a Herpesvirus that produces a variety of infections. Primary CMV infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients, but can cause a heterophile-negative mononucleosis syndrome. Perinatal infections can occur in utero, intrapartum, or postpartum, and can produce congenital malformations. CMV can be transmitted by leukocytes in blood transfusions. In patients with AIDS or other immunosuppressive states, CMV can produce severe disease, including retinitis, pneumonia, encephalitis, adrenalitis, and gastrointestinal tract ulcerations. Plague (choice D) is caused by Yersinia pestis. It is endemic in the desert southwest of the United States, but plague normally begins with an extremely high fever, conjunctivitis, and septicemia. If it is acquired by fleabite, then buboes (hemorrhagic lymph nodes) will be found; if it is acquired in the pneumonic form, then cough will be observed. Poliovirus (choice E) is a member of the Picornavirus family. It remains epidemic in parts of Asia and Africa even though the wild type has been eliminated from the western hemisphere. The virus affects cranial nerve nuclei and anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, producing a flaccid paralysis that is usually asymmetric. Vaccine-related polio can occur with the live virus vaccine. Rabies (choice F) is a Rhabdovirus that produces encephalitis and/or myelitis. It should be considered in persons who have recently traveled outside of the United States. The most common sources of exposure are dogs, cats, skunks, foxes, raccoons (in Florida and Connecticut), wolves, and bats. The infection is acquired from the bite of a rabid animal or by inhalation. Rabies also has been reported to occur in patients after corneal transplantation. The virus spreads along peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. Symptoms include hallucinations, hydrophobia and copious salivation. Tularemia (choice G) is caused by Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative, cysteine-requiring facultative intracellular bacillus. The disease is most common in Arkansas and Missouri, and is acquired by handling, ingesting, or inhaling material from infected reservoir animals such as deer, rabbits and small rodents. It may also be transmitted by ticks from one of the reservoir animals to humans. Tularemia is generally characterized by disseminated granulomatous lesions, and would not be expected to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The rare but life-threatening meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri apparently ensues when the organism enters the body through the nasal mucosa and crosses the cribriform plate to enter the brain via the olfactory nerves. It has been speculated that changes in pressure created during diving predispose to this infection. The cavernous sinus (choice A) is the site of entry of the zygomycophyta (Rhizopus, Mucor or Absidia) into the brain in diabetic ketoacidotic patients or adults with cancer. The lacrimal bone (choice C) of the medial aspect of the orbit does not appear to be involved in amebic infection. The mouth and its associated bones, including the mandible (choice D), do not appear to be routes of infection for this organism. The nasal bones (choice E) located on the superior surface of the nose, do not appear to be a route of infection for this organism. The zygomatic bone (choice F) which forms the cheekbone, does not appear to be a route of infection for this organism."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) along with hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM Ab), and the absence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), indicate the early stages of an acute infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). A dual infection of HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (choice B) is not plausible since the IgM anti-HAV serology is negative. Chronic HBV infection (choice C) is unlikely because the patient has HBc IgM Ab, which is characteristic of an acute infection rather than a chronic infection. Immunity to HBV (choice D) is not plausible due to the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM Ab and the lack of HBsAb.

This type of endocarditis is typically acquired by illicit intravenous drug use, which can introduce skin organisms into the venous system that then attack the tricuspid valve. Staph. aureus accounts for between 60 and 90% of cases of endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Damage to the tricuspid valve is common. The endocarditis associated with congenital heart disease (choice B) typically involves left-sided valves (mitral or aortic) and is more often subacute, caused by viridans streptococci."

    "options": [
      "A. IgG against BSA",

      "D. IgG and IgM against BSA",
      "E. IgM against BSA",
      "F. IgM against BSA and IgG against KLH"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Three weeks and three injections after the beginning of the experiment, the animals will have undergone a full primary immune response fo the BSA, along with isotype-switching of those antibodies from IgM to IgG. The response to KLH at 7 days after its first injection will be a primary immune response, with anti-KLH IgM predominating. IgM is always the first antibody produced in response to any antigen, and IgG is the most common secondary immune response antibody unless a mucosal surface is involved, in which case IgA might predominate in the secondary and all subsequent responses. IgG against BSA (choice A) will certainly be present in these animals due to the multiple repeated inoculations over a 3-week period, but the animals will also be making a primary immune response (IgM) to the first injection of KLH. IgG against BSA and KLH (choice C) is not correct, since 7 days after the first injection of KLH a primary immune response will just be beginning. It is not possible for the isotype switch of anti-KLH antibodies to have occurred at this time. However, IgG against BSA will be found. IgG and IgM against BSA (choice D) is a possible but incomplete answer. There should be low-level production of IgM against BSA in these animals. but since affinity maturation improves the binding strength of populations of antibodies during the burst of clonal proliferation and subsequent natural selection. it is unlikely that these antibodies will have high titers in the serum compared with those of the high-affinity IgG molecules. Furthermore, this answer does not acknowledge that a primary response against KLH would be happening in these animals at the same time. IgM against BSA (choice E) is not correct because after 3 weeks and three inoculations, the animals should have finished their primary immune response (IgM) and be well into their secondary response (IgG). IgM against BSA and IgG against KLH (choice F) is not correct and is the opposite of what would be expected. IgM is the primary immune response antibody and IgG is the secondary immune response antibody. BSA in these animals should be a secondary response (even a tertiary response) and KLH should be a primary response."

Clinically, the condition is classified as a selective T-cell deficiency, but varying degrees of deficiency of antibody production may also be seen. Affected infants are susceptible to fungal and viral infections, and may exhibit tetany due to severe hypocalcemia. Congenital rubella syndrome (choice A) is associated with patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, microcephaly. cataracts, and deafness. Cytomegalovirus in utero infection (choice B) is associated with hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytic purpura, and damage to the central nervous system and retina.

    "question": "A 60-year-old man with a history of alcoholism is brought to the emergency department after being found behind the neighborhood bar at 4 AM. in freezing weather. He is lethargic and has shaking chills. His temperature is 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse is 106/min, respirations are 12/min and labored, and blood pressure is 108/62 mm Hg.

His sputum is blood-tinged and contains numerous gram-positive, alpha-hemolytic cocci. Treatment with penicillin is begun and his condition improves over the next few days. Which of the following immune effector mechanisms is most important in completely clearing this infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity)",
      "B. Cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes",
      "C. LAK cells",
      "D. Natural Killer cells",
      "E. opsonization"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The patient has typical pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae - One of the most efficient mechanisms for eliminating extracellular pathogenic bacteria is by opsonization and phagocytosis by phagocytes. The IgG and IgM antibodies produced in response to the organism react with the capsular structure, stimulating the activation of the classical pathway of the complement system. This pathway produces large amounts of C3b that coat the organism, enhancing the speed and efficiency of phagocytosis. ADCC (antibody-dependent cell cytotoxic cells) (choice A) are cells that find altered self cells that have been coated with antibody, and kill them. NK cells do not destroy antibody-coated bacteria, only altered self cells that are coated with antibody. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (choice B) destroy host cells that have antigen epitopes presented in association with class | major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. An example would be a virus-epitope from a virus-infected cell presented by class | molecules on the surface of the cell. LAK cells (choice C) are natural killer (NK) cells that have been activated by IL-2. They are considered to be superactivated NK cells. NK cells kill altered self cells such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells. NK cells (choice D) are cells of the innate immune system that destroy virus-infected cells or tumor cells. This does not involve antibody and it does not involve extracellular pathogens."

    "question": "A 56-year-old woman is diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. Treatment is begun with an in vitro culture of peripheral leukocytes in the presence of TH1 cytokines, followed by reinfusion into the circulation. After 2 years of remission, the patient returns to the physician for a follow-up examination. A CT scan of the chest shows renewed tumor growth in both lungs. Treatment with the previous therapy is repeated. however, it has no effect on tumor size. Which of the following has most likely been lost from the surface of the tumor cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. CD3",
      "B. CD4",
      "C. CD8",
      "D. HLAA B. and C",
      "E. HLA DP, DQ, and DR"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Tumor-specific killer cells could describe either cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or natural killer (NK) cells. Of the two, only the CTLs would lose their activity if a surface molecule was lost, namely major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class | antigens. NK cells would actually be stimulated by the loss of MHC class |, so they could not be the cells to which the question refers. Tumor antigens may be present in the groove of the class | MHC molecule of transformed cells. These are presented to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which recognize the MHC class I/peptide complex on the cell surface and kill the tumor cell. Loss of this molecule would therefore prevent the tumor cell from being killed. The MHC class | molecule is described as a two-chain structure, with one of the chains (beta-2 microglobulin) holding the other chain (alpha chain) in its needed configuration on the cell surface. In the human, class | MHC molecules are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. The T-cell signal transduction molecule, or CD3 (choice A) is a marker on all T cells. It is not involved in antigen recognition. This molecule would not be on the surface of tumor cells unless the malignant cells themselves were T lymphocytes. The co-receptor for MHC class II molecules, or CD4 (choice B) , would not be on the surface of this tumor cell. but it would be on the surface of a helper T lymphocyte. The co-receptor for MHC class | molecules, or CD8 (choice C) would not be on the surface of this tumor cell, but it would be on the surface of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte. HLA DP, DQ, and DR are the MHC class II molecules in humans (choice E). These are not involved in killing of tumor cell targets. They present peptide fragments (derived from intracellular killing of extracellular organisms by macrophages) to CD4+ (helper) T lymphocytes."

Which of the following cell surface markers should be used to identify the B cells in this blood sample?",
    "options": ["A. CD3", "B. CD4", "C. CD8", "D. CD19", "E. CD56", "F. IgM"],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The best markers for identification of B cells are CD19, CD20, and CD21. The CD21 molecule is a receptor for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The CD3 marker (choice A) is present on all T cells. This is the marker that is used to identify total T cell count in a blood sample. CD3 is the signal transduction molecule on T cells. The CD4 marker (choice B) is used to identify T-helper (TH) cells. These are the cells that recognize exogenous peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules by macrophages. CD4+ TH cells are also involved in cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity, production of cytokines for stimulation of antibody production by B cells, and stimulation of macrophages. The CD8 marker (choice C) is used to identify cytotoxic T cells. These are the cells that recognize viral epitopes attached to the MHC class | molecules of a virus-infected cell. The CD56 marker (choice E) is used to identify natural Killer (NK) cells. These cells are important in innate host defense, specializing in killing virus-infected cells and tumor cells by secreting granzymes and perforins. IgM (choice F) is present on mature naive B lymphocytes along with IgD, but would not be present on any memory cells. Therefore, to receive an idea of the proportion of all immunoglobulin-bearing cells in the circulation, IgM determination would not be the best choice."

He says that he has experienced this numerous times in the past. One year later, he participates in a clinical immunologic study. A flow cytometric measurement of T cells shows values within the normal range. An increased serum concentration of which of the following cytokines is most likely to decrease the likelihood of a contact dermatitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gamma interferon",
      "B. IL-2",
      "C. IL-5",
      "D. IL-8",
      "E. IL-10"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. IL-10 is produced by T-helper 2 (TH2) cells and inhibits T-helper 1 (TH1) cells. Since the cytokines from TH1 cells stimulate cell-mediated immunity and delayed hypersensitivity, an increased level of IL-10 would decrease the likelihood of contact dermatitis, which is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Other cytokines from TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce antibody. Gamma-interferon (choice A) from TH1 cells inhibits TH2 cells. It also activates natural killer (NK) cells and activates macrophages. This cytokine would make a contact dermatitis worse, not better. IL-2 (choice B) stimulates the TH1 subset, CD8 T cytotoxic cells, and activates NK cells. It causes cloning of the cells of cell-mediated immunity, and thus would make a contact dermatitis worse. IL-5 (choice C) is secreted by TH2 cells and promotes B-cell proliferation, IgA synthesis in the submucosa, and eosinophil production in the bone marrow. It does not have a direct effect on TH1 function. IL-8 (choice D) is produced by macrophages and is chemotactic for neutrophils. This cytokine is most important in stimulating an inflammatory reaction and in attraction of neutrophils to the site."

      "C. Hypochlorite",
      "D. Myeloperoxidase",
      "E. NADPH oxidase"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This child has chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is a genetic defect in one or more of the subunits of NADPH oxidase. Activation of this membrane-bound oxidase is the critical first step in the generation of toxic oxygen radicals within the phagolysosome. One of the products of this reaction, hydrogen peroxide, serves as the substrate for the second most important killing mechanism: myeloperoxidase acting to produce toxic halide radicals. Patients with CGD are prone to persistent infections with catalase-positive bacteria and fungi, because these organisms destroy the hydrogen peroxide that they produce metabolically, so neither of the oxygen-dependent mechanisms can function in intracellular killing during these infections. Defensins (choice A) are part of the oxygen-independent mechanisms of phagocytic killing. These make up the largest number of different antimicrobial mechanisms used by phagocytes, but there are no known disease states that result from such deficiencies. Hydrogen peroxide (choice B) is the substrate for the myeloperoxidase enzyme system. It is produced inside the cell by the activation of NADPH oxidase, but it is also produced by aerobic microorganisms as a byproduct of their metabolism. Hypochlorite (choice C) is a toxic product arising in the myeloperoxidase arm of the intracellular killing pathway when myeloperoxidase acts on hydrogen peroxide to produce toxic halide radicals. Myeloperoxidase (choice D) is an enzyme present in neutrophils that acts on hydrogen peroxide to produce toxic halide radicals such as hypochlorite."

      "C. Antibodies to SS-A ribonucleoprotein",
      "D. complement-mediated lysis of blood vessels in the face",
      "E. Epstein-Barr virus infection"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype connective-tissue disease. The diagnosis requires that four out of 11 possible criteria be met: malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis, serositis, renal disorder, neurologic disorder, hematologic disorder, immunologic disorder, and antinuclear antibody (ANA). This patient also has anti-Sm, which is pathognomonic for SLE but is found in only 30% of the affected patients. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) are present in 95 to 100% of SLE cases; anti-double stranded DNA is found in 70% of cases. The vasculitis and rash of SLE are associated with immune complex deposition in the small-diameter blood vessels, followed by complement-mediated lysis. Antibodies to centromeres (choice A) are found in 90% of patients with limited scleroderma or CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud syndrome, esophageal dysmotility, scleroderma, telangiectasias). They would be found in less than 5% of patients with SLE. Antibodies to the glomerular basement membrane (choice B) are found in Goodpasture syndrome. This causes the linear disposition of immunoglobulin, and often C3, along the glomerular basement membrane. It results in glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and occasionally idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. Antibodies to SS-A ribonucleoproteins (choice C) are found in Sjogren syndrome, which is characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. The secondary form of this disease may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, polymyositis, scleroderma vasculitis, mixed connective tissue disease, or thyroiditis. Antibodies to core proteins of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (Smith antigen) are found in 20 to 30% of SLE patients, and antibodies against SS-A ribonucleoproteins are found in 30 to 50% of patients with SLE. Epstein-Barr virus infection (choice E) has been suggested as being linked to the development of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This condition, which is of unknown etiology, involves severe mental and physical exhaustion that is not relieved by rest and may be worsened by even trivial exertion. The symptoms must be present for at least 6 months and must be idiopathic. Other signs that are not included in all diagnostic criteria may be found, including muscle weakness, cognitive dysfunction, hypersensitivity, orthostatic intolerance, digestive disturbances, depression, poor immune response, and cardiac and respiratory problems."

An MRI of the brain is shown. An increased concentration of which the following is most likely to be important in the pathogenesis of the lesions shown in the MRI?",
    "options": [
      "A. Immunoglobulin G",
      "B. Immunoglobulin M",
      "C. Interferon-gamma",
      "D. Interleukin-10",
      "E. Transforming growth factor-beta"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The symptoms and MRI shown are typical of multiple sclerosis, which is a demyelinating disease of autoimmune pathology. Multiple sclerosis is characterized microscopically by plaques with a central loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin but with relative preservation of axons. The plagues are surrounded by a peripheral rim of lymphocytes and increased astrocytes. The disease appears to be initiated by CD4+ TH1 lymphocytes that react against self myelin antigens and secrete cytokines such as interferon-gamma to activate macrophages. The activated macrophages are responsible for the demyelination. The disease is therefore classified as an example of a type IV hypersensitivity disease. Immunoglobulin G (choice A) may be present near multiple sclerosis plagues but its role in demyelination is unclear. IgG may be involved in type II and type III hypersensitivities, where antibodies bind to either fixed (type II) or circulating (type III) antigens to activate complement and start inflammation. In myasthenia gravis, for example, antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor in the neuromuscular junction cause abnormal function of the motor end plate and eventual inflammatory destruction of the area. Immunoglobulin M (choice B) could be found near multiple sclerosis plagues but it is not believed to play a role in the disease. IgM production is a cause of some type III hypersensitivities, such as rheumatoid arthritis, where circulating complexes of IgM against one’s own IgG (rheumatoid factor) begin to block the small-diameter blood vessels and activate complement, ultimately resulting in inflammatory damage. Interleukin-10 (choice D) is a product of TH2 lymphocytes that inhibits the cell-mediated immune response. It is unlikely to be produced near the location of an active TH1 response such as a multiple sclerosis plague. Interleukin-10 could be produced in type II or type III hypersensitivities when antibody production is stimulated, but is not likely to be produced in a type IV hypersensitivity, which is due to activation of TH1 cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (choice E) is a product of TH2 cells that encourages B-cell isotype-switching, and is not likely to be produced near the plagues of multiple sclerosis. This cytokine could potentially be produced in cases of hypersensitivities involving antibodies (types I, II, and III) but would not be present in cell-mediated hypersensitivities such as this one."

    "options": [
      "A. Infected APCs have viral peptides in class | MHC molecules",
      "B. Infected APCs have viral peptides in class || MHC molecules",
      "C. Normal APCs have normal peptides in class || MHC molecules",
      "D. Normal APCs have viral peptides in class | MHC molecules",
      "E. Normal APCs have viral peptides in class || MHC molecules"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ cells) recognize the target they intend to kill by binding their T-cell receptor to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class | molecule of the target cell. Cells infected with intracellular pathogens will have peptides in the groove of MHC class | on their surface, reflecting the fact that abnormal proteins are being produced internally. If an antigen-presenting cell (APC) has ingested a cell that has died of virus infection, the viral peptides will be presented in the context of the class II MHC molecule, and this will serve as the stimulatory signal for T-helper (TH) cells to begin producing stimulatory cytokines. Thus, APCs will bear viral peptides in the context of class II MHC, whereas the infected target cell can be identified by finding viral peptides in the groove of the class | MHC. If there were not separate mechanisms for MHC molecules involved in cell-cell cooperation versus cytotoxic killing, CD8+ cells would kill the APCs necessary for 'turning on' the TH response. Infected APCs having viral peptides in class II MHC molecules (choice B) is not correct. If APCs were both infected and acting as antigen presenters, they could have viral peptides in the context of both classes of MHC molecules, but the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) identifies its target via class I/peptide combinations. Normal APCs having normal peptides in class II MHC molecules (choice C) is not correct. Uninfected APCs will have the groove of class II MHC molecules loaded with peptides from materials they have digested previously. Materials presented in the class II groove are not targets for cytotoxic killing by T cells. Normal APCs having viral peptides in class | MHC molecules (choice D) is not correct. Only infected APCs will have viral peptides in the class | MHC groove. Normal APCs having viral peptides in class II MHC molecules (choice E) is true, but this will not serve as the signal for CTL targeting. Any uninfected APC that has digested a virus-infected cell may express viral peptides in the class II molecule, but this serves as the stimulus for TH cells, not CTLs, to become activated."

      "B. Eosinophil chemotactic factor-A",
      "C. Histamine",
      "D. Interleukin-4",
      "E. Interleukin-8"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child is suffering from the results of mast cell degranulation in response to histamine. Histamine, heparin, and eosinophil-chemotactic factor-A are found in preformed mast cell granules. These granules are released in response to physical injury, heat, cold, type | hypersensitivity reactions, C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins, proteins released from leukocytes, substance P, and melitin found in bee venom. In the present case, the direct degranulation of mast cells by melitin and subsequent release of histamine is the most direct cause of the boy's symptoms. Histamine is the principal mediator of the immediate transient phase of increased permeability of venules in acute inflammation, an effect mediated by H1 histamine receptors. Anaphylatoxins (choice A), another name for the complement components C3a and C5a, are substances produced in areas of acute inflammation that cause mast cell degranulation. Although they would contribute to these symptoms, they are not likely to be the most direct cause in the present case. Eosinophil chemotactic factor-A (choice B) is actually multiple substances that are preformed in mast cells and would be released in the area of this bee sting. They are not the most direct cause of this boy's symptoms. The attraction of eosinophils into areas of mast cell degranulation is important in cases in which the pathogen is a helminth, since eosinophils contain major basic protein, which is damaging to the cuticles of most helminths. Interleukin (IL)-4 (choice D) is produced by TH2 cells and is involved in causing isotype-switching in B lymphocytes to the production of IgE. Although IgE is an important cause of mast cell degranulation in type | hypersensitivities, it would be produced in the sensitization phase of a type | hypersensitivity, not in the actual symptomatic phase. IL-8 (choice E) is a product of macrophages and can cause mast cell degranulation, but it is not likely to be the most direct cause in this case."

Which of the following immunoglobulin markers is likely to be most useful in this paternity case?",
    "options": ["A. Allotype", "B. Idiotype", "C. Isotype", "D. Subisotype"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Allotypes are genetically inherited markers (amino acid sequence differences) that occur within the constant domains of both heavy and light chains of immunoglobulin molecules. They reflect the paternity of the individual, and are similar in concept to the ABO blood group alloantigens: they do not affect the function of the cell that bears them, but simply reflect patterns of inheritance. These are distinctive markers that, when present, can be helpful in paternity cases. If this man had these markers and the child had the same markers, then this would be presumptive evidence that the man is the child's biologic father. Other genetic tests would also performed in this case, because if the mother and father happened to have the same markers, then the findings could be nonconclusive. Idiotypes (choice B) are the antigen-recognition portions of the immunoglobulin molecule that are unique for specific antigens to which we have been exposed. Since every antibody molecule has a different idiotype (antigenic specificity) unless it has been made by a clone of cells, these would not be useful in determining paternity. The isotypes (choice C) are the five major classes of immunoglobulin: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. They are distinct from one another based on amino acid sequences in the constant domains of both heavy and light chains. Isotypes would not be helpful for a paternity case. Subisotypes (choice D) are subclasses within the isotypes of antibodies. IgG has four subisotypes and IgA has two subisotypes. They are distinguished on the basis of amino acid sequences in the constant domains of heavy chains and would not be useful in determining paternity."

    "options": ["A. CD3", "B. CD4", "C. CD8", "D. CD14", "E. CD20", "F. CD56"],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The disease in question is leprosy, or Hansen disease. Mycobacterium leprae has a predilection for the skin and cutaneous nerves, thereby producing the symptoms of depigmentation and anesthetic cutaneous lesions. This loss of peripheral nerve function leads to many of the disfiguring features of the disease: because the patients do not have normal pain sensation, they sustain repeated injuries. In addition, the organism attacks cartilage and causes granuloma formation in the skin, leading to some of the facial damage. The multinucleated giant cells that form in leprosy are modified macrophages or epithelioid cells. They possess CD14, the endotoxin receptor on their cell surface as well as CD16, the Fc receptor for the Fc tail of immunoglobulin G. CD3 (choice A) is the signal transduction complex molecule in T lymphocytes. Although T cells would be found in the granulomatous lesions of tuberculoid leprosy, these are not the cells that become multinucleated giant cells in these areas. CD4 (choice B) is the specific marker on the surface of T-helper lymphocytes. It would not be found on the multinucleated giant cells found in leprosy. CD8 (choice C) is the specific marker on the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These are not the cells that fuse together in the lesions of leprosy. CD20 (choice E) is part of the signal transduction complex in B lymphocytes. It would not be found on the surface of modified macrophages. CD56 (choice F) is one of two markers used to identify natural killer (NK) cells in tissues. The other marker on NK cells is CD16, the Fc receptor, by which NK cells carry out antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cells do not fuse together to form multinucleated giant cells in leprosy."

      "D. Plasma cells",
      "E. Suppressor T cells"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. CD4 and CD8 are both markers for T cells, and mature T cells express one or the other but not both. However, some of the immature T cells in the thymus (which can 'leak' into the baby's blood in small numbers) coexpress these markers before the cells have 'committed' to being either helper T (TH) or cytotoxic T cells. In adults, significant numbers of cells coexpressing CD4 and CD8 usually implies the existence of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a cell population similar to immature T cells. Normally, T-cell precursors entering the thymus are double-positive for CD4 and CD8. During thymic selection, cells that recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II become CD4-positive only and differentiate into TH lymphocytes, whereas cells that recognize MHC class | become CD8-positive only and differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Helper T cells (choice A) are CD4+ and CD8-. Suppressor T cells (choice E) are CD4- and CD8+. Immature B cells (choice B) and plasma cells (choice D) are both CD4- and CD8-, since these are T-cell markers."

      "D. Production of HOCI",
      "E. Transfer of lysosomal enzymes to phagosomes"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Phagocytosis is followed by rapid activation of oxygen-dependent enzymatic reactions referred to as the oxidative burst, which leads to generation of reactive oxygen radicals capable of killing bacteria. NADPH oxidase plays a fundamental role in the oxidative burst. NADPH oxidase is a multiprotein complex that oxidizes NADPH, producing superoxide anions (·O2−) from molecular oxygen. Superoxide anions then convert to H2O2 by spontaneous dismutation. Hydrogen peroxide serves as the substrate for myeloperoxidase, which then acts to produce toxic halide radicals. This child has chronic granulomatous disease, a group of congenital disorders characterized by defective bacterial killing and chronic predisposition to infections with catalase-positive microbes. Patients with CGD are prone to persistent infections with catalase-positive bacteria and fungi, because these organisms destroy the hydrogen peroxide that they produce metabolically, so neither of the oxygen-dependent mechanisms can function in intracellular killing during these infections. Other conditions due to defective leukocyte functions include genetic deficiencies in leukocyte adhesion molecules (leukocyte adhesion deficiencies 1 and 2; LAD1 and LAD2), which impair leukocyte adhesion and transmigration (choice A), leading to recurrent infections and defective wound healing. LAD1 is due to genetic alterations in the beta chain of the integrin. LAD2 is due to absence of sialyl-Lewis X, a carbohydrate that binds selectins expressed on activated endothelium. Chemotaxis (choice B) is impaired in a number of acquired conditions, including diabetes mellitus, malignancy, thermal injury, and sepsis. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency is a genetic condition characterized by absence of MPO and deficient production of HOCI (choice D). Myeloperoxidase converts H2O2 to HOCI in the presence of Cl−. HOCI is one of the most powerful bactericidal agents, killing bacteria by halogenation and oxidation of macromolecules. Patients with MPO deficiency tend not to be symptomatic unless they have a simultaneous inability to generate NADPH oxidase. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a deficiency in the transfer of lysosomal enzymes into phagosomes (choice E). This defect also affects melanocytes, nerve cells, and platelets, resulting in a peculiar constellation of clinical features, i.e., susceptibility to infections, albinism, nerve deficits, and a bleeding diathesis."

    "question": "A 56-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious on the street. One hour after arrival, he dies despite appropriate lifesaving measures. An autopsy shows small, scattered nodules within the apex of the right lung. Histologic examination shows these nodules to be composed of collections of large epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, surrounded by lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Caseating necrosis is seen in some of these lesions. and acid-fast bacilli are seen with appropriate staining. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the development of epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Interferon-gamma",
      "B. Interleukin-1",
      "C. Interleukin-2",
      "D. Nitric oxide",
      "E. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The patient had tuberculosis, and the lesions described here are granulomas, more specifically, they are caseating granulomas due to mycobacterial infection. Granulomatous inflammation is a specialized, immune-mediated form of chronic inflammation resulting from complex interactions between the cells involved in cell-mediated immunity, including TH1 lymphocytes and macrophages. The ultimate effect is the development of activated macrophages, which acquire an epithelial-like appearance (epithelioid macrophages) and may fuse to form multinucleated giant cells. This process begins with the uptake of foreign antigens by macrophages, which process and present them to helper T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes activate macrophages through interferon (IFN)-gamma and they become epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells. Epithelioid macrophages secrete interleukin-1 (choice B) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (choice E), which increase leukocyte recruitment locally and mediate the systemic acute-phase responses (e.g., fever, malaise). Macrophages release a large number of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for tissue damage, necrosis of parenchymal cells, and subsequent reparative fibrosis. However, the question asks which mediator causes the production of epithelioid macrophages, not which cytokines epithelioid macrophages produce. Interleukin-2 (choice C) is a product of TH cells, which stimulate cell proliferation. Macrophages are end-cells that are incapable of proliferation, thus they would not be affected by IL-2 production. Macrophages also produce nitric oxide (NO) (choice D), which plays an important role in microbial killing but may also result in tissue damage through generation of NO-related free radicals. Again, the question asks which mediator causes the production of epithelioid macrophages, not which products epithelioid macrophages produce."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man is found to be HIV-positive after a sexual encounter with a prostitute. He states that he did not have any symptoms during the period immediately after the encounter. During the asymptomatic phase of this infection, the virus is found in association with which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. B lymphocytes",
      "B. Follicular dendritic cells",
      "C. Ganglion cells",
      "D. Oligodendrocytes",
      "E. Peripheral nerves"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of lymph nodes are important reservoirs of HIV. Although some follicular dendritic cells are infected with HIV, most viral particles are found on the surface of their dendritic processes. Follicular dendritic cells have receptors to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins that serve to trap HIV virions coated with anti-HIV antibodies. These coated HIV particles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes (choice A) have a surface marker (CD21 protein, a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind. The virus associates with the host DNA, producing a latent infection. These cells may undergo polyclonal activation and proliferation, resulting in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 primarily affects the mouth and lips, causing 'cold sores'. It resides in the trigeminal ganglion and remains latent until reactivated. HSV type 2 primarily infects the genitals. Both types can infect the ganglion cells (choice C) in the CNS, causing a fatal encephalitis. Oligodendrocytes (choice D) are centrally affected by two viruses: JC virus (a polyomavirus) and measles virus. JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Measles virus produces a persistent, nonproductive infection of the CNS, leading to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Peripheral nerves (choice E) are affected by HIV virus in the AIDS-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy. This disease is characterized by subacute onset of proximal muscle weakness, sometimes with pain, and elevated levels of creatine kinase. The muscles and nerves are infiltrated with mononuclear cells, including HIV-positive macrophages."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of a pruritic, linear, vesicular rash on her leg. The rash developed 2 days after she returned from a hiking trip. She says that it began as a swollen. erythematous streak that developed into extremely itchy blisters and that she has experienced similar episodes in the past. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the development of this rash in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antigen-antibody complexes formed in the circulation and deposited in the tissue",
      "B. Cytotoxic antibodies against cell surface antigens",
      "C. IgE antibody-mediated basophil degranulation",
      "D. Release of histamine from mast cells",
      "E. Release of interferon-gamma from activated TH1 cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This woman most likely has been exposed to poison ivy, which caused a contact, type IV cell-mediated sensitivity response to urishiol, an oil found in poison ivy. Contact with this oil leads to a reaction that appears as a linear, streak-like rash in sensitized individuals. Redness, swelling, and pruritic blisters occur at the sites of contact. Sensitivity usually develops after the first contact with poison ivy, and the reaction described typically occurs after subsequent exposures. Antigenic activation of TH1 lymphocytes causes the production of interferon-gamma, which stimulates macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes to destroy the oil-coated cells. This reaction does not require the formation of antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes formed in the circulation and deposited in the tissue (choice A) underlie type III hypersensitivity reactions. Diseases mediated by this type of hypersensitivity include systemic lupus erythematosus and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Cytotoxic antibodies against cell surface antigens (choice B) produce type II hypersensitivity reactions. Diseases mediated by this type of hypersensitivity include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pemphigoid, pemphigus, and Goodpasture disease. IgE antibody-mediated basophil degranulation (choice C) and the release of histamine from mast cells (choice D) are the mechanisms responsible for type | immediate hypersensitivity reactions. IgE antibodies are formed in response to exposure to a specific antigen. Re-exposure to that antigen results in the cross-linking of the IgE molecules on the surface of mast cells and basophils, and subsequent degranulation to release mediators that cause the classic manifestations of type | hypersensitivity reactions. Examples are hives, hay fever, and anaphylactic reactions."

Laboratory studies show total immunoglobulin levels greater than 900 mg/dL and decreased C3 levels. To which of the following does this patient have an increased susceptibility?",
    "options": [
      "A. Human immunodeficiency virus-1",
      "B. Measles virus",
      "C. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare",
      "D. Type lll hypersensitivity",
      "E. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Individuals with C3 deficiency have an increased susceptibility to immune complex diseases (type III hypersensitivity). The most important functions of C3 are removing immune complexes from the bloodstream and enhancing opsonization. Type III hypersensitivity reactions result from immune complexes of self or foreign antigens bound to an antibody; these will activate complement, leading to tissue damage. Examples of type III hypersensitivity reactions include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (choice A), which is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an intracellular pathogen that depends on the activation of TH1 cells and their cytokines for a protective immune response. A patient with C3 deficiency would not be expected to be any more susceptible to an intracellular pathogen such as this one than the population at large would be. Measles (choice B) is caused by rubeola virus, which is an intracellular pathogen and would not be affected by deficiencies in complement. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (choice C) is an intracellular bacterium that infects phagocytic cells. It is controlled by a cell-mediated response, not a complement-mediated response. Type IV hypersensitivity (choice E) is a disease that depends on the action of TH1 cells, macrophages, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It does not depend on the presence of antibody and complement."

The cytokines IL-1 and TNF (choice B) are products of activated macrophages and endothelial cells, among others. They have multiple, often similar actions, including stimulation of production of many acute-phase reactants, stimulations of fibroblasts, and stimulation of endothelial expression of adhesion molecules.

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. A wide variety of defects related to complement can occur and can produce immunodeficiency. The pattern of recurrent Neisseria (gram-negative diplococcus) infections described here is typical of deficiency of complement factors C6, C7, or C8. Other complement deficiencies produce the following patterns: Deficiency of C1q produces a combined immunodeficiency with a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome. Deficiency of C1rs, C1s, C4, or C2 produces an SLE-like syndrome and glomerulonephritis. Deficiencies of C3 or C3b produce a tendency to pyogenic infections. No disease has yet been associated with C9 deficiency. B-cell deficiencies (choice A) occur in a number of conditions and tend, in general, to be associated with an increased susceptibility to extracellular organisms. Eosinophil deficiency (choice C) is not a usual cause of immunodeficiency, but it would impair the normal protective response against parasites.

      "E. T-helper 1 cells",
      "F. T-helper 2 cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This man, immunosuppressed to prevent rejection of his transplanted heart, has developed cerebral toxoplasmosis as evidenced by the multiple ring-enhancing lesions seen on MRI. This is a common occurrence in the immunocompromised, since Toxoplasma gondii is so common worldwide. It is estimated that up to 70% of the population of the United States is seropositive, so reactivation of cysts held in latency by a normal immune response becomes commonplace as the immune response declines. Toxoplasma is an intracellular protozoan parasite in the human. Cats act as the definitive host of the parasite and shed infectious forms in their feces. Intracellular pathogens are best controlled by cell-mediated immune responses. These responses are orchestrated by T helper-1 (TH1) cells. The effector mechanisms include cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages and cells capable of mounting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Complement (choice A) is a set of serum proteins that act to opsonize or lyse microbes in a cascading fashion to culminate in the production of a membrane attack complex that will lyse whatever particle has started the cascade. Complement acts primarily against extracellular agents, as it is not active against intracellular microbes. Immunoglobulin A (choice B) is the immunoglobulin found on the mucosal surfaces. Although Toxoplasma organisms are ingested across a mucosal surface, within the human, they exist as intracellular cysts. Intracellular organisms are not affected by the presence of IgA. IgE (choice C) is an immunoglobulin that can mediate ADCC against parasites, but it is elicited against helminth parasites and not intracellular protozoa such as Toxoplasma. IgG (choice D) is the most abundant antibody in the serum, but antibodies do not play a role in protection against intracellular organisms. TH2 cells (choice F) are important in humoral immunity, but do not usually play important roles against intracellular pathogens."

    "options": [
      "A. Defective chemotactic response",
      "B. Defective NADPH oxidase",
      "C. Deficiency of C5",
      "D. IgA deficiency",
      "E. Thymic hypoplasia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. A history of recurrent infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus sp. suggests a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is caused by a deficiency of NADPH oxidase inside phagocytic cells. In the absence of NADPH oxidase, phagocytes cannot generate toxic oxygen metabolites in the phagolysosome, and patients become susceptible to catalase-positive infections, particularly those caused by S aureus, Aspergillus sp., Nocardia, Salmonella, and Candida. The reason these patients have difficulties with catalase-positive microbes is that catalase production will destroy any hydrogen peroxide created during the metabolism of aerobic bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide is the substrate for myeloperoxidase (the second oxygen-dependent intracellular killing mechanism). Catalase-mediated destruction of hydrogen peroxide in a CGD patient will therefore eliminate the function of both oxygen-dependent mechanisms. In about 2/3 of patients the inheritance is X-linked and so the disease usually affects males, but the remainder of cases are autosomal recessive and can occur in females. Defective chemotactic responses (choice A) are seen in diseases such as alcoholism and diabetes mellitus. Defective chemotaxis would lead to increased susceptibility to a broad range of pathogens, and not just the catalase-positive ones listed in this case. Deficiency of C5 (choice C), a complement component, would make patients prone to infection by gram-negative bacteria, especially Neisseria species. IgA deficiency (choice D) represents the most common primary immunodeficiency and would present with an increased predisposition to autoimmune diseases, infections, and atopy. Thymic hypoplasia (choice E) is caused by defective development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, leading to decreased T-cell levels and making patients more prone to viral and fungal infections. Patients may also exhibit hypocalcemia and other signs of parathyroid insufficiency."

    "options": [
      "A. Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and causing death of the cells or tissues",
      "B. Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and changing the function of the tissue",
      "C. IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells and basophils",
      "D. Immune complex deposition in tissues",
      "E. T cell-mediated activation of macrophages"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient is infected with a filarial parasite such as Wuchereria or Brugia. Filarial parasites have a complex life cycle, beginning with transmission by mosquitoes or other arthropods. The adult worms elicit an inflammatory reaction in the lymphatics, eventually leading to lymphatic obstruction and edema. Microfilariae produced by the adults circulate in the bloodstream until they are ingested by the arthropod vector and develop over 1 to 2 weeks into new infective larvae. The body reacts to tissue parasites, such as filarial worms, by coating them with a thin layer of IgE molecules, which triggers eosinophil-mediated cytotoxicity and the release of vasoactive and spasmogenic substances from mast cells and basophils (local anaphylaxis, a form of type | hypersensitivity). Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and causing death of the cells or tissues (choice A) is a cytotoxic type II hypersensitivity reaction. Transfusion reactions due to mismatched blood are an example. Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and changing the function of the tissue (choice B) is a type II non-cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction. Graves disease and myasthenia gravis are examples. Immune complex deposition in tissues (choice D) is an example of a type III hypersensitivity. It usually takes the form of vasculitis secondary to deposition of circulating antigen-antibody complexes. The Arthus reaction is a specific variant of these reactions in which local vasculitis leads to tissue injury and necrosis, often in the skin. T cell activation of macrophages (choice E) is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The reaction is common with facultative intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes."

      "A. Antihistamine",
      "B. Blocking antibody",
      "C. Cromelyn sodium",
      "D. Epinephrine",
      "E. Theophylline"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Blocking antibody is generally an IgG antibody against the allergen. It is induced in the allergic patient by administering small amounts of allergen over a period of time. When the person is again exposed to the allergen, the IgG reacts with the allergen before it can reach the IgE-coated mast cell. Antihistamines (choice A) would block histamine receptors but would not react with the allergen before it could reach the IgE-coated mast cell. Cromolyn sodium (choice C) is a drug that stabilizes mast cell membranes, thus inhibiting degranulation, but would have no effect on allergen binding to IgE on mast cells. Epinephrine (choice D) is the mainstay of therapy in severe cases of immediate hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis). It increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), thus decreasing mast cell degranulation, and causes smooth-muscle dilation in the airways. Epinephrine would have no effect on the binding of the allergen to IgE on mast cells. cAMP is degraded in cells by the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Theophylline (choice E) inhibits this enzyme, thereby increasing mast cell cAMP levels and making degranulation less likely without affecting the binding of the allergen to IgE on mast cells."

      "D. Type lll hypersensitivity",
      "E. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Urticaria (hives), which this patient has, is a good example of a local anaphylactic reaction, which is classified as a type | hypersensitivity reaction. Type | hypersensitivity reactions involve preformed IgE antibody bound to mast cells or basophils, which then release vasoactive and spasmogenic substances when they react with the allergen. Antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (choice A) occurs when antibodies bound to the Fc receptors of various cells (monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils) target cells, tissues, or pathogens for destruction. It is not involved in the production of urticaria. Type II hypersensitivity (choice C) is caused by autoantibodies against cells or tissues. When these antibodies activate complement or promote phagocytosis, the tissue is damaged. Type III hypersensitivity (choice D) is caused by immune complex deposition in the small diameter blood vessels and the subsequent activation of complement and destruction of the vasculature. The tuberculin (PPD) reaction, used to test for tuberculosis exposure, is an example of delayed-type, or type IV, hypersensitivity (choice E). This response involves TH1 cells and the effector cells of cell-mediated immunity and requires 48 to 72 hours after a second and subsequent exposure to elicit maximum expression."

This condition is an example of localized scleroderma with slow progression to life-threatening complications. CREST syndrome is the combination of calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. Anticentromere antibodies are reported in a high percentage of patients who have CREST syndrome, but only in a small percentage of pure scleroderma patients. Centromeres are the portion of the chromosome where spindle fibers attach during cell division. Antihistone antibody (choice B) is a marker for drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Drugs that can induce systemic lupus erythematosus are hydralazine, isoniazid, and procainamide. Anti-SS-A (choice C) is a marker for Sjogren syndrome, which is characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This man has the symptoms of a 'typical' pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The chest x-ray shows consolidation of the right lower lobe. Typical pneumonia is characterized by high fever, lobar consolidation, and productive sputum. These symptoms are a result of the primary responding immune cell, the neutrophil, which enters the area, releases pyrogenic products (fever), causes innocent bystander damage to the lung (sputum), and creates abscesses (lobar consolidation). Most agents causing typical pneumonia are extracellular organisms, which possess molecules that are chemotactic for neutrophils (f-Met peptides, peptidoglycan, teichoic acids). B lymphocytes (choice A) are most frequently found in the secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes and spleen). They are not primarily associated with the pathology of typical pneumonia, although antibodies and complement will eventually assist in neutrophil phagocytosis of the causal organism. Eosinophils (choice B) predominate in lesions that are either parasitic or allergic in nature. Since neither of these is the case here, they would not be expected to predominate in these lesions. Macrophages (choice C) are called into areas of infection by the cytokines produced by T lymphocytes. Macrophages and T lymphocytes are responsible for the pathology in atypical pneumonias but not in the pathology of typical pneumonia, which usually does not persist long enough for the neutrophil population to be replaced by macrophages. T lymphocytes (choice E) are stimulated by presentation of antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. They are thus primarily stimulated by intracellular pathogens, whose antigens are presented in the groove of the MHC class II molecule of various phagocytic cells. This reaction is responsible for the production of alveolar septa swollen with mononuclear cells, which is the primary manifestation of an atypical pneumonia."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fever. chills, sweating. headache, and body aches. She states that she recently returned from a trip to Malaysia and that the symptoms have occurred every other day. despite acetaminophen and over-the-counter flu medications. Treatment with chloroquine is begun. Which of the following immune cell types is most likely able to clear the causal organism in the erythrocytic stage?",
    "options": [
      "A. Neutrophil",
      "B. NK cells",
      "C. Tc cells",
      "D. TH1",
      "E. TH2"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The patient has malaria, which is caused by four species of intraerythrocytic protozoa belonging to the genus Plasmodium. The erythrocytic stage of malaria would have to be cleared by natural killer (NK) cells due to the lack of MHC molecules on red blood cells (RBCs). The most important protective mechanism in malarial infections is antibody, complement, opsonization and lysis in the spleen, but if a cell-mediated mechanism were to be effective, it would have to be the NK cell, which targets altered cells that do not express MHC class | molecules. Neutrophils (choice A) are cells that cause abscess formation against extracellular microbes. They would not be useful against pathogens with intraerythrocytic locations. Tc cells (choice C) are cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize MHC class I on cells infected with intracellular pathogens. They depend on recognition of MHC class I molecules on infected cells, and therefore are unable to recognize erythrocytes, which lack these molecules. TH1 cells (choice D) help promote cell-mediated immune responses that are important in the protection from intracellular pathogens. TH1 cells produce the cytokines that stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, and the cells of antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). TH1 cells are not themselves responsible for clearing intracellular pathogens, however, and the question asks which cell would be able to clear the infection. TH2 cells (choice E) help promote the production of antibodies by B cells. TH2 cells themselves do not clear intracellular infections, although antibodies, complement, opsonization and phagocytosis play an important role in removal of infected erythrocytes from the spleen in malaria."

A variety of cytokines produced by recombinant DNA are aerosolized and administered twice daily to a group of 20 individuals. Treatment progress is monitored by chest x-ray and sputum culture. Which of the following cytokines is likely to have the most beneficial effect on macrophage intracellular killing of the mycobacteria?",
    "options": [
      "A. Interferon-alpha",

      "D. Interleukin-2",
      "E. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen that lives inside macrophages. The protective immune response to this organism depends on the stimulation of more efficient intracellular killing in phagocytic cells by the cytokines of T helper-1 (TH1) cells. Interferon (IFN)-gamma is a product of TH1 cells that acts on macrophages to enhance their microbicidal activities. IFN-alpha (choice A) is a product of leukocytes that inhibits viral replication. It is unlikely to have an effect on an intracellular bacterial infection. IFN-beta (choice B) is a product of fibroblasts that inhibits viral replication. It is unlikely to have an effect on an intracellular bacterial infection. Interleukin (IL)-2 (choice D) is a product of TH1 cells that causes proliferation (cloning) of other lymphocytes. Because the macrophage is an end cell, incapable of further replication, it would not be affected by IL-2 administration. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (choice E), a product of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, is cytotoxic for tumor cells, induces cytokine production, and causes the cachexia of chronic inflammation. It is unlikely to have a beneficial result on a bacterial infection of macrophages."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient most likely has chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which usually occurs in people over 50 years of age. The symptoms (which may or may not be present) and the physical findings are classic for this disorder. The peripheral smear usually shows an increased number of small, round lymphocytes, with occasional 'smudge cells' (fragile cells disrupted in the process of making a smear). The neoplastic cells have an immunophenotype somewhat like B cells, with IgM, or IgM and IgD, on their surfaces. In addition, both the tumor cells and normal B cells have CD19 and CD20 markers that aid in their identification on flow cytometry. In CLL, the tumor cells may additionally have CD5, a T-cell marker present on a small minority of normal B cells. The CD3 (choice A) marker is present on all T cells. The CD8 (choice B) marker is present on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The CD14 (choice C) marker is used to identify macrophages. The CD16 and CD56 (choice D) markers are present on natural killer (NK) cells."

Which of the following additional findings are most likely to be seen in this patient?",

      "D. Low platelet count and low serum IgG levels",
      "E. Low platelet count and low serum IgM levels"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This clinical scenario is typical for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. This is a X-linked recessive disorder presenting with the triad of thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Serum IgM levels are low, IgG levels are nearly normal, and IgA, and IgE levels are increased. Patients have a defective response to polysaccharide antigens, which is due to a cytoskeletal defect in T cells that inhibits their binding to B cells. A CD4/CD8 ratio of 1.5:1 (choice A) is the pattern seen in AIDS due to selective tropism of the CD4+ T-helper cell population. Cerebellar ataxia (choice B) is part of the ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome. The ataxia develops between age 2 and 5 years. The defect is associated with a DNA repair enzyme deficiency. Elevated platelet count and increased serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE (choice C) are not associated with a particular syndrome. Polyclonal gammopathies result in an increase in immunoglobulin of more than one class. This benign alteration is frequently seen in viral or bacterial infections. Thrombocythemia may be associated with a myeloproliferative syndrome or with a secondary reactive process. Low platelet count and low serum IgG (choice D) are not associated with any particular disorder."

      "C. IL-4",
      "D. IL-5",
      "E. TNF-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient is suffering from toxic shock syndrome, which resulted from growth of Staphylococcus aureus in the surgical packing associated with his tonsilloadenoidectomy. S aureus produces an exotoxin, TSST-1, which acts as a superantigen, crosslinking the T-cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens of unrelated T lymphocytes and macrophages (in the absence of antigen recognition), causing their polyclonal stimulation and the production of dangerous amounts of their cytokines. The cytokines that are overproduced during superantigen pathogenesis are interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (from macrophages), and IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma (from TH1 lymphocytes). IL-1 (choice B) is a product of activated macrophages, not TH1 cells, and would be elevated in toxic shock syndrome. This cytokine is also known as endogenous pyrogen and plays a major role in the development of the fever in these cases. IL-4 (choice C) is a product of TH2 lymphocytes that stimulates the differentiation of B lymphocytes in the humoral immune response. It would not be produced in large amounts in superantigen pathogenesis. IL-5 (choice D) is a product of activated macrophages and TH2 lymphocytes and would be elevated in toxic shock syndrome. This cytokine is a second pyrogen and also mediates the acute phase response. TNF-alpha (choice E) is a product of activated macrophages, not TH1 cells, and would be elevated in toxic shock syndrome. This cytokine is pyrogenic and plays a role in cancer cachexia."

      "A. Antibody formation",
      "B. NK cell function",
      "C. Opsonization",
      "D. Tc-cell activation",
      "E. TH-cell activation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. C3b acts as an opsonin, along with IgG, to facilitate phagocytosis. It is also critically involved in the removal of immune complexes from the blood. Phagocytes have Fc receptors (CD16), which allow them to clear immune complexes from the serum, and immune complexes also activate the complement cascade. C3b is generated in excess during the activation of the classical complement cascade. Antibody formation (choice A) would not be affected by an antibody to C3b. Antibodies are formed by B cells in the bone marrow and secreted by plasma cells in the periphery. C3b has nothing to do with this process. Natural killer (NK) cell function (choice B) is increased by TH1 cytokines, but would not be affected by C3b. Tc-cell activation (choice D) occurs via stimulation with TH1 cytokines, but not C3b. TH-cell activation (choice E) occurs via macrophage presentation of MHC class II molecules loaded with foreign peptides, followed by stimulation with interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It is not altered by C3b."

A protein injected into the skin of the forearm shows a 15-mm indurated swelling 48 hours later. Which of the following immune effector mechanisms has most likely occurred?",
    "options": [
      "A. An Arthus reaction",
      "B. Mast cell degranulation",
      "C. Neutrophil diapedesis",
      "D. TH1 cells have attracted macrophages",
      "E. TH2 cells have activated B cells"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The tuberculin skin test is a delayed-type hypersensitivity test. This type IV hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response involving CD4 T helper-1 (TH1) lymphocytes activating and attracting macrophages into the area. The most important cytokine stimulating this response is interferon-gamma, produced by TH1 cells to activate macrophages. This individual is tuberculin test-positive, and should now have cultures and a chest x-ray to confirm an active case of TB. An Arthus reaction (choice A) has not occurred. The Arthus reaction is an example of a type III (immune complex) hypersensitivity involving antibody, antigen, and complement activation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen, and therefore requires cell-mediated, not antibody-mediated, immunity. Mast cell degranulation (choice B) has not occurred. Mast cells are involved in type | hypersensitivities, along with IgE. Antibodies are not involved in the etiology of type IV hypersensitivity. Neutrophil diapedesis (choice C) has not occurred. Although neutrophils are always the first responders to any injury, by 48 hours they would no longer be the predominant cell in this area. It is not the case that TH2 cells have activated B cells (choice E) because TH2 cells and B cells are involved in the production of the humoral immune response, and the tuberculin response is the classic demonstration of the function of the cell-mediated arm of the immune response."

      "D. IL-10",
      "E. TNF-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The finding of amastigotes inside monocytes and macrophages in the circulation, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow suggests a diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that survives inside macrophages. Therefore, the most effective immune response is cell-mediated, with stimulation of macrophage-killing mechanisms. The most important cytokines to stimulate macrophage microbicidal activity are those produced by TH1 cells, especially interferon (IFN)-gamma. Interleukin (IL)-2 (choice B) is a product of TH1 cells that causes the proliferation (cloning) of other lymphocytes. Because the macrophage is an end cell, incapable of further replication, it would not be affected by IL-2 administration. IL-4 (choice C) is a product of TH2 cells that causes the differentiation of B lymphocytes. It acts antagonistically to TH1 cells, which would mediate the protective response needed in this patient. IL-10 (choice D) is a product of TH2 cells that causes the differentiation of B lymphocytes. It inhibits TH1 cells, which would assist in the protective response needed in this patient. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (choice E) is a product of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells that is cytotoxic for tumor cells, induces cytokine production, and causes the cachexia of chronic inflammation. It is unlikely to have a beneficial result on the microbicidal activity of macrophages."

Flow cytometry of a blood sample shows normal numbers of CD19+, CD16+, and CD8+ cells but a near-total absence of CD4+ cells. Which of the following molecules is most likely absent from this patient's cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gamma-delta T-cell receptor",
      "B. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1",
      "C. Killer inhibitory receptor",
      "D. MHC class |",
      "E. MHC class Il"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This child has major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deficiency, which causes a defect in the development of CD4+ cells in the thymus. Because there is no MHC class II, helper cells cannot be selected. However, cytotoxic cells (CD8+), which recognize MHC class | molecules, are normally produced. This condition is also known as type II bare lymphocyte syndrome, and because helper T cells are required for virtually all immune responses, it will affect the patient's ability to respond to both extra- and intracellular pathogens. The gamma-delta T-cell receptor (choice A) is present on a small proportion of T cells that do not undergo thymic selection. Their function in the body is not known, but they would not be affected by the absence of the class II MHC. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (choice B), found on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the body, reacts with LFA-1 on T cells for the purpose of cell-to-cell adhesion. Its absence would not affect the development of cells in the thymus. The killer inhibitory receptor (choice C) is one of two receptors found on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. It inhibits the killing of an attached cell if it is bound to MHC class |. Because this child has normal levels of CD16+ (NK) cells, it is unlikely she has a deficiency of this receptor. MHC class | (choice D) is the molecule that presents peptides that have been produced intracellularly to CD8+ cytotoxic cells. If this molecule had been absent, the patient would have exhibited susceptibility to intracellular pathogens, and not both intra- and extracellular pathogens as described in this case."

Circulating lymphocytes are all CD-19 positive. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?",

      "A. Adenosine deaminase deficiency",
      "B. Defective CD40L molecule",
      "C. Defective IL-2 receptor",
      "D. Inability to produce MHC-II molecules",
      "E. Nonsense mutation of rag genes"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is associated with deficiencies in both B and T cells due to a defect in differentiation of an early stem cell. Over 50% of cases are caused by a gene defect on the X chromosome, resulting in a defective gamma-chain of receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-11, IL-15 and IL-21. Because of defective signaling from the IL-7 receptor, there is profound decrease in T cell numbers. B cell numbers may be near normal, but antibody synthesis is impaired in the absence of T helper cells. NK cell activity may also be diminished because of the absence of the IL-15 receptor. Adenosine deaminase deficiency (choice A) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a deficiency of adenosine deaminase, which results in accumulation of metabolites that are toxic to both B and T stem cells in the bone marrow. Children with severe infections usually die within the first 2 years of life unless they receive bone marrow transplants. This deficiency produces a SCID, but it is much more rare than deficiencies of IL-2 receptors. A defective CD40L molecule (choice B) causes hyper-IgM syndrome. This makes it impossible for B lymphocytes to receive the signal to switch isotypes, and they are therefore 'stuck' making IgM alone. It is not classified as a SCID. Inability to produce major histocompatibility complex (MHC)II (choice D) causes bare lymphocyte syndrome, which causes patients to be unable to produce CD4 cells. It results in a type of SCID since T-helper (TH) cells are necessary for the function of all immune responses, but is much less common than SCID due to IL-2 receptor deficiency. Nonsense mutation of rag genes (choice E) results in a SCID, because without the ability to perform VDJ recombinations, lymphocytes cannot express surface receptors for antigen, and in that case, lymphocyte precursors are induced to undergo apoptosis in the bone marrow. Recombination activating genes (rag genes) are responsible for the VDJ rearrangements that allow lymphocytes to create the idiotype of their antigen receptors. These are extremely rare conditions."

    "options": ["A. lgA", "B. IgD", "C. IgE", "D. IgG", "E. IgM"],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The first immunoglobulin produced in response to any immunogen is always IgM. This is because of the sequential transcription of the DNA coding for the immunoglobulin isotype genes. The first constant domain that is encoded downstream in the DNA from the idiotype coding is that for IgM and then IgD. These two isotypes are produced and expressed concomitantly. It is not possible for any other immunoglobulin to be made first. The symptoms that this patient is having are the result of a type | hypersensitivity reaction, but in these reactions the IgE antibody is preformed and already bound to mast cell receptors. IgE is not made during the hypersensitivity reaction itself. IgA (choice A), IgE (choice C) and IgG (choice D) can only be produced as a secondary response, i.e., one that follows the primary IgM response. The DNA coding for the IgD (choice B) heavy chain follows that of IgM in the lymphocyte germ-line DNA. Mature, naive B lymphocytes express both IgM and IgD on their surfaces because of alternative RNA splicing, but the complete IgM molecule is always produced first."

      "D. Defect of tyrosine kinase",
      "E. Thymic aplasia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The fact that the boy has had several different infections with pyogenic bacteria requiring antibiotics suggests an inability of phagocytes to kill bacteria. The nitroblue tetrazolium test (NBT) for reactive oxygen intermediates was negative, indicating that the boy suffers from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). CGD is most often due to a defect in NADPH oxidase, which is necessary for leukocyte hydrogen peroxide production. It leads to an inability to kill bacteria and fungi that are catalase-positive. A cytoskeletal defect (choice A) is the underlying lesion in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which causes a triad of symptoms including eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. A defect of IL-2 receptors (choice B) is the most common cause of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). Patients with SCIDs have an inability to mount any immune response, and are therefore susceptible to infections of all types. A patient with SCID would not have the normal immunoglobulin levels and T- and B-cell counts given here. A defect of tyrosine kinase (choice D) is the cause of Bruton agammaglobulinemia. It would cause a blockage of maturation of B lymphocytes, so B-cell numbers in the blood would be depressed and serum immunoglobulin levels would be minimal. These patients are susceptible to extracellular pathogens but have normal abilities to mount delayed-hypersensitivity reactions and responses to intracellular pathogens. Thymic aplasia (choice E) is observed in DiGeorge syndrome as an embryonic failure of formation of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. In such a case, there would be depressed numbers of T cells in the peripheral blood. This is referred to as velocardiofacial syndrome to reflect the fact that such individuals have hypocalcemic tetany (due to malformed parathyroids), malformation of the mouth and face (cleft palate and vertical elongation of the mouth), and cardiac abnormalities (persistent truncus arteriosus)."

      "E. Ouchterlony test to measure precipitating IgG anti-Rh antibody"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The indirect Coombs test is the test of choice to detect the presence of IgG anti-Rh antibody circulating in the mother's blood. Serum is collected from the mother and mixed with Rh-positive red blood cells. If the mother is making the antibody, it will bind to the Rh-positive cells, and when Coombs serum (anti-human IgG) is then added, the erythrocytes will then agglutinate. The direct Coombs test (choice A) is used to diagnose a child at risk for development of hemolytic disease of the newborn. A sample of the child's blood is mixed with Coombs serum (anti-human IgG) and if there is agglutination, it means that the child's erythrocytes have already been coated by maternal anti-Rh antibodies. These antibodies are IgG antibodies that can cross the placenta, and not IgM antibodies (choice B) that would not be able to cause this problem. An indirect Coombs test to measure IgM anti-Rh antibody (choice D) is not available, and would not be useful, since IgM does not cross the placenta and would therefore not cause hemolytic disease of the newborn. An assay for the presence of IgM against erythrocyte antigens would be an agglutination reaction, and not a Coombs test, which requires finding antibodies that have already coated erythrocytes. The Ouchterlony test (choice E), or double-diffusion reaction, is basically used to determine if two antigens are identical, non-identical, or related. It is not the direct Coombs test for hemolytic disease of the newborn (the object is to find the presence of maternal antibodies, not antigens, on the child or in the mother)."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This patient has Wegener granulomatosis, which is characterized by renal involvement, severe upper respiratory tract symptoms, and pulmonary involvement. Other organ systems may also be involved. The renal syndrome is a crescentic, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis leading to renal failure. The upper respiratory tract findings include sinus pain and drainage, and purulent or bloody nasal discharge with or without nasal ulcerations. Nasal septal perforation may follow. Pulmonary involvement may be clinically silent, with only infiltrates present on x-ray, or it may present as cough and hemoptysis. ANCA stands for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and c-ANCA refers to antibody that localizes staining to the cytoplasm of neutrophils. The most common target antigen is proteinase 3 (PR-3). c-ANCA is a marker for Wegener granulomatosis, present in a high percentage of patients. Anticentromere antibody (choice A) is associated with approximately 90% of patients who have CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal motility syndrome, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia), which is also called limited systemic sclerosis. Anti-Ro (choice B) is also called anti-SS-A and is associated with Sjogren syndrome (70-95%). Anti-SS-B (choice C) is associated with Sjogren syndrome (60-90%). p-ANCA (choice E) refers to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies that localize in a perinuclear fashion. These are usually directed against myeloperoxidase in the cell. p-ANCA antibodies can sometimes be seen in Wegener granulomatosis, but are more characteristic of Churg-Strauss syndrome, a medium to small vessel vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. It causes eosinophil-rich inflammation involving the respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium to small sized vessels."

    "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever and cough productive of reddish-brown sputum. She had a splenectomy 1 year ago. A chest x-ray shows consolidation of the right lower lobe. Blood cultures grow α-hemolytic. gram-positive diplococci. Immunity to the most likely causal organism is based on which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alternative complement pathway",
      "B. Antibodies to a capsule",
      "C. Neutrophils",
      "D. NK cells",
      "E. Tc cells"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has pneumococcal pneumonia, which must be considered in any patient with chills, fever, chest pain, and cough productive of purulent, rust-colored sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an α-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in short chains. It can easily be distinguished from other α-hemolytic streptococci because it is exquisitely sensitive to bile and bile-like compounds, such as Optochin. It is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis in adults older than 30 years. The only recognized virulence factor of S. pneumoniae is its carbohydrate capsule (which contains acidic polysaccharides). Antibody to a specific capsule type is necessary to overcome infection. More than 80 capsule types have been recognized. The 23 types that most commonly cause disease are contained in a vaccine that is recommended for high-risk groups, including the elderly and those undergoing splenectomy. Increased susceptibility is also found in patients with Hodgkin disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloma. The vaccine should still be given to patients with these conditions, but it is less protective because of diminished patient ability to mount an antibody response. The alternative complement pathway (choice A) is important in clearing Neisseria infections. Individuals with deficiencies in C5 through C8 are at increased risk of disease from Neisseria. Neutrophils (choice C) will be found in the sputum of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, but they do not provide immunity. They are attracted to the area by N-formyl methionine peptides found in the bacteria, but have difficulty engulfing the organism due to the antiphagocytic nature of the capsule. T cells and NK cells (choices D and E) are predominantly used for the clearance of intracellular pathogens, and pneumococcal pneumonia is an extracellular pathogen."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman comes to the physician for a pre-employment physical examination. She says that as a child she experienced two episodes of fever, headache, and sore joints following severe sore throats. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following sequelae of her childhood illness is most likely to develop in this patient as she grows older?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arthritis",
      "B. Fibrinous pericarditis",
      "C. Mitral valve disease",
      "D. Myocarditis",
      "E. Neurologic disease"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. After an initial attack of rheumatic fever, an affected individual is at increased risk for developing recurrent rheumatic disease after each pharyngeal infection by beta-hemolytic streptococci. Any one of the manifestations of rheumatic disease can recur, but will usually resolve. The damage to the heart valves caused by rheumatic fever can lead to fibrous scarring and deformity, producing valvular dysfunction (particularly mitral stenosis) that may lead to heart failure in late adulthood. This is an example of a type II hypersensitivity reaction in which tissue-specific autoantibodies cause damage to host tissues. The inflammatory response associated with type II hypersensitivities is usually localized rather than systemic. The arthritis (choice A) produced by rheumatic fever is transitory and resolves after the attack has run its course. There are no long-term complications of the arthritis. Fibrinous pericarditis (choice B), like almost any fibrinous inflammatory response, is an acute process. Although the patient may develop some scarring of the pericardium, this is generally not sufficient to produce long-lasting consequences. Myocardial involvement (choice D) by rheumatic fever is typically seen as Aschoff bodies, collections of fibrinoid necrosis, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes within the myocardium. When the event resolves, the Aschoff bodies will be replaced by discrete fibrous scars. No appreciable myocardial dysfunction ensues. Sydenham chorea, the neurologic manifestation of rheumatic fever, leaves no lasting neurologic effects (choice E)."

    "question": "A 33-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a deep puncture wound in her right hand. A shard of glass is removed from the patient's hand, and the wound is appropriately cleaned and treated at the time of the accident. Twelve hours later, the wound becomes inflamed and swollen despite appropriate therapy. Which of the following molecules plays an important role in producing chemotaxis of white blood cells into this area?",
    "options": ["A. C3b", "B. C5a", "C. IgM", "D. IL-2", "E. Lysozyme"],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. In active inflammation, the complement system has been activated and C5a is being produced. C5a is a strong chemoattractant to neutrophils and other phagocytic cells. Other chemotactic factors for neutrophils include IL-8, fibrinopeptides, leukotriene B4, and formyl methionyl peptides from bacteria. C3b (choice A) acts as an opsonin for microorganisms. When the organism is coated with C3b, it is more easily phagocytized. C3b is formed via the classical and alternative complement pathways, but it is not chemotactic for neutrophils. IgM (choice C) is the large antibody produced in the primary immune response. It is not chemotactic for neutrophils. IL-2 (choice D) is a growth-promoting interleukin that stimulates the proliferation of natural killer cells, and T-cytotoxic cells, and T-helper lymphocytes, but it is not chemotactic for neutrophils. Lysozyme (choice E) is a natural antibacterial present in tears, mucus, vaginal secretions, and other body fluids. It is active against the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls, splitting the backbone structure of the peptidoglycan (N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid polymers). It is not chemotactic for neutrophils."

    "question": "A 15-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of sore throat, rhinorrhea. fever, and productive cough. A review of his records shows that this is the seventh time over the last 6 months that the child has been brought to the emergency department because of an illness. Prior visits have been because of infections involving the skin, ear, and respiratory tract. Laboratory studies show extremely low levels of serum IgG and an absence of CD19+ cells. Which of the following genes is likely mutated or deficient in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenosine deaminase",
      "B. Bruton tyrosine kinase",
      "C. CD18",
      "D. CD40L",
      "E. NADPH oxidase"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Bruton x-linked agammaglobulinemia is the only one of the humoral immune deficiencies in which there are no peripheral B cells (no CD19+ cells). The mutation is in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene (Btk) that is required for pre-B cells to develop to immature B cells in the bone marrow. Adenosine deaminase deficiency (choice A) is the deficiency in one form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. CD18 (choice C) is deficient in leukocyte adhesion deficiency, leading to failure of diapedesis, in which leukocytes are unable to extravasate to an area of inflammation due to lack of the common beta chain of integrin molecules. CD40L (choice D) is missing in hyper-IgM syndrome, in which IgM-producing B cells cannot receive the signal to isotype-switch to production of IgA, IgG, and IgE. The actual deficiency is in TH cells that are deficient in expression of CD40L. NADPH oxidase (choice E) is the enzyme that is deficient in chronic granulomatous disease, which will then result in an inability to generate toxic oxygen metabolites inside phagocytic cells. This would cause increased susceptibility to catalase-positive organisms, but would not result in diminished numbers of circulating B lymphocytes or reduced immunoglobulin levels."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of frequent upper respiratory tract infections. His mother says that he was delivered at 39 weeks' gestation and that the pregnancy was uneventful. A review of his records shows that he is up-to-date on all his immunizations. He has had three hospitalizations in the past year for pneumonia. Laboratory studies will most likely show a deficiency of which of the following immunoglobulins in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. A dimeric immunoglobulin",
      "B. A pentameric immunoglobulin",
      "C. An immunoglobulin that binds to mast cells",
      "D. An immunoglobulin that is an antigen receptor on mature naive B lymphocytes",
      "E. An immunoglobulin that mediates antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Selective IgA deficiency (<5 mg/dL) is the most common of all the primary immunodeficiency diseases. The incidence reported in the United States has ranged from 1:250 to 1:1,000. Recurrent bacterial and viral infections of the respiratory tract can be attributed to a lack of secretory IgA (sIgA), the predominant immunoglobulin of the mucosal immune system. IgA is a dimer held together by a single J chain, and a secretory component is added by mucosal cells as it is transported into the lumen of the organ system. Children typically do not begin to develop severe signs of this deficiency until their second year of life because maternally acquired IgG (across the placenta) and IgA (in breast milk) protect the child for the first year of life. A pentameric immunoglobulin (choice B) describes serum IgM. This is the most important immunoglobulin of the primary immune response, but it is not important in protection against mucosal surface pathogens. An immunoglobulin that binds to mast cells (choice C) describes IgE. It is involved in the mediation of type | hypersensitivity responses and anti-parasite responses. An immunoglobulin that is an antigen receptor on mature naive B lymphocytes (choice D) describes IgD. Its only known function is as an antigen receptor on the surface of mature naive B lymphocytes. An immunoglobulin that mediates antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (choice E) describes IgG. The binding of the Fc region of IgG molecules to natural killer cells, neutrophils, and macrophages can cause destruction of cells targeted by the antibody."

    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of fever of recent onset and pain and swelling of his knees and ankles. He had an upper respiratory infection 2 weeks ago, for which he received acetaminophen. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 22/min. and blood pressure is 115/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows erythematous skin macules with a clear center, arthritis, and small subcutaneous nodules on the dorsal aspect of the arms. A systolic murmur in the mid-precordial area is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following is the most likely immunopathogenetic mechanism responsible for this condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Type | hypersensitivity",
      "B. Type Il hypersensitivity",
      "C. Type lll hypersensitivity",
      "D. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The clinical manifestations fulfill the diagnostic criteria for rheumatic disease, a condition characterized by pancarditis (endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis), arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, chorea, and erythema marginatum. A history of pharyngitis, otitis, or other streptococcal infections preceding the onset of the disease by 2-3 weeks is usually elicited. The triggering etiologic agent is group A Streptococcus, which incites production of antistreptococcal antibodies that cross-react with antigens of heart, skin, and nervous tissues. The antibodies bind fixed antigens and trigger an acute inflammatory response that eventually resolves with permanent scarring. This type of hypersensitivity response, in which autoantibodies bind antigens on cells or tissues, is classified as type II. Other examples of type II hypersensitivity-mediated diseases include Graves disease (the autoantibodies stimulate hormone production by binding thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] receptors) and myasthenia gravis (the autoantibodies interfere with cholinergic neuromuscular transmission by binding nicotinic receptors). Type | hypersensitivity (choice A) is mediated by IgE. Antigens bind IgE on the surface of mast cells and trigger the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine and heparin, and then activation of the arachidonic acid cascade causes production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Asthma and urticaria are classic examples of this immune mechanism. Type III hypersensitivity (choice C) is mediated by soluble immune complexes, i.e., antigen-antibody complexes. Diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and various types of vasculitis are due to this mechanism. Type IV hypersensitivity (choice D) is mediated by T lymphocytes and often results in formation of granulomas. Granulomatous inflammation caused by Mycobacteria is an example of a type IV cell-mediated reaction."

      "D. Syngeneic graft",
      "E. xenograft"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. A transplant between two members of the same species who are not genetically identical is an allogeneic graft. This is the most commonly performed graft in today's medicine. An autograft (choice B) is a graft from one location to another on the same individual. This is the only type of graft that will not experience rejection, even without immunosuppressive drugs. This type of transplantation is performed in coronary bypass surgery and in skin grafting following burns. Isografts and syngeneic grafts (choices C and D) are grafts between monozygotic twins. Typically, this procedure in the human is called an isograft; in other species it is called a syngeneic graft. Even monozygotic twins have genetic distinctions that arise during gestation and development, so some level of immunosuppression is still required following this form of engraftment. A xenograft (choice E) is a transplant between members of different species. Pig heart valves are often used in humans in this way."

      "D. No true cell wall",
      "E. Visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Having both hyphae and spores (choice B) would be true of Candida, which usually causes arthritis as a rare complication of systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma do not have true cell walls (choice D) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete that is visible only with darkfield microscopy (choice E) or direct fluorescent antibody.

      "A. catalase",
      "B. Hemolysin",
      "C. Hyaluronidase",
      "D. streptokinase",
      "E. Tetanospasmin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome. Tetanospasmin (choice E) is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It inhibits the inhibitory mediators glycine and GABA, and promotes the rigid paralysis of tetanus. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome."

    "options": [
      "A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "E. Streptococcus salivarius"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx; constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx and a tonsillar exudate. Streptococcus salivarius (choice E) is a gram-positive coccus that is usually alpha-hemolytic. It is normal flora of the oral cavity and is sometimes implicated in subacute bacterial endocarditis, but is not associated with tonsillar abscesses."

      "F. Streptococcus sanguis"

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Streptococcus bovis is a group D Streptococcus. There is a significant association between S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon and other colonic diseases. Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are reported to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. The group D Streptococci are distinguished by having a cell wall carbohydrate composed of glycerol teichoic acid. S. agalactiae (choice A) is a group B Streptococcus that is the number-one cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia in the United States. S. mutans and S. sanguis (choices C and F) are viridans streptococci, which are normal flora of the oral mucosa.

      "E. Virus, p24, RNA Undetectable | CD4+ Normal | Anti-p24 Decreasing | Anti-env Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 525/mm³, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient, measured by RT-PCR for viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Antibodies against the envelope glycoproteins are generally IgM, which does not require a primary immune response. The IgM anti-env antibody can be made in the absence of TH cells. Increasing p24 virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood. This does not happen in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This young woman is infected with Chlamydia trachomatis the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells. It has sterols in its membrane (choice A) is a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These are the only prokaryotes that totally lack a cell wall, but instead have sterols in their membranes. It lacks a cell wall (choice B) is also a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These prokaryotes are devoid of a cell wall but have sterols in their membranes. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol (choice C) is a statement that describes the fungi. The ergosterol molecule is unique to fungi and is the target molecule for nystatin and the imidazoles.

      "D. It interferes with mitotic spindle function",
      "E. It interferes with thymidylate synthetase and DNA synthesis"

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test, the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the “conazole” antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A). This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patients oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum. Flucytosine interferes with thymidylate synthetase (choice E). This agent is used in the treatment of cryptococcosis.

    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. High mutational rate",
      "C. Phenotypic mixing",
      "D. segmented genome",
      "E. Syncytia formation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

      "A. Ecthyma gangrenosum",
      "B. Erythema migrans",
      "C. Food poisoning",
      "D. Nonmycotic mycetoma",
      "E. Pharyngitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes malignant otitis externa which is a severe necrotizing infection of the external ear canal. Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone, temporal bone, sigmoid sinus, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Patients at increased risk include the elderly, people with diabetes, and the immunocompromised. Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes (since the organism can be cultured from the shoes), burn infections, and pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients. Ecthyma gangrenosum is the name of the characteristic lesion that occurs during Pseudomonas septicemias. It has a black, necrotic center and a raised hemorrhagic ring outside. Erythema migrans (choice B) is the target-shaped rash that occurs in the early stages of Lyme disease. Food poisoning (choice C) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas. Nonmycotic mycetoma (choice D) is caused by Actinomyces and Nocardia. Pharyngitis (choice E) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas."

      "D. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus",
      "E. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, naked, icosahedral virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Outbreaks occur seasonally in winter and early spring. Infection does not result in lasting immunity, and reinfection can occur. The virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, a group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are nonsegmented, helical, and enveloped. Double-stranded DNA, naked, icosahedral virus (choice A) describes the Adenoviruses, which are capable of causing conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. However, these agents are not common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Negative-sense single-stranded RNA with eight segments, helical, enveloped virus (choice C) describes the Orthomyxoviruses, which include influenza virus. Influenza is a systemic illness characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache myalgias, malaise, and prostration, followed by cough, nasal obstruction, and sore throat. The lower respiratory tract may also be involved. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus (choice D) describes the Coronaviruses, which cause the common cold (nasal obstruction and discharge, sneezing, mild or no fever, occasional sore throat, and/or cough) and acute pharyngitis (sore throat with or without cervical adenopathy, ulceration, and conjunctivitis). SARS-CoV also belongs to this family and causes a seasonal acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is usually imported into this hemisphere from the Far East. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA naked, icosahedral virus (choice E) describes the Picornaviruses and Caliciviruses. Within the Picornaviridae, rhinoviruses cause the common cold but would not be common agents of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants."

    "question": "A diagram of a resistance transfer factor is shown. Which of the following do the rectangular blocks identified by the arrows represent?",

      "A. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes",
      "B. Introns",
      "C. Points of bacteriophage insertion",
      "D. Points of site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. A resistance transfer factor is a bacterial plasmid that encodes one or more drug-resistance genes and has the capability of mediating its own transfer to another bacterium during conjugation (it possesses the F operon). Most of the known resistance transfer factors have been formed by the accumulation of transposons into fertility factor plasmids. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are capable of movement within bacterial cells. When they carry drug-resistance genes and accumulate in plasmids that already possess the F operon, multiple drug-resistant plasmids (resistance transfer factors) are formed. The flanking sequences in the DNA of a transposon are indirect repeats that are complementary and antiparallel to one another. When transposons insert themselves into a new location, they do so by site-specific recombination, creating direct repeats (identical nucleotide sequences created during the repair of a staggered cut created by the transposon restriction endonuclease). Therefore, in the diagram shown, the rectangular blocks could represent either the direct repeats caused by transposition or the indirect repeats that are the outside edges of the mobile segments of DNA. In either event, they are representations of points at which transposons have inserted their mobile DNA via site-specific recombination. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes (choice A) is not correct. Although each transposon (and there are three that have moved to create the resistance transfer factor shown) carries its own restriction endonuclease and the gene that encodes it, the diagram clearly shows the presence of two rectangles for each of the transposons, and a given transposon would carry only one copy, not two copies, of its endonuclease gene. Introns (choice B) are repetitive, non-transcribed segments of DNA that do not occur in prokaryotes. Points of bacteriophage insertion (choice C) or insertion sequences are palindromic sequences of nucleotides in a bacterial genome that are identical to those found in the genomes of temperate phages. When these sequences are cleaved by a restriction endonuclease the phage genome can be inserted by site-specific recombination into the bacterial chromosome and the state of lysogeny is begun. Bacteriophages are not involved in the formation of resistance transfer factors. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are responsible for the formation of multiple drug-resistant plasmids such as the one shown here, but they are not represented by the rectangular blocks. In the diagram, the transposons are the sequences between the rectangular blocks, so there are three transposons that accumulated here to create this resistance transfer factor."

    "question": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain over the past 24 hours. She recently returned from a 4-month trip to Central America. She says that she had bloody diarrhea for the last 4 weeks of her trip. A CT scan of the abdomen shows lesions that appear to be multiple abscesses. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "C. Enterobius vermicularis",
      "D. Salmonella typhi",
      "E. Shigella species"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient probably has hepatic amebiasis, which is a life-threatening complication of intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. E. histolytica is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Intestinal colonization (which may be asymptomatic) always precedes infection of the liver. The abscesses generally contain necrotic debris, with amoebas located along the edges of the abscess. Treatment for liver abscesses of this origin is metronidazole, while iodoquinol is useful to destroy the luminal stages of the parasite. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) can cause intestinal obstruction, and may cause abscesses if it invades the common bile duct. It would not cause bloody diarrhea. Enterobius vermicularis (choice C) is the pinworm, which inhabits the rectum. Bloody diarrhea can also be seen with some strains of Salmonella (choice D) and Shigella (choice E), but these organisms do not usually cause hepatic abscesses. Bacterial causes of hepatic abscesses include E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas."

      "E. Septate hyphae at 45-degree angles",
      "F. spherules"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This is a classic case of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis. Clues include the patient population (HIV-positive), and the CSF findings suggesting a fungal etiology. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal meningitis of the immunocompromised in the United States. It is a monomorphic fungus, unlike many of the classic pathogens within the fungal group, so the encapsulated yeast form would be found both in clinical specimens and in the environment as the infectious form. Broad-based, budding yeasts (choice A) would be the forms expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Blastomyces dermatitidis - which is far more likely to present with skin and bone lesions than with meningitis. Budding yeasts in a 'pilot's wheel' arrangement (choice B) would be the form expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis which is limited in geographic region to Central and South America and typically presents as a primary pulmonary disease. Intracellular yeasts within macrophages (choice D) are the diagnostic form of Histoplasma capsulatum which, despite its name, is not an encapsulated yeast. It is primarily a pulmonary infection acquired by exposure to the droppings of birds or bats. Septate hyphae with 45-degree angles (choice E) are the transmission forms of Aspergillus which is a major opportunistic infection. Aspergillus may cause meningitis in this patient population, but it is not nearly as common as Cryptococcus. Spherules (choice F) would be the yeast forms characteristic of Coccidioides immitis which may be a cause of fungal meningitis in immunologically compromised individuals but is geographically restricted to the Sonoran desert zone of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever)."

The physician should monitor this pregnancy closely for the development of which of the fetal conditions?",
    "options": [
      "A. Congenital heart disease",
      "B. Cutaneous scarring",
      "C. Hemolytic anemia",
      "D. Hydrocephalus",
      "E. Non-immune hydrops"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. There are two parts to this question. The first is realizing that the student's illness is the classic description of Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum. It is caused by parvovirus B19, which is spread from human to human. Animals do not carry this particular parvovirus. The disease is contagious prior to the onset of the rash. The initial symptoms, during the period of contagion, are nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, myalgia, lethargy, coryza, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain. When the typical 'slapped-cheek' rash begins, the student is no longer contagious. The rash begins with the erythematous cheeks, then the upper part of the body becomes red and then reticulated, i.e., the typical lacy appearance of the rash develops. This fades but can come and go for the next 3 weeks. Parvovirus is a cause of aplastic anemia. It may be responsible for aplastic crises in patients with sickle-cell anemia. In addition, exposure of a pregnant woman in the first trimester may result in a fetus with aplastic anemia, which results in non-immune hydrops fetalis. Because the virus infects immature erythrocytes, causing severe anemia, the fetus dies of cardiac failure. Congenital heart defects (choice A) may occur due to many different reasons. They are, however associated with the congenital rubella syndrome, in which a patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis are most commonly seen. Cutaneous scarring (choice B) occurs in an infant with congenital varicella syndrome (exposure to varicella during pregnancy). The other major feature is limb defects. Hemolytic anemias (choice C) are usually not associated with prenatal exposure to an infectious agent. They may be produced due to isoimmunization (Rh disease), red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis), or red cell enzyme defects (pyruvate kinase deficiency), as well as many other etiologies. Hydrocephalus (choice D) also has diverse etiologies. There is an association with prenatal exposure to mumps and the fetal development of aqueductal stenosis resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus."

    "question": "An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a fever, sore throat, and rash. Physical examination shows an exudative pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy and tenderness, and a diffuse, sandpaper-like erythematous rash. Which of the following mechanisms is responsible for the expression of the toxin that produces these signs?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Homologous recombination",
      "C. Lysogenic conversion",
      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The question describes a girl with streptococcal pharyngitis with a characteristic rash. This combination is scarlet fever, and is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes via its erythrogenic exotoxin (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, SPE). SPE-A, SPE-B, and SPE-C. The production of this extra virulence is an example of lysogenic conversion. In this case, the DNA of a temperate phage is inserted into the bacterial chromosome and produces a prophage. Besides the repressor protein, the prophage DNA also directs the synthesis of other gene products that make the bacteria more pathogenic. Conjugation (choice A) is one of the three methods whereby DNA is transferred from one cell to another. In this case, it is done by cell-to-cell contact. It is not the means by which the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins are expressed. Homologous recombination (choice B) is a gene exchange process that stabilizes some genes that have been introduced by conjugation, transformation, or transduction. During the process there is an exchange of pieces of DNA between a linear piece of DNA and a region on the stable circular bacterial chromosome. In site-specific recombination (choice D) a DNA molecule is integrated into a molecule of DNA with which it has no homology, except for a small site on each DNA that is called an insertion site. The end result is the sum of the two original DNA molecules. Transformation (choice E) is another way in which genes are transferred. In this case, naked DNA is taken up by another cell. Cells that can take up naked DNA from the environment need to become competent, and do so under certain environmental conditions. The newly introduced DNA is generally linear, homologous DNA from the same type of cell, but one that may be genetically diverse. Once introduced into the new cell, some genes may become stabilized by homologous recombination."

    "question": "During an investigational study, new combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules are found on the progeny viruses of a prevalent serotype of the swine influenza virus and the prevalent serotype of the human influenza virus. The progeny viruses are genetically stable when purified and are used to infect new tissue cultures. Which of the following mechanisms most likely accounts for the production of the new viral progeny?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. Genetic drift",
      "C. Genetic shift",
      "D. Phenotypic masking",
      "E. Phenotypic mixing"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza and other viruses with segmented genomes (Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus) are capable of genetic reassortment. This is an accidental 'shuffling' of the segments of genomic RNA so that new genetic combinations can be produced. Viruses that have segmented genomes have multiple pieces of RNA that must be assembled correctly in the progeny to produce a new generation that is identical to the parental generation. When accidental rearrangements occur, genetic shift results; and in influenza, this is responsible for the production of pandemics of disease. Complementation (choice A) occurs when two viruses infect a single cell. If one is defective in a certain gene product, progeny viruses can be produced as long as that defect can be 'complemented' by the makeup of the other virus. If both viruses have the same defect, no progeny viruses can be produced. In the case given here, two viable viruses were grown in a single cell and new combinations of surface molecules were produced. Genetic drift (choice B) refers to random mutational changes that can occur in any reproducing organism. These changes can change the surface of the organism, which affects the host immune response to the organism. Changes such as these are more gradual than genetic shift, and are best described in viruses such as HIV. Phenotypic masking (choice D) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is created from the genome of one of the viruses while the genome included in the capsid is from the other virus. Thus, one genome is 'masked' or covered with the antigens of the other virus. In the case described here, combinations of surface molecules were expressed. Phenotypic mixing (choice E) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is a mixture of the capsid antigens from the two parental viruses. Since the genomic RNA is not actually reassorted in that case, it would not be a stable genetic change but simply a reflection of the antigens of both parental viruses being inserted on the surfaces of a single progeny generation."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen that is associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and that commonly causes cystitis. It is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod that reduces nitrates to nitrites. It is important to know that the pili and motility of the bacteria contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with cystitis can develop bacteremia and subsequent septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The present patient has an obstructive lesion of the urinary tract that predisposes him to the overgrowth of microorganisms such as E. coli. Pulmonary symptoms are consistent with ARDS. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) might be a Neisseria sp. or Moraxella catarrhalis. N. gonorrhoeae is the cause of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that presents asymptomatically or with urethritis. Patients are usually younger and sexually active. M. catarrhalis is usually implicated as a cause of otitis media and sinusitis in children. It is also implicated as a cause of purulent tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in a population of patients who are older than 50 years and who have underlying obstructive lung disease. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis rarely cause cystitis. S. saprophyticus causes UTIs but the patients are typically young, sexually active women. Enterococcus is a relatively common cause of UTIs in hospitalized patients with indwelling urinary catheters who are receiving broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Enterococcal bacteremia can lead to endocarditis, but would not commonly cause ARDS. Gram-positive diplococci (choice D) would be a description of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Gram-positive rods (choice E) would include members of the following genera: Clostridium, Bacillus, Listeria, and Corynebacterium. The only significant member of this group to produce UTIs is Corynebacterium urealyticum (C. jeikeium). This organism creates an alkaline urine environment with the potential for stone formation. Patients are usually immunocompromised or have had recurrent UTIs."

These infections are most common in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America and are associated with a very high mortality among pregnant women. Hepatitis E is caused by a naked capsid RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae (formerly Caliciviridae). Adenoviridae (choice A) is a group of naked capsid double-stranded DNA viruses that may cause upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis, but are not generally associated with hepatitis.

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Most RNA viruses (e.g., poliovirus) replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore can replicate in enucleated cells. Poliovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae. These viruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA. The exception to the rule regarding RNA viruses is the family Orthomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses (choice C). Orthomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral mRNA transcription. Adenoviruses (choice A) are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome. All DNA viruses except the family Poxviridae carry out their replication in the nucleus, and therefore would not be capable of completing their life cycles in enucleated cells. Cytomegalovirus (choice B) is a member of family Herpesviridae. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome, and thus replicates in the nucleus. JC virus (choice D) belongs to family Polyomaviridae.

During the lag time by definition, bacteria newly introduced into a culture will undergo metabolic changes necessary for use of the medium, but will not increase in number. Therefore, at the end of the first 30 minutes of elapsed time the number of bacteria in the culture will be 2 x 10². Thereafter, the number of bacteria will double every 20 minutes (the definition of 'generation time'). This means that after 2.5 hours (150 minutes) of total elapsed time, 120 minutes (150 min - 30 min lag) will be available for growth. Since generation time is 20 minutes, six generations will have occurred (120 min / 20 min/gen = 6 gen). So the original inoculum will double six times: 2 x 10² * 2⁶ = 2 x 10² * 64 = 128 x 10². Choice A (6 x 10²) is not the correct answer. The student who selects this answer forgot that lag periods occur only once per culture, and also incorrectly multiplied the starting inoculum number by an incorrect number of generations (three). Choice B (12 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of counting the number of possible generations and multiplying by that number. Remember that every generation time means that every bacterium in that culture has divided into two, so the student must multiply by 2 six times, or 2⁶. Choice C (16 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of forgetting that the lag time occurs only one time per culture. The student who selects this answer divided the 2.5 hours of culture time between three lag periods and three correctly calculated generations (2³). Choice D (32 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of including the lag period within the first generation time (overlapping the two, and forgetting that they are distinct and separate periods). The student who did this would therefore count five possible generations and, multiplying correctly thereafter by 2⁵, would arrive at this incorrect answer."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man with AIDS develops multifocal encephalitis. He reports having a unilateral, vesicular rash 1 month ago Treatment with acyclovir is begun, but he dies on the fourth day after admission. Which of the following viruses is most likely responsible for the development of encephalitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus",
      "B. Herpes simplex type-1",
      "C. Herpes simplex type-2",
      "D. Herpes zoster",
      "E. Measles virus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The specific clue to the cause of the severe encephalitis in this AIDS patient is the history of shingles, due to reactivation of the herpes zoster (varicella zoster) virus. In otherwise healthy adults, the virus (which is usually introduced to the body as a childhood case of chickenpox) remains dormant in a dorsal root ganglion only to reactivate in later life, causing a painful vesicular eruption that characteristically conforms to the distribution of a single dermatome. In AIDS patients, the virus can cause a severe multifocal encephalitis that may be resistant to acyclovir therapy. Cytomegalovirus (choice A) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but is less likely in the present patient, given his past history of shingles. Herpes simplex type-1 (choice B) and type-2 (choice C) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but are less likely in this patient, given his past history of shingles and the lack of response to acyclovir. Measles virus (choice E) appears to be related to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis but this condition is not specifically increased in AIDS patients."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes comes to the physician because of an unresolved skin lesion on his foot. The lesion appeared several weeks ago, but recently has expanded and become painful. Physical examination shows a 5-cm lesion with a black, necrotic center and raised erythematous edges. Which of the following toxins has a mechanism of action most similar to the toxin most likely responsible for this patient's skin lesion?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anthrax toxin",
      "B. Botulinum toxin",
      "C. Cholera toxin",
      "D. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin",
      "E. Diphtheria toxin",
      "F. Escherichia coli labile toxin",
      "G. Pertussis toxin",
      "H. Shigatoxin",
      "I. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins",
      "J. Tetanus toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient's wound is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the characteristic lesion described is called ecthyma gangrenosum. The Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which is responsible for the tissue damage, inhibits protein synthesis by acting on EF-2, with a primary target cell in the liver. The diphtheria toxin has a similar action, although its target cells are heart and nerve. Anthrax toxin (choice A) is a three-component toxin that contains a single binding component (protective antigen) and two active components. The edema factor (EF) is an adenylate cyclase that causes fluid loss from cells, and the lethal factor (LF) is an endoprotease that causes apoptosis. Botulinum toxin (choice B) is a neurotoxin that prevents neurosecretory vesicles from fusing with synaptic membranes and releasing acetylcholine. Cholera toxin (choice C) acts to increase adenylate cyclase activity by ribosylation of GTP-binding protein. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (choice D) is a lecithinase. Escherichia coli labile toxin (choice F) works in a fashion similar to the cholera toxin. Pertussis toxin (choice G) causes fluid loss by ribosylating Gi. Shigatoxin (choice H) decreases protein synthesis by inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins (choice I) act as superantigens to increase cytokine production. Tetanus toxin (choice J) is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA."

    "question": "A 4-year-old girl who recently emigrated from Somalia is brought fo the emergency department by her parents because of a fever and persistent cough. Her temperature is 40.1°C (104.2°F). Physical examination shows inspiratory stridor, and a thick, gray film covering the uvula and pharynx that bleeds when displaced with a tongue depressor. Cultures of the oropharyngeal secretions grow gram-positive rods. In the image above, the patient's isolate is strain 1. Which of the following best describes strain 1?",
    "options": [
      "A. It contains an episome",
      "B. It contains free plasmid DNA",
      "C. It contains a prophage",
      "D. It is not a diphtheroid",
      "E. It is a motile organism"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has developed diphtheria, which is rare in the United States because of our use of a very effective vaccine, the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis). Immigrant children from impoverished areas of the globe might not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is a gram-positive rod that is morphologically identical to normal flora organisms in the oropharynx, which are called diphtheroids. The difference between the pathogen and a normal flora diphtheroid is established using the ELEK test, which is shown in the image. This test involves diffusion in gel and a precipitation reaction that will occur when antigen (toxin) produced by the pathogen precipitates in the presence of antitoxin antibodies. In the image, the horizontal lines are the strains of bacteria to be tested for the production of the toxin. The vertical rectangle is a strip of filter paper that has been soaked in antitoxin antibodies. The white lines that form in the right angle where bacteria and filter paper meet are lines of precipitation. In C. diphtheriae, toxin production occurs following infection of the bacterium with a temperate phage that encodes the toxin. This is an example of lysogenic conversion. Episomes (choice A) are plasmids that have integrated into a bacterial chromosome; Diphtheria toxin is produced following stable integration of a phage genome into the chromosome, not due to the integration of plasmid DNA. Containing free plasmid DNA (choice B) is not the distinction between toxin-producing and non-producing strains of C. diphtheriae. The tetanus toxin is produced by virtue of possession of a non-conjugative plasmid by Clostridium tetani, but this is not true of diphtheria. It is not a diphtheroid (choice D). A diphtheroid is a non-toxin producing strain of C. diphtheriae (a normal flora organism). The strains that are streaked in the image as the two central lines are non-toxin producers (diphtheroids). It is a motile organism (choice E) is not the case and motility is not tested by the ELEK test. C. diphtheriae is a nonmotile organism, and the eventual development of peripheral neuropathies and cardiomyopathies during the pathogenesis are a result of the fact that the toxin becomes bloodborne, not that the organism moves from its site of residence in the oropharynx and upper airways."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man who is a farmer develops a pustule on the hand. The pustule ruptures to form a black eschar surrounded by expanding edema. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the development of these symptoms in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. A boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod",
      "B. A cigar-shaped yeast",
      "C. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine",
      "D. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining",
      "E. A large spirochete"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causative organism, Bacillus anthracis is found in many animal species, and humans can acquire the organism either through contact with animals or from locally contaminated soil. The pustule described in the question stem is called a 'malignant pustule' and may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy. Malignant pustules after rupture form a black eschar surrounded by edema. Most cases remain localized but death can occur as the result of complications such as bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Bacillus is a large, boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod that forms spores centrally placed inside the bacillus, so that they look like bamboo shoots. A cigar-shaped yeast (choice B) describes the tissue form of Sporothrix schenckii, the agent of rose-gardener's disease. The lesion in such a case would be a mycetoma, draining yellow granular pus through multiple sinus tracts. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine (choice C) describes Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. The organism can persist for weeks to months but does not form spores that could survive for hundreds or thousands of years. Most human cases occur in the endemic areas of the United States, in Arkansas and Missouri. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining (choice D) describes Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague. This organism does not form stable spores that can survive for extended periods of time. The hallmark of bubonic plague is the formation of buboes which are black, necrotic lymph nodes that form at the site of the vector fleabite. A large spirochete (choice E) describes Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme disease. In the first stage of this disease, there is a localized, expanding, erythematous rash rather than an eschar. Furthermore, Lyme disease occurs in the United States, Europe, and Asia, corresponding to the distribution of Ixodes ticks, which spread the infection."

    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative diplococci",
      "B. Gram-negative rods",
      "C. Gram-positive cocci",
      "D. Gram-positive rods",
      "E. Monomorphic yeast",
      "F. Septate hyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in this case are consistent with a fungal infection in the central nervous system (100-1000 cells, mostly lymphocytes, glucose <50 mg/dL, protein >=50 mg/dL). Cryptococcus is a monomorphic encapsulated yeast. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. While this patient is in the appropriate age group for meningococcal meningitis, his HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Gram-negative rods (choice B) would be indicative of any of the enteric organisms, particularly Escherichia coli. E. coli is an agent of neonatal meningitis and septicemia, but the patient's HIV status, age, and CSF findings refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) would be indicative of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of adult meningitis, but the CSF findings in this case refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive rods (choice D) would be indicative of Listeria monocytogenes, which also could be a feasible answer but again, the patient's HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Septate hyphae (choice F) would describe Aspergillus fumigatus, which is another fungal agent of meningitis in the immunocompromised, but it is not the most likely cause."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man develops malaise, fatigue, and anorexia after returning from a trip to Calcutta, India. His symptoms slowly resolve and he does not seek treatment. Three months later laboratory studies of serum show HBsAb Negative, HBeAb Positive, HBcAb Positive, HBeAg Negative, HBsAg Negative. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb is likely indicative of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. The patient has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B",
      "B. The patient is anergic to hepatitis B",
      "C. The patient is immune to hepatitis B",
      "D. The patient is in the window period",
      "E. The patient is making an excess of HBsAb"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has clearly returned from Calcutta with an active infection of hepatitis B, since his serum is positive for antibody against the core antigen of hepatitis B. This is the standard diagnostic for this infection. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb from the serum reflects that the patient has entered the 'window period,' a good prognostic indicator because it demonstrates that antibodies to the surface antigen are being made in enough concentration to precipitate the corresponding antigen out of the circulation. Successful vaccination against hepatitis B (choice A) would be reflected by a positive titer of HBsAb only. The presence of antibody against the e core antigen reflects the existence of an active infection. Anergy to hepatitis B (choice B) is not correct because a person who is anergic is selectively unresponsive or tolerant to the antigen in question. Clearly, the presence of antibodies to several of these viral antigens in the serum demonstrates that this patient is not anergic. Although the patient is beginning to mount a protective immune response (antibody to HBsAg, choice C), it has not yet reached a protective level. If the patient were making an excess of HBsAb (choice E), there would be a rising titer of HBsAb. Thus the patient would be positive for HBsAb and negative for HBsAg."

    "question": "An investigator is conducting a study of resistance of enterococcal species against penicillin and tetracycline. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for the acquisition of this type of multi-drug resistance?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacteriophage",
      "B. Exogenotes",
      "C. Prophage",
      "D. Restriction endonuclease",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Transposons are mobile segments of DNA that can move themselves or a copy of themselves from one molecule of DNA to another. They are found in eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. They need at least one gene coding for a transposase, which are the enzymes involved in this movement. The transposase recognizes a specific nucleotide sequence, and the DNA inserts into this position. This insertion creates direct repeats on each side of the transposon. Transposons include some genes for drug resistance and play an important role in building multiple-drug resistance plasmids. These multi-drug resistance plasmids have played a major role in the explosive spread of drug resistances throughout the bacterial world. Bacteriophages (choice A) are viruses that infect the bacterial cell. Temperate phage DNA may be inserted into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Imported bacterial DNA (i.e., DNA that has been transferred into a cell by conjugation, transformation, or transduction) is on short linear pieces of DNA called exogenotes (choice B). Most linear DNA is not stable in cells because it is broken down by exonucleases. Although technically all transferred DNA involved in emerging drug resistances is of exogenote origin, this is not the best answer because it is not specific enough. A prophage (choice C) is a repressed temperate phage DNA inserted into a bacterial chromosome. The prophage DNA may encode the synthesis of products that make bacteria more pathogenic. This enhanced virulence is called lysogenic conversion. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Restriction endonucleases (choice D) are site-specific endonucleases that recognize specific base sequences and cleave the nucleic acid backbone in the interior of the nucleic acid strand. Although restriction endonucleases are involved in transposon movement, they are not the means by which the drug resistances are acquired."

      "A. Image A",
      "B. Image B",
      "C. Image C",
      "D. Image D",
      "E. Image E"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has a fungus ball, or aspergilloma. These noninvasive or minimally locally invasive lesions are caused by Aspergillus species. They show saprophytic growth in preexisting lung cavities, which may be formed by tuberculosis, tumor, bronchiectasis, or other chronic lung infections. Patients are often asymptomatic but may become allergic to the fungus. Aspergillus fumigatus is a dematiaceous (dark-colored) fungus which forms hyphae that branch at acute angles. Choice A is an image of the arthroconidia of Coccidioides immitis. These are the infectious forms that are found in desert sand. Coccidioides causes San Joaquin Valley fever, which may be an acute or chronic pulmonary condition but is unlikely to invade cavitary lesions of the lung and cause fungus balls. Choice B is an image of the infectious form of Sporothrix schenckii that causes rose-gardener's disease. These are hyphae with sleeves of conidia that would be found in vegetative material in gardens worldwide. Sporothrix causes cutaneous or lymphocutaneous lesions associated with puncture wounds formed while gardening or handling plant material. Choice D is an image of germ tubes (pseudohyphae) formed by Candida albicans when it invades tissues. Candida is an opportunistic pathogen, but it does not cause fungus balls by invading cavitary lesions in the lung. Choice E is an image of the hyphae of the Zygomycophyta (Mucor, Rhizopus or Absidia) which cause rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and cancer patients."

      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Hepadnavirus",
      "C. Herpesvirus",
      "D. Papillomavirus",
      "E. Parvovirus",
      "F. Poxvirus"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Examples of viruses in the Poxvirus family are variola, vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum. All DNA viruses are icosahedral, except for Poxviruses, which are described as brick-shaped complexes. Poxvirus DNA is enveloped. All DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the nucleus, except for Poxvirus, which replicates in the cytoplasm via a virion-associated transcriptase. All of the enzymes and factors necessary for viral replication are then made in the cytoplasm. Adenoviruses (choice A) like the other DNA viruses (except Poxvirus), are icosahedral and have double-stranded linear DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The DNA is not enveloped and there is no virion-associated polymerase. The main example of the Hepadnavirus (choice B) family is the hepatitis B virus. It is icosahedral and contains partially double-stranded circular DNA that is enveloped. Viruses carry a DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity to synthesize an RNA intermediate that is then used to make genomic DNA. Herpesviruses (choice C) consist of herpes simplex, varicella zoster, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus. These are icosahedral and contain enveloped double-stranded linear DNA. The DNA replicates in the nucleus and the virus is assembled in the nucleus. Papillomaviruses (choice D) are icosahedral and contain naked double-stranded circular DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The most important of the Parvoviruses (choice E) is parvovirus B19. It is icosahedral and is the only DNA virus that contains single-stranded DNA, which is naked and replicates in the nucleus."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has the signs and symptoms of a viral encephalitis. During the summer months, most types of viral encephalitis are transmitted by mosquitoes. Examples of arthropod-borne viruses include St. Louis virus, West Nile encephalitis virus (Flaviviridae), and Eastern equine, Western equine, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (Togaviridae). Herpes simplex encephalitis is actually the most common type of encephalitis in the United States, but it is transmitted by direct contact with infected tissues. If this had been a herpes simplex encephalitis, the lumbar puncture would have yielded a high opening pressure and multiple red blood cells would have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Aerosol (choice A) is the mechanism of transmission of most of the respiratory viruses. Fecal-oral transmission (choice C) is the most common means of infection with most gastroenteritis viruses. Most of these viruses are naked capsid viruses which are able to withstand passage through the acidity of the stomach. Parenteral transmission (choice D) is common among the enveloped viruses, which require direct transfusion or transplantation to cause disease. Sexual transmission (choice E) is common among the enveloped viruses, which are extremely fragile in the environment."

      "D. Mycobacterium scrofulaceum",
      "E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Despite the stress placed on the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex in discussions about HIV-infected patients, “ordinary” tuberculosis, caused by M. tuberculosis is the most prevalent form of mycobacterial infection at this point. M. avium-intracellulare complex infections usually do not predominate until the CD4 cell count has fallen well below 100/uL. It is also important to maintain a particularly high index of suspicion in AIDS patients, in whom the chest x-ray may be initially normal, possibly due to an impaired immune response. Some of these cases may clinically (and pathologically) resemble a more conventional bacterial pneumonia, because the body substitutes a comparatively ineffective neutrophil response for the granulomatous response it has trouble mounting. M. avium-intracellulare (choice A) are unusual mycobacterial infections that are noted for causing pulmonary and disseminated infections in AIDS patients, but they are less prevalent than M. tuberculosis except when the CD4+ count is less than 60/uL. M. leprae (choice B) causes leprosy. It is not an infection that is associated with HIV infection in the United States. M. marinum (choice C) can cause fish-tank granuloma (an ulcerating granuloma on the hands of tropical fish enthusiasts) when it enters through cuts in the skin in people who maintain home fish tanks. M. scrofulaceum (choice D) is a scotochromogen (produces carotenoid pigments in the dark) that causes solitary cervical lymphadenopathy in children exposed to contaminated water sources."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The photograph shows a stomach with a perforated peptic ulcer. Perforation of a peptic ulcer is potentially fatal, because of either peritonitis with sepsis or sudden exsanguination (if the perforation damages one of the many arteries of the stomach). Peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, possibly gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma have been strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori colonization of the mucus layer covering the gastric mucosa. The most important pathogenic attribute of H. pylori is its production of urease, which neutralizes the acidic pH of the stomach and allows the organism to invade the mucosal surface. The urease-positive organisms can be remembered with the mnemonic PUNCH: Proteus, Ureaplasma, Nocardia, Cryptococcus, Helicobacter. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with the urease breath test. Campylobacter jejuni (choice A) is also a gram-negative curved rod but is not associated with the formation of gastric ulcers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, anaerobic rod that is associated with gangrene and a mild form of food poisoning. Escherichia coli (choice C) is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod associated with many forms of gastroenteritis but not with gastric ulcer formation.

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Composite viruses are viruses that are created in laboratories by artificially combining components of different parental viruses. In this case, the genetic material is DNA because the molluscum contagiosum virus is a double-stranded DNA virus in the poxvirus family. Thus the progeny viruses will have a double-stranded DNA genome. Double-stranded RNA, segmented (choice B) would be the genome of reoviruses, and neither poxviruses nor poliovirus have this form of genome. Negative-stranded RNA viruses (choice C) is the genome of many viruses including rabies and orthomyxoviruses, but neither is present in this composite virus.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has symptoms and signs of a fungal cerebrospinal infection. The most common cause of meningitis in AIDS patients in the United States is Cryptococcus neoformans, which is an encapsulated, monomorphic yeast acquired from exposure to pigeon droppings. Although the USMLE likes to mention the India ink test of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in vignettes to avoid having to give away the diagnosis, India ink is not the preferred diagnostic test. The more sensitive test that is used in most hospital situations is latex particle agglutination to detect capsular antigens shed into the CSF. India ink (choice A), a test to diagnose cryptococcal infections, depends on the precipitation of a particulate dye around the capsular material of the organism. It misses about 50% of all infections. Molecular probes (choice C) are used in many diagnoses, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a variety of virus infections. It is not used for cryptococcal meningitis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (choice D) is used to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in infants. This assay detects integrated HIV (provirus). PCRs are available for other virus infections but are not used to diagnose cryptococcosis. Tzanck smear (choice E) is used to diagnose herpesvirus infections. It involves touching a slide or coverslip to a lesion to lift off the multinucleated giant cells caused by the infection."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman who recently emigrated from Southeast Asia comes io the emergency department because of severe right upper quadrant pain. An ultrasound of the gallbladder shows high echogenicity and she undergoes a cholecystectomy Examination of the gallbladder shows a large number of dark-colored, faceted stones with irregular shapes. Infection with which of the following organisms is most likely associated with this type of stone?",
    "options": [
      "A. Clonorchis sinensis",
      "B. Fasciolopsis buski",
      "C. Paragonimus westermani",
      "D. Schistosoma haematobium",
      "E. Taenia saginata"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The stones described are pigment stones, composed of relatively pure calcium bilirubinate. These stones are less common than cholesterol stones. Risk factors for pigment stones include hepatic cirrhosis (unclear mechanism), hemolytic anemias, and liver fluke infection, notably by the Oriental liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Fasciolopsis buski (choice B) is a large intestinal fluke that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal mucosal abscesses. Fasciola spp., not Fasciolopsis, are other liver flukes besides Clonorchis. Paragonimus westermani (choice C) is a lung fluke that can cause cough, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis. Schistosoma haematobium (choice D) is a blood fluke that tends to infect pelvic veins and may cause bladder disease (including cancer). Taenia saginata (choice E) is the beef tapeworm, and may cause intestinal obstruction."

Treatment with morphine is begun and the girl's symptoms are partially relieved. Physical examination shows a raised facial rash. A peripheral blood smear shows severe anemia, and a bone-marrow aspirate shows no erythroid precursor cells. Infection with which of the following is most likely responsible for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Coxsackie virus",
      "B. Echovirus",
      "C. Hepadnavirus",
      "D. Herpesvirus",
      "E. Parvovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses, of which only serotype B19 is pathogenic for humans. This virus causes three distinct syndromes: a childhood febrile rash known as erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), aplastic crisis in individuals with chronic hemolytic diseases (sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia, etc.), and congenital infections that can present as stillbirth, hydrops fetalis (analogous to severe Rh incompatibility), or severe anemia. Coxsackie viruses (choice A) usually cause coldlike illness, but can cause herpangina, myocarditis, and meningitis. Echoviruses (choice B) can infect a variety of organ systems (gastrointestinal, central nervous system, eyes, heart, respiratory, skin), but are not a cause of aplastic crises. Hepadnavirus (choice C) is the causative agent of hepatitis B. Herpesviruses (choice D) cause a variety of acute to chronic infections, including herpes simplex types 1 and 2, chickenpox, chronic herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus infection, and Epstein-Barr virus infections."

    "question": "A stable clone of bacteria that is susceptible to tetracycline is placed in culture with 10 bacteria that are resistant to tetracycline. Within 24 hours, all the bacteria in the culture are tetracycline-resistant. The genetic process by which this occurred is shown Which of the following best describes this process?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Homologous recombination",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The diagram shows the process of conjugation between an F+ donor and an F- recipient bacterium. This process transfers plasmids in their entirety from the donor to the recipient. The traits that will be transferred in this way are those encoded in the plasmid and all recipients will become donors in the process. Generalized transduction (choice B) can be accomplished by both lytic and temperative phage only during the lytic cycle. The process involves the phage mistakenly packaging bacterial DNA into the capsid and transferring the DNA to another bacterial cell. In this type of transduction any gene can be transferred. Homologous recombination (choice C) is not a mechanism of genetic transfer for bacteria but a mechanism by which bacterial nucleic acid is stabilized following transfer. Transformation, transduction, and Hfr conjugation are all followed by homologous recombination requiring recombinase A. Specialized transduction (choice D) can only be accomplished by a temperate phage in which there is an excision error during induction of the phage from the bacterial chromosome. In this case, bacterial nucleic acid is mistakenly excised along with phage DNA. Only certain genes (located next to the phage insertion sites) have an opportunity to be transferred. Transformation (choice E) is the uptake of naked DNA by certain 'competent' bacterial cells."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman develops a dry cough, fever, headache, and muscular pains. She has been treated unsuccessfully for the past 1 week with aspirin and ampicillin. Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath and worsening cough. An x-ray of the chest shows scattered interstitial opacities. Treatment with erythromycin is begun and her symptoms rapidly improve. Which of the following findings is most likely associated with the causal organism of patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cold agglutinins",
      "B. Dieterle silver staining",
      "C. Quellung reaction",
      "D. Requirement for cysteine",
      "E. Requirement for factors X and V"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient's clinical presentation is typical of primary atypical pneumonia. This type of pneumonia is typically caused by intracellular organisms such as viruses, or Chlamydiae, but since Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall, it does not elicit the characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate caused by most other bacteria. Because the patient's infection responded to erythromycin, it cannot have been caused by a virus; so the most likely causative agent is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A finding in about 65% of Mycoplasma patients is the production of cold agglutinins: IgM isohemagglutinins that will agglutinate autologous erythrocytes at 4°C (39.2°F). The Dieterle silver stain (choice B) is used to identify Legionella pneumophila, which is an agent of atypical pneumonia of the elderly but would be more likely in a smoker or immunosuppressed patient. Legionella would respond to erythromycin, but this patient is not immunocompromised. The Quellung reaction (choice C) is a technique used to identify the capsular serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium is the most common cause of adult typical pneumonia and would not cause the interstitial presentation described here. Requirement for cysteine (choice D) is a characteristic of four genera of bacteria: Francisella, Legionella, Brucella, and Pasteurella. Although Francisella, Legionella, and Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens that could cause atypical pneumonia, they would not be expected in this patient. Francisella is acquired from ticks or from handling infected reservoir animals. Brucella is acquired from contaminated dairy products or contact with animals. Legionella is a disease of elderly smokers who are immunosuppressed. Pasteurella is found in the mouths of many animals and is transmitted most commonly from cat bites. Requirement for factors X and V (choice E) is characteristic of Haemophilus. Haemophilus is an extracellular bacterium that causes otitis media, epiglottitis, pharyngitis and meningitis in unvaccinated children who are between 3 months and 2 years of age. It would not be expected in the present patient's age group."

    "options": [
      "A. 2-to-5-μm yeast with a thin cell wall but no true capsule",
      "B. 4-to-10-μm yeast with a broad, slimy capsule",
      "C. 10-to-60-μm yeast with multiple budding",
      "D. 20-to-50-μm nonbudding spherule filled with endospores",
      "E. Hyphae branching dichotomously at acute angles"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. A variety of fungi can produce acute or chronic lung disease like that described in this case history. They are distinguished by geographic incidence and examination of the sputum or biopsy. Histoplasma capsulatum which causes histoplasmosis, is observed most frequently in the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri river valleys of the United States (Central U.S.). The organism is a small (2-to-5-μm) intracellular yeast which, despite the name, has no true capsule. Calcifying lesions forming in the lungs are very suggestive of fungal infection. Blastomyces dermatitidis could cause similar presentation in this area, but it would be found in the sputum as a broad-based budding yeast, and that option is not available within the choices. Choice B describes Cryptococcus which is the most common cause of fungal meningitis in immunosuppressed patients notably those with AIDS or hematopoietic disorders. Choice C describes Paracoccidioides which can cause pulmonary disease in patients from South and Central America. Choice D describes Coccidioides, which can cause skin lesions or pulmonary disease in the desert southwest and far west of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever). Choice E describes Aspergillus an opportunistic fungus that can invade cavitary lesions in the lung and cause aspergilloma, or fungus ball."

He says that he felt well until 4 days ago, but now has a headache and has been vomiting. His temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). Physical examination shows no rash, ulceration, or petechiae Laboratory studies show an absolute leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased serum transaminases. A peripheral blood smear shows granulocytes that contain berry-like clusters of intracellular organisms. The vector for the causative agent of his illness is the same as that for which of the following organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "B. Francisella tularensis",
      "C. Plasmodium vivax",
      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has granulocytic ehrlichiosis, caused by Ehrlichia phagocytophila. This intracellular bacterium is transmitted by the Ixodes tick, which also transmits Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. The disease presents similarly to Rocky Mountain spotted fever but does not have a rash. The pathognomonic feature in this case history is the presence of morulae (berry-like clusters of organisms) inside the patient's granulocytes. Francisella tularensis (choice B) can be transmitted in a number of different ways, but when an arthropod is implicated, it is the Dermacentor tick. This is the same tick that transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Tularemia is an ulceroglandular disease with fever, ulcer at the bite site, and lymph node enlargement. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of most of the encephalitis viruses, all species of malaria parasites, dengue yellow fever, and filariasis. This patient clearly does not have encephalitis, and malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and filariasis would not be expected in a 16-year-old boy in the continental United States. Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) is the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and is transmitted by the Dermacentor tick. Rocky Mountain spotted fever has a characteristic rash that begins on the ankles and wrists progressing toward the trunk. The Weil-Felix test, which is a nonspecific test for antibodies that agglutinate Proteus organisms, would be positive. This tick also transmits Francisella tularensis but the symptoms of this patient are not consistent with either tularemia (an ulceroglandular disease) or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (choice E) is the agent of scrub typhus. It is transmitted by mites in the genus Leptotrombidium. Rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari) is also transmitted in this fashion, but both of these diseases are rare in the United States and would be characterized by rash and Weil-Felix test positivity."

    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a seizure. His mother says that he developed a fever, a severe prefrontal headache, and an altered sense of smell ten days after swimming in a lake near his camp. Physical examination shows a profuse green discharge from the nose. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 100 neutrophils, 50 lymphocytes, 30 mg/dL glucose, and 60 mg/dL protein. He dies two days after admission despite aggressive therapy Which of the following is most likely to be found on microscopic examination of the central nervous system at autopsy?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci",
      "B. Gram-positive, catalase-negative diplococci",
      "C. Motile flagellated trophozoites",
      "D. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies",
      "E. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles",
      "F. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has acquired primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri. This organism is a free-living ameba that is found in warm freshwater lakes. During the act of diving into such lakes, changes in pressure can force the organism through the cribriform plate and result in the production of necrotic lesions spreading from the olfactory lobes. The form of the organism that is found in human tissue is a flagellated trophozoite. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. This is a common cause of meningitis in young adults, but the case history would have to describe the presence of petechial hemorrhages from endotoxin toxicity. N. meningitidis overproduces outer membrane fragments and thus produces very early signs of endotoxin shock compared to other gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive catalase-negative diplococci (choice B) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although this is the most common cause of typical pneumonia, meningitis and sinusitis in the United States, it is not associated with swimming or diving, and the CSF would have shown extremely high numbers of neutrophils, low glucose, and high protein. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice D) describes cells infected with herpes simplex virus. This is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. It is not associated with swimming or diving. Although the CSF cell, protein, and glucose values could have indicated a viral etiology, herpes simplex encephalitis is also associated with a high opening pressure and the presence of many red blood cells. Encephalitis is also generally associated with confusion or change in mental status. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles (choice E) describes the zygomycophyta: bread mold fungi in the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, and Mucor. These agents can cause fatal rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and adults with cancer. The symptoms would be quite similar to those described in this case history, but these are opportunistic pathogens that do not cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts (choice F) describes Cryptococcus neoformans. This monomorphic fungus is the principal cause of meningitis in patients with Hodgkin disease or AIDS."

One hour later, he develops progressive respiratory distress and supplemental oxygen is provided. He has a history of intravenous drug abuse, His CD4 cell count is 73/uL. Which of the following tests will be most helpful in confirming the identity of the most likely causal agent of his fever and respiratory symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. CD4 cell count",
      "B. Direct fluorescent antibody test",
      "C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Western blot"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The most common atypical pneumonia in AIDS is caused by the atypical fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii). Patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia have great difficulty producing sputum, so bronchial lavage or transmural biopsy are generally required. The sample is then submitted to the direct fluorescent antibody test or stained with Gomori methenamine silver stain to visualize the organisms. The direct fluorescent antibody test is a technique to demonstrate the presence of antigen from a pathogen in a patient. Antigen-detecting tests will remain useful throughout the life of an AIDS patient because they do not depend on detection of the patient's immune response to the pathogen (which may be absent at the end of AIDS). When stained with methenamine silver, Pneumocystis cysts have a characteristic cup or boat shape; the individual cells are difficult to demonstrate without electron microscopy. CD4 cell count (choice A) is used to measure the progression of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since the virus infects and destroys these cells, the number remaining in the circulation becomes a good predictor of the progression of disease. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (choice C) is used as the screening test to diagnose HIV infection. It is a serologic test (i.e., identifies antibodies against the virus) and once the patient progresses into full-blown AIDS, antibody levels other than IgM will decline, so in general, serologic tests in late HIV infection tend to be less useful than tests that detect antigens from a pathogen. Polymerase chain reaction (choice D) is used to detect the viral load of the HIV virus in infected patients and infants. Western blot (choice E) is the confirmatory serologic test that is used in the diagnosis of HIV infection."

    "options": [
      "A. Cell wall",
      "B. Cytoplasmic membrane",
      "C. Flagella",
      "D. Outer surface protein",
      "E. Periplasmic space"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This woman has developed a positive tuberculin skin test indicating exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The molecule injected into the skin of the forearm to elicit this response is a purified protein derivative (PPD), which is composed of tuberculin (an outer surface protein) and mycolic acids of the organism. This is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction requiring sensitized TH1 cells. Only proteins can evoke such responses, since T cells are only capable of recognizing peptides presented to them in the context of an MHC molecule. The cell wall (choice A) of mycobacteria contains a thinner-than-normal layer of peptidoglycan and mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids. However, this material is not proteinaceous and therefore does not stimulate the TH1 cells necessary for the formation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The cytoplasmic membrane (choice B) of mycobacteria is a phospholipid bilayer that is similar to the inner membranes of all other prokaryotes and does not contribute to the specific skin test for tuberculosis. Flagella (choice C) are not present on M. tuberculosis because the organism is not motile. M. tuberculosis does not possess a periplasmic space (choice E) because it is an organism that is taxonomically related to the gram-positives. Only gram-negative bacteria possess a periplasmic space."

An electroencephalogram shows diffuse slowing over both cerebral hemispheres. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the brain shows demyelination with abnormal giant oligodendrocytes, some of which contain eosinophilic inclusions. This patient's condition occurs most commonly in association with which of the following diseases?",
    "options": [
      "A. AIDS",
      "B. Chickenpox",
      "C. Measles",
      "D. Multiple sclerosis",
      "E. Rabies",
      "F. Syphilis",
      "G. Tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rapidly progressive demyelinating disorder in which the JC virus (a polyomavirus) infects oligodendroglial cells in the brain. The eosinophilic inclusions represent accumulations of JC virus. PML occurs in about 1% of AIDS patients, and is the AIDS-defining illness in half of the patients who develop the condition. Symptoms include aphasia, hemiparesis, cortical blindness, ataxia, and conjugate gaze abnormalities. The condition can progress to quadriparesis and coma. There is no effective treatment for this disorder. Shingles and postinfectious encephalitis can follow chickenpox (choice B) but varicella is not specifically associated with demyelination. Measles (choice C) can cause an encephalitis and, in some cases, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) may follow previous measles infection. These disorders would affect not only white matter but gray matter as well. Also, SSPE usually occurs before the age of 18. Multiple sclerosis (choice D) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease characterized by demyelination. The immunologic basis of the pathology appears to be that TH1 lymphocytes reactive against myelin stimulate macrophages to destroy the myelin. It is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity response. Women are affected twice as often as men. The disease tends to have a relapsing and remitting course and may involve visual impairment, cranial nerve signs, ataxia, nystagmus, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Spinal cord lesions give rise to motor and sensory difficulties of the trunk and limbs, and spasticity and loss of control of bladder function. Rabies (choice E) produces eosinophilic inclusions (Negri bodies) in the brain but these are found in the gray matter. Signs of rabies would include excessive salivation, hallucinations, and hydrophobia. Syphilis (choice F) can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord damage, but the disease process would not be limited to the white matter. Tuberculosis (choice G) can cause a granulomatous meningitis, typically affecting the base of the brain."

      "B. Cold temperature",
      "C. Egg-yolk cholesterol",
      "D. Reduced oxygen tension",
      "E. Staphylococcus aureus on blood agar"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The patient is suffering from conjunctivitis caused by Haemophilus, a fastidious organism requiring factors V (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and X (hematin), which must be released from whole-blood preparations to be accessible to the organism. This can be done by gentle heating, which lyses the red blood cells, or by co-culture with Staphylococcus aureus, which is beta-hemolytic and lyses the red blood cells to provide the factors Haemophilus needs for growth. This is called the satellite phenomenon. Antibiotics (choice A) would not be necessary since, with proper culture techniques, no normal flora should be available to confuse the diagnosis of conjunctivitis. Antibiotics and antifungals are added to chocolate agar to create Thayer-Martin medium to prevent the growth of normal flora when culturing from the genital tract. Cold temperature (choice B) would not be necessary because Haemophilus grows at normal body temperature. Listeria is the genus commonly mentioned for which a cold temperature is necessary. Cholesterol (choice C) is necessary for the growth of Mycoplasma but not Haemophilus. Low oxygen tension (choice D) is necessary for the growth of the microaerophiles (such as Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Borrelia), but is not a condition for growth of Haemophilus."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This woman has developed a pulmonary abscess, as evidenced by the chest radiograph. Of the organisms listed, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely cause of bacterial pneumonia complicated by abscess formation. Bacteria that commonly produce pneumonia that develops in the context of influenza include Staph. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of these, Staph. aureus is most destructive to lung tissue and likely to cause cavitary lesions. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus (choice A) describes Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium would be a cause of pneumonia in alcoholic or diabetic patients, or in those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A gram-positive catalase-negative alpha-hemolytic diplococcus (choice B) describes Strep. pneumoniae. This agent causes a necrotizing abscessing pneumonia with appearance similar to that of Staph. aureus, but it rarely causes cavitary lesions. A silver-staining cyst (choice D) describes Pneumocystis jiroveci. This agent is associated with atypical pneumonia in the immunocompromised or in premature infants.

Fever, malaise, headache, and myalgia may also be present, particularly in the prodromal phase. Tzanck smear of the base of a vesicle may demonstrate multinucleated giant cells. Immunocompromised patients can be treated with acyclovir to prevent dissemination. Chickenpox may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, systemic spread (immunosuppressed patients), neurologic involvement (rare), Reye syndrome (rare), and/or hemolytic anemia (rare). Genital vesicles and ulcers (choice A) are associated with herpes simplex type 2. Infectious mononucleosis (choice B) is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus.

The clinical features include sore throat, headache, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, hepatosplenomegaly, periorbital edema, rash, and a palatal enanthem. The diagnosis is made by heterophile antibody testing (monospot), EBV antibody titers, and the finding of lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. Treatment includes rest, fluids, and analgesics. Treatment with penicillin derivatives (ampicillin) leads to a maculopapular rash. Chest x-ray (choice A) is useful for a respiratory or cardiac process. Infectious mononucleosis cannot be diagnosed by any radiographic study. ELISA (choice B) would be a useful screening test for a variety of infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A lateral x-ray of the neck (choice D) is useful in acute epiglottitis; it would show epiglottic swelling. The symptoms of epiglottitis include extreme sore throat, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. A rapid antigen test (choice E) is used to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is characterized by fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A scarlatiniform rash may follow the pharyngitis. The rash, a diffuse erythema that later desquamates, is caused by an erythrotoxin. Antibodies to the varicella virus (choice F) can be detected by immunofluorescence. The symptoms of varicella include a vesicular rash (in various stages of evolution), fever, and malaise. The treatment is bathing soaks and antipruritic topical medication. Treatment with aspirin has been associated with Reye syndrome and should therefore be avoided."

    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a fever, nausea, diarrhea, and a rash. Her last menstrual period began 3 days ago. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a diffuse erythematous rash with areas of desquamation over the hands and feet. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, nonfermenting, nonmotile, non-H₂S-producing bacillus",
      "B. Gram-positive anaerobic rod",
      "C. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus",
      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus",
      "E. Single-stranded diploid RNA virus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a multisystem syndrome caused by a toxin (TSST-1) formed by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. TSS usually affects several organ systems (gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary) and can result in death. TSS has historically been associated with the use of tampons in young women, but can also occur in other patient populations. Fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and diffuse rash with desquamation of the hands and feet are common symptoms. Management of shock, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a priority if these conditions are present, in addition to appropriate antibacterial treatment. S. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting, nonmotile, non-H₂S-producing bacillus (choice A) describes the genus Shigella, which causes dysentery, characterized by fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea. A gram-positive anaerobic rod (choice B) describes Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene with necrosis of soft tissues, usually after a traumatic wound. It is also a cause of food poisoning. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus (choice D) describes Staph. epidermidis, which is part of the normal skin flora but is notorious for causing infections of intravenous lines and prosthetic heart valves. A single-stranded diploid RNA virus (choice E) describes the retroviruses. Although HIV-1 can cause many diverse findings and should never be immediately ruled out, the findings in the present patient are most specific for TSS."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of fever, myalgias, and cough He owns an automobile repair shop and recently cleaned his garage, which was infested with mice. He is tachypneic and must use accessory respiratory muscles to breathe. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. California encephalitis",
      "B. Cytomegalovirus",
      "C. Hantavirus",
      "D. Plague",
      "E. Poliovirus",
      "F. Rabies",
      "G. Tularemia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, first reported in 1993, consists of fever, myalgia, and rapid development of respiratory failure leading to death. The initial cases were mostly among Navajo Indians, however, cases have been documented in many U.S. states and in Canada. It is most common in the U.S. Four Corners states: New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. The causative agent is a hantavirus belonging to the family Bunyaviridae. The virus has also been called the Sin Nombre (Spanish for 'without a name') virus. Infection is thought to be through inhalation of aerosolized secretions from the common deer mouse. The disease typically begins with a nonspecific prodrome (fever, generalized myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances) followed 4 to 5 days later by respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea). This progresses rapidly to an adult respiratory distress syndrome and, in many cases, death. California encephalitis (choice A) is caused by an arbovirus transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Most cases are in children younger than 10 years of age. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Myalgias and arthralgias are typically present. Seizure activity is most frequently observed in infants and young children. Most cases are in the midwestern United States. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (choice B) is a Herpesvirus that produces a variety of infections. Primary CMV infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients, but can cause a heterophile-negative mononucleosis syndrome. Perinatal infections can occur in utero, intrapartum, or postpartum, and can produce congenital malformations. CMV can be transmitted by leukocytes in blood transfusions. In patients with AIDS or other immunosuppressive states, CMV can produce severe disease, including retinitis, pneumonia, encephalitis, adrenalitis, and gastrointestinal tract ulcerations. Plague (choice D) is caused by Yersinia pestis. It is endemic in the desert southwest of the United States, but plague normally begins with an extremely high fever, conjunctivitis, and septicemia. If it is acquired by fleabite, then buboes (hemorrhagic lymph nodes) will be found; if it is acquired in the pneumonic form, then cough will be observed. Poliovirus (choice E) is a member of the Picornavirus family. It remains epidemic in parts of Asia and Africa even though the wild type has been eliminated from the western hemisphere. The virus affects cranial nerve nuclei and anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, producing a flaccid paralysis that is usually asymmetric. Vaccine-related polio can occur with the live virus vaccine. Rabies (choice F) is a Rhabdovirus that produces encephalitis and/or myelitis. It should be considered in persons who have recently traveled outside of the United States. The most common sources of exposure are dogs, cats, skunks, foxes, raccoons (in Florida and Connecticut), wolves, and bats. The infection is acquired from the bite of a rabid animal or by inhalation. Rabies also has been reported to occur in patients after corneal transplantation. The virus spreads along peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. Symptoms include hallucinations, hydrophobia and copious salivation. Tularemia (choice G) is caused by Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative, cysteine-requiring facultative intracellular bacillus. The disease is most common in Arkansas and Missouri, and is acquired by handling, ingesting, or inhaling material from infected reservoir animals such as deer, rabbits and small rodents. It may also be transmitted by ticks from one of the reservoir animals to humans. Tularemia is generally characterized by disseminated granulomatous lesions, and would not be expected to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome."

    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of a headache and a high fever. He recently returned from a 2-week trip to Europe where he went diving in several natural pools. A diagnosis of meningoencephalitis localized to the base of his brain is made. A photomicrograph of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is shown. Through which of the following structures did the causal organism most likely gain access to the brain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cavernous sinus",
      "B. Cribriform plate",
      "C. Lacrimal bone",
      "D. Mandible",
      "E. Nasal bone",
      "F. Zygomatic bone"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The rare but life-threatening meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri apparently ensues when the organism enters the body through the nasal mucosa and crosses the cribriform plate to enter the brain via the olfactory nerves. It has been speculated that changes in pressure created during diving predispose to this infection. The cavernous sinus (choice A) is the site of entry of the zygomycophyta (Rhizopus, Mucor or Absidia) into the brain in diabetic ketoacidotic patients or adults with cancer. The lacrimal bone (choice C) of the medial aspect of the orbit does not appear to be involved in amebic infection. The mouth and its associated bones, including the mandible (choice D), do not appear to be routes of infection for this organism. The nasal bones (choice E) located on the superior surface of the nose, do not appear to be a route of infection for this organism. The zygomatic bone (choice F) which forms the cheekbone, does not appear to be a route of infection for this organism."

Serology for hepatitis viruses is performed and shows the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM antibody Antibody tests for HBsAb and HAV are negative. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these results?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute HBV infection",
      "B. A dual infection of HBV and HAV",
      "C. Chronic hepatitis B infection",
      "D. Immunity to hepatitis B virus",
      "E. Past hepatitis A infection"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) along with hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM Ab), and the absence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), indicate the early stages of an acute infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). A dual infection of HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (choice B) is not plausible since the IgM anti-HAV serology is negative. Chronic HBV infection (choice C) is unlikely because the patient has HBc IgM Ab, which is characteristic of an acute infection rather than a chronic infection. Immunity to HBV (choice D) is not plausible due to the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM Ab and the lack of HBsAb. Past hepatitis A infection (choice E) would be manifested by the presence of IgG antibodies against HAV."

      "C. Rheumatic fever",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has acute infective endocarditis. The most common cause of acute bacterial endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus. This type of endocarditis is typically acquired by illicit intravenous drug use, which can introduce skin organisms into the venous system that then attack the tricuspid valve. Staph. aureus accounts for between 60 and 90% of cases of endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Damage to the tricuspid valve is common. The endocarditis associated with congenital heart disease (choice B) typically involves either damaged valves or atrial or ventricular septal defects. The tricuspid valve is not particularly vulnerable. Rheumatic fever (choice C) most commonly damages the mitral and aortic valves, and tricuspid damage is usually less severe and seen only when the mitral and aortic valves are heavily involved. Rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) is not associated with bacterial endocarditis. Systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) can produce small, aseptic vegetations on the ventricular and atrial surfaces of the mitral valve (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)."

      "C. Non-pilus adhesins",
      "D. Pili",
      "E. Pneumolysin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common causes of otitis media in children are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In a vignette that gives no Gram stain or culture characteristics, the answer should refer to the number one cause, in this case Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most important virulence factor in Strep. pneumoniae is the capsule, which protects against phagocytosis. Lipopolysaccharide (choice B) is present in all gram-negative bacteria and would not be found in Strep. pneumoniae which is gram-positive. Non-pilus adhesins (choice C) exist in many organisms, and mediate adherence to the epithelial surfaces. For example, hemagglutinin molecules of bacteria and viruses fit this definition, and some toxins like the pertussis toxin have adhesive abilities. Pili (choice D) are glycoprotein “hairs” which mediate attachment to the epithelium. In gram-positives such as this one they are referred to as fimbriae and in gram-negatives they are extremely important virulence factors in allowing colonization of the uroepithelium by Escherichia coli, for example. Pneumolysin (choice E) is a cytotoxin produced by Strep. pneumoniae which destroys ciliated epithelial cells."

      "A. Flea",
      "B. Louse",
      "C. Mosquito",
      "D. Reduviid bug",
      "E. Tick"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has myocarditis due to Trypanosoma cruzi. This infectious condition, known as Chagas disease, is endemic in vast areas of South America and is transmitted from person to person by the reduviid bug, also known as the 'kissing bug'. Experts assess the number of persons with Chagas disease at about 7 million, with about 35 million at risk in South America. T. cruzi is an intracellular protozoan that localizes mainly in the heart and nerve cells of the myenteric plexus, leading to myocarditis and dysmotility of hollow organs, such as the esophagus, colon, and ureter. Cardiac involvement manifests with ventricular dilatation and congestive heart failure secondary to myocyte necrosis and fibrosis. Intracellular parasites can be visualized in tissue sections. Chagas disease is a cause of acquired achalasia, in which the distal third of the esophagus dilates because of loss of its intrinsic innervation. A similar pathologic mechanism accounts for megacolon and megaureter in Chagas disease. The flea (choice A) is the vector for Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. The louse (choice B) is the vector for Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus. The mosquito (choice C) is the vector for many of the Arboviruses that cause encephalitis. West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis are examples. Ticks (choice E) are the vectors for Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia, Rickettsia rickettsii, for example."

    "question": "A strain of Escherichia coli is resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, ampicillin, kanamycin, and neomycin Another strain of the same bacteria is not resistant to any of these drugs. When 100 bacteria from the resistant strain are added to a flask of bacteria of the sensitive strain and incubated overnight, all the bacteria in the flask develop resistance to the full complement of antibiotics Which of the following best explains these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation",
      "B. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction",
      "C. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction",
      "D. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation",
      "E. Transfer of multiple drug-resistance plasmids via conjugation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli are well known for their ability to transfer multiple-drug resistances during a single conjugative event. When these resistance genes become accumulated on a plasmid capable of mediating conjugation (a fertility factor), all drug-resistance genes are transferred efficiently and swiftly to the other partner of conjugation. Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation (choice A) would not be likely to have the same level of efficiency as that described in the question stem. Although the Hfr cell transfers some DNA via conjugation, it transfers chromosomal DNA, not plasmid DNA. Because the chromosome is so much larger, the exchange is never complete, and only some genes can be successfully transferred in each conjugative event. Because all the sensitive bacteria in this experiment acquired all the drug-resistance genes, it is unlikely that these were all chromosomal genes. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction (choice B) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Generalized transduction is the mechanism by which a lytic phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction (choice C) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Specialized transduction is the mechanism by which a temperate phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation (choice D) requires the uptake of free DNA from the environment by competent cells. It is not likely that such a large amount of DNA could be transferred in this way with 100% efficiency."

      "B. Both hyphae and spores",
      "C. Cannot make ATP",
      "D. No true cell wall",
      "E. Visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Having both hyphae and spores (choice B) would be true of Candida, which usually causes arthritis as a rare complication of systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma do not have true cell walls (choice D) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete that is visible only with darkfield microscopy (choice E) or direct fluorescent antibody. Secondary syphilis can (uncommonly) cause an acute arthritis, but syphilis is rare in an otherwise healthy adult."

    "options": [
      "A. catalase",
      "B. Hemolysin",
      "C. Hyaluronidase",
      "D. streptokinase",
      "E. Tetanospasmin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome. Tetanospasmin (choice E) is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It inhibits the inhibitory mediators glycine and GABA, and promotes the rigid paralysis of tetanus. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome."

    "options": [
      "A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "E. Streptococcus salivarius"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx; constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx and a tonsillar exudate. Streptococcus salivarius (choice E) is a gram-positive coccus that is usually alpha-hemolytic. It is normal flora of the oral cavity and is sometimes implicated in subacute bacterial endocarditis, but is not associated with tonsillar abscesses."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Streptococcus bovis is a group D Streptococcus. There is a significant association between S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon and other colonic diseases. Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are reported to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. The group D Streptococci are distinguished by having a cell wall carbohydrate composed of glycerol teichoic acid. S. agalactiae (choice A) is a group B Streptococcus that is the number-one cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia in the United States. S. mutans and S. sanguis (choices C and F) are viridans streptococci, which are normal flora of the oral mucosa.

      "E. Virus, p24, RNA Undetectable | CD4+ Normal | Anti-p24 Decreasing | Anti-env Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 525/mm³, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient, measured by RT-PCR for viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Antibodies against the envelope glycoproteins are generally IgM, which does not require a primary immune response. The IgM anti-env antibody can be made in the absence of TH cells. Increasing p24 virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood. This does not happen in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy."

This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells. It has sterols in its membrane (choice A) is a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These are the only prokaryotes that totally lack a cell wall, but instead have sterols in their membranes. It lacks a cell wall (choice B) is also a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These prokaryotes are devoid of a cell wall but have sterols in their membranes. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol (choice C) is a statement that describes the fungi. The ergosterol molecule is unique to fungi and is the target molecule for nystatin and the imidazoles. A cell wall containing mycolic acids (choice D) describes the genus Mycobacterium. Mycolic acids are long-chain fatty acids that give this group its resistance to environmental stresses and its acid-fast staining characteristics."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of recurrent growth of a whitish film on his tongue and buccal mucosa. There is no evidence of esophageal involvement. A scraping of the lesion is placed in a test tube containing animal serum and the results of this evaluation are shown in the photomicrograph. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug of choice for this patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. It blocks ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase",
      "B. It inhibits the CYP450—dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase",
      "C. It inhibits the synthesis of beta-glucan",
      "D. It interferes with mitotic spindle function",
      "E. It interferes with thymidylate synthetase and DNA synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test, the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the “conazole” antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A). This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patients oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum. Flucytosine interferes with thymidylate synthetase (choice E). This agent is used in the treatment of cryptococcosis. It is contraindicated in HIV patients, as it may cause bone marrow suppression in those patients."

    "question": "A medical virology laboratory coinfects cells in a tissue culture flask with influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1). The flask is incubated for 48 hours and the progeny viruses are analyzed. Four distinct variants of influenza A are isolated: H3N2, H1N1, H3N1, and H1N2 Which of the following viral attributes most likely made the production of H3N1 and H1N2 variants possible?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. High mutational rate",
      "C. Phenotypic mixing",
      "D. segmented genome",
      "E. Syncytia formation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

      "A. Ecthyma gangrenosum",
      "B. Erythema migrans",
      "C. Food poisoning",
      "D. Nonmycotic mycetoma",
      "E. Pharyngitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes malignant otitis externa which is a severe necrotizing infection of the external ear canal. Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone, temporal bone, sigmoid sinus, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Patients at increased risk include the elderly, people with diabetes, and the immunocompromised. Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes (since the organism can be cultured from the shoes), burn infections, and pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients. Ecthyma gangrenosum is the name of the characteristic lesion that occurs during Pseudomonas septicemias. It has a black, necrotic center and a raised hemorrhagic ring outside. Erythema migrans (choice B) is the target-shaped rash that occurs in the early stages of Lyme disease. Food poisoning (choice C) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas. Nonmycotic mycetoma (choice D) is caused by Actinomyces and Nocardia. Pharyngitis (choice E) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas."

      "D. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus",
      "E. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, naked, icosahedral virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Outbreaks occur seasonally in winter and early spring. Infection does not result in lasting immunity, and reinfection can occur. The virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, a group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are nonsegmented, helical, and enveloped. Double-stranded DNA, naked, icosahedral virus (choice A) describes the Adenoviruses, which are capable of causing conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. However, these agents are not common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Negative-sense single-stranded RNA with eight segments, helical, enveloped virus (choice C) describes the Orthomyxoviruses, which include influenza virus. Influenza is a systemic illness characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache myalgias, malaise, and prostration, followed by cough, nasal obstruction, and sore throat. The lower respiratory tract may also be involved. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus (choice D) describes the Coronaviruses, which cause the common cold (nasal obstruction and discharge, sneezing, mild or no fever, occasional sore throat, and/or cough) and acute pharyngitis (sore throat with or without cervical adenopathy, ulceration, and conjunctivitis). SARS-CoV also belongs to this family and causes a seasonal acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is usually imported into this hemisphere from the Far East. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA naked, icosahedral virus (choice E) describes the Picornaviruses and Caliciviruses. Within the Picornaviridae, rhinoviruses cause the common cold but would not be common agents of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants."

    "options": [
      "A. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes",
      "B. Introns",
      "C. Points of bacteriophage insertion",
      "D. Points of site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. A resistance transfer factor is a bacterial plasmid that encodes one or more drug-resistance genes and has the capability of mediating its own transfer to another bacterium during conjugation (it possesses the F operon). Most of the known resistance transfer factors have been formed by the accumulation of transposons into fertility factor plasmids. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are capable of movement within bacterial cells. When they carry drug-resistance genes and accumulate in plasmids that already possess the F operon, multiple drug-resistant plasmids (resistance transfer factors) are formed. The flanking sequences in the DNA of a transposon are indirect repeats that are complementary and antiparallel to one another. When transposons insert themselves into a new location, they do so by site-specific recombination, creating direct repeats (identical nucleotide sequences created during the repair of a staggered cut created by the transposon restriction endonuclease). Therefore, in the diagram shown, the rectangular blocks could represent either the direct repeats caused by transposition or the indirect repeats that are the outside edges of the mobile segments of DNA. In either event, they are representations of points at which transposons have inserted their mobile DNA via site-specific recombination. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes (choice A) is not correct. Although each transposon (and there are three that have moved to create the resistance transfer factor shown) carries its own restriction endonuclease and the gene that encodes it, the diagram clearly shows the presence of two rectangles for each of the transposons, and a given transposon would carry only one copy, not two copies, of its endonuclease gene. Introns (choice B) are repetitive, non-transcribed segments of DNA that do not occur in prokaryotes. Points of bacteriophage insertion (choice C) or insertion sequences are palindromic sequences of nucleotides in a bacterial genome that are identical to those found in the genomes of temperate phages. When these sequences are cleaved by a restriction endonuclease the phage genome can be inserted by site-specific recombination into the bacterial chromosome and the state of lysogeny is begun. Bacteriophages are not involved in the formation of resistance transfer factors. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are responsible for the formation of multiple drug-resistant plasmids such as the one shown here, but they are not represented by the rectangular blocks. In the diagram, the transposons are the sequences between the rectangular blocks, so there are three transposons that accumulated here to create this resistance transfer factor."

    "question": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain over the past 24 hours. She recently returned from a 4-month trip to Central America. She says that she had bloody diarrhea for the last 4 weeks of her trip. A CT scan of the abdomen shows lesions that appear to be multiple abscesses. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "C. Enterobius vermicularis",
      "D. Salmonella typhi",
      "E. Shigella species"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient probably has hepatic amebiasis, which is a life-threatening complication of intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. E. histolytica is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Intestinal colonization (which may be asymptomatic) always precedes infection of the liver. The abscesses generally contain necrotic debris, with amoebas located along the edges of the abscess. Treatment for liver abscesses of this origin is metronidazole, while iodoquinol is useful to destroy the luminal stages of the parasite. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) can cause intestinal obstruction, and may cause abscesses if it invades the common bile duct. It would not cause bloody diarrhea. Enterobius vermicularis (choice C) is the pinworm, which inhabits the rectum. Bloody diarrhea can also be seen with some strains of Salmonella (choice D) and Shigella (choice E), but these organisms do not usually cause hepatic abscesses. Bacterial causes of hepatic abscesses include E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas."

      "E. Septate hyphae at 45-degree angles",
      "F. spherules"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This is a classic case of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis. Clues include the patient population (HIV-positive), and the CSF findings suggesting a fungal etiology. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal meningitis of the immunocompromised in the United States. It is a monomorphic fungus, unlike many of the classic pathogens within the fungal group, so the encapsulated yeast form would be found both in clinical specimens and in the environment as the infectious form. Broad-based, budding yeasts (choice A) would be the forms expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Blastomyces dermatitidis - which is far more likely to present with skin and bone lesions than with meningitis. Budding yeasts in a 'pilot's wheel' arrangement (choice B) would be the form expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis which is limited in geographic region to Central and South America and typically presents as a primary pulmonary disease. Intracellular yeasts within macrophages (choice D) are the diagnostic form of Histoplasma capsulatum which, despite its name, is not an encapsulated yeast. It is primarily a pulmonary infection acquired by exposure to the droppings of birds or bats. Septate hyphae with 45-degree angles (choice E) are the transmission forms of Aspergillus which is a major opportunistic infection. Aspergillus may cause meningitis in this patient population, but it is not nearly as common as Cryptococcus. Spherules (choice F) would be the yeast forms characteristic of Coccidioides immitis which may be a cause of fungal meningitis in immunologically compromised individuals but is geographically restricted to the Sonoran desert zone of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever)."

The physician should monitor this pregnancy closely for the development of which of the fetal conditions?",
    "options": [
      "A. Congenital heart disease",
      "B. Cutaneous scarring",
      "C. Hemolytic anemia",
      "D. Hydrocephalus",
      "E. Non-immune hydrops"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. There are two parts to this question. The first is realizing that the student's illness is the classic description of Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum. It is caused by parvovirus B19, which is spread from human to human. Animals do not carry this particular parvovirus. The disease is contagious prior to the onset of the rash. The initial symptoms, during the period of contagion, are nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, myalgia, lethargy, coryza, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain. When the typical 'slapped-cheek' rash begins, the student is no longer contagious. The rash begins with the erythematous cheeks, then the upper part of the body becomes red and then reticulated, i.e., the typical lacy appearance of the rash develops. This fades but can come and go for the next 3 weeks. Parvovirus is a cause of aplastic anemia. It may be responsible for aplastic crises in patients with sickle-cell anemia. In addition, exposure of a pregnant woman in the first trimester may result in a fetus with aplastic anemia, which results in non-immune hydrops fetalis. Because the virus infects immature erythrocytes, causing severe anemia, the fetus dies of cardiac failure. Congenital heart defects (choice A) may occur due to many different reasons. They are, however associated with the congenital rubella syndrome, in which a patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis are most commonly seen. Cutaneous scarring (choice B) occurs in an infant with congenital varicella syndrome (exposure to varicella during pregnancy). The other major feature is limb defects. Hemolytic anemias (choice C) are usually not associated with prenatal exposure to an infectious agent. They may be produced due to isoimmunization (Rh disease), red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis), or red cell enzyme defects (pyruvate kinase deficiency), as well as many other etiologies. Hydrocephalus (choice D) also has diverse etiologies. There is an association with prenatal exposure to mumps and the fetal development of aqueductal stenosis resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus."

Which of the following mechanisms is responsible for the expression of the toxin that produces these signs?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Homologous recombination",
      "C. Lysogenic conversion",
      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The question describes a girl with streptococcal pharyngitis with a characteristic rash. This combination is scarlet fever, and is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes via its erythrogenic exotoxin (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, SPE). SPE-A, SPE-B, and SPE-C. The production of this extra virulence is an example of lysogenic conversion. In this case, the DNA of a temperate phage is inserted into the bacterial chromosome and produces a prophage. Besides the repressor protein, the prophage DNA also directs the synthesis of other gene products that make the bacteria more pathogenic. Conjugation (choice A) is one of the three methods whereby DNA is transferred from one cell to another. In this case, it is done by cell-to-cell contact. It is not the means by which the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins are expressed. Homologous recombination (choice B) is a gene exchange process that stabilizes some genes that have been introduced by conjugation, transformation, or transduction. During the process there is an exchange of pieces of DNA between a linear piece of DNA and a region on the stable circular bacterial chromosome. In site-specific recombination (choice D) a DNA molecule is integrated into a molecule of DNA with which it has no homology, except for a small site on each DNA that is called an insertion site. The end result is the sum of the two original DNA molecules. Transformation (choice E) is another way in which genes are transferred. In this case, naked DNA is taken up by another cell. Cells that can take up naked DNA from the environment need to become competent, and do so under certain environmental conditions. The newly introduced DNA is generally linear, homologous DNA from the same type of cell, but one that may be genetically diverse. Once introduced into the new cell, some genes may become stabilized by homologous recombination."

Which of the following mechanisms most likely accounts for the production of the new viral progeny?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. Genetic drift",
      "C. Genetic shift",
      "D. Phenotypic masking",
      "E. Phenotypic mixing"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza and other viruses with segmented genomes (Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus) are capable of genetic reassortment. This is an accidental 'shuffling' of the segments of genomic RNA so that new genetic combinations can be produced. Viruses that have segmented genomes have multiple pieces of RNA that must be assembled correctly in the progeny to produce a new generation that is identical to the parental generation. When accidental rearrangements occur, genetic shift results; and in influenza, this is responsible for the production of pandemics of disease. Complementation (choice A) occurs when two viruses infect a single cell. If one is defective in a certain gene product, progeny viruses can be produced as long as that defect can be 'complemented' by the makeup of the other virus. If both viruses have the same defect, no progeny viruses can be produced. In the case given here, two viable viruses were grown in a single cell and new combinations of surface molecules were produced. Genetic drift (choice B) refers to random mutational changes that can occur in any reproducing organism. These changes can change the surface of the organism, which affects the host immune response to the organism. Changes such as these are more gradual than genetic shift, and are best described in viruses such as HIV. Phenotypic masking (choice D) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is created from the genome of one of the viruses while the genome included in the capsid is from the other virus. Thus, one genome is 'masked' or covered with the antigens of the other virus. In the case described here, combinations of surface molecules were expressed. Phenotypic mixing (choice E) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is a mixture of the capsid antigens from the two parental viruses. Since the genomic RNA is not actually reassorted in that case, it would not be a stable genetic change but simply a reflection of the antigens of both parental viruses being inserted on the surfaces of a single progeny generation."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen that is associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and that commonly causes cystitis. It is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod that reduces nitrates to nitrites. It is important to know that the pili and motility of the bacteria contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with cystitis can develop bacteremia and subsequent septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The present patient has an obstructive lesion of the urinary tract that predisposes him to the overgrowth of microorganisms such as E. coli. Pulmonary symptoms are consistent with ARDS. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) might be a Neisseria sp. or Moraxella catarrhalis. N. gonorrhoeae is the cause of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that presents asymptomatically or with urethritis. Patients are usually younger and sexually active. M. catarrhalis is usually implicated as a cause of otitis media and sinusitis in children. It is also implicated as a cause of purulent tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in a population of patients who are older than 50 years and who have underlying obstructive lung disease. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis rarely cause cystitis. S. saprophyticus causes UTIs but the patients are typically young, sexually active women. Enterococcus is a relatively common cause of UTIs in hospitalized patients with indwelling urinary catheters who are receiving broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Enterococcal bacteremia can lead to endocarditis, but would not commonly cause ARDS. Gram-positive diplococci (choice D) would be a description of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Hepatitis E is an important cause of epidemics of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. These infections are most common in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America and are associated with a very high mortality among pregnant women. Hepatitis E is caused by a naked capsid RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae (formerly Caliciviridae). Adenoviridae (choice A) is a group of naked capsid double-stranded DNA viruses that may cause upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis, but are not generally associated with hepatitis. Flaviviridae (choice B) is the family to which hepatitis C virus belongs. This is an enveloped RNA virus that is usually transmitted sexually or parenterally, and although it is associated with a high degree of chronicity and carcinogenesis, it is not usually a cause of high mortality among pregnant women. Hepadnaviridae (choice C) is the family to which hepatitis B virus belongs. It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that is sexually or parenterally transmitted. It is associated with the production of chronic infections and hepatocellular carcinoma, but is not known for causing high mortality among pregnant women. Picornaviridae (choice E) is the family of naked capsid RNA viruses to which hepatitis A virus belongs. Although this virus is fecal-orally transmitted and therefore more common in developing countries, it is not associated with a high degree of mortality in pregnant women."

    "question": "An investigator is studying virus life cycles. He creates a continuous culture of kidney fibroblasts that are suitable hosts for a large variety of viral agents. In one experiment, the nuclei of these cells are removed by cytosurgery, and various viral agents are added to the cultures, Following culture of the viruses with the enucleated cells, the yield of cytopathic units of virus is quantified. Which of the following viruses would be capable of replication in these enucleated cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Cytomegalovirus",
      "C. Influenza virus",
      "D. JC virus",
      "E. Poliovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Most RNA viruses (e.g., poliovirus) replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore can replicate in enucleated cells. Poliovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae. These viruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA. The exception to the rule regarding RNA viruses is the family Orthomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses (choice C). Orthomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral mRNA transcription. Adenoviruses (choice A) are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome. All DNA viruses except the family Poxviridae carry out their replication in the nucleus, and therefore would not be capable of completing their life cycles in enucleated cells. Cytomegalovirus (choice B) is a member of family Herpesviridae. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome, and thus replicates in the nucleus. JC virus (choice D) belongs to family Polyomaviridae. It is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded circular DNA genome. It would not be able to complete its life cycle in an enucleated cell."

    "question": "A total of 2 x 10² Streptococcus viridans are inoculated into a flask containing 1 L of enriched broth. If the lag time is 30 minutes and the generation time is 20 minutes, how many bacteria will there be in the culture after 2.5 hours?",
    "options": [
      "A. 6 x 10²",
      "B. 12 x 10²",
      "C. 16 x 10²",
      "D. 32 x 10²",
      "E. 128 x 10²"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. During the lag time by definition, bacteria newly introduced into a culture will undergo metabolic changes necessary for use of the medium, but will not increase in number. Therefore, at the end of the first 30 minutes of elapsed time the number of bacteria in the culture will be 2 x 10². Thereafter, the number of bacteria will double every 20 minutes (the definition of 'generation time'). This means that after 2.5 hours (150 minutes) of total elapsed time, 120 minutes (150 min - 30 min lag) will be available for growth. Since generation time is 20 minutes, six generations will have occurred (120 min / 20 min/gen = 6 gen). So the original inoculum will double six times: 2 x 10² * 2⁶ = 2 x 10² * 64 = 128 x 10². Choice A (6 x 10²) is not the correct answer. The student who selects this answer forgot that lag periods occur only once per culture, and also incorrectly multiplied the starting inoculum number by an incorrect number of generations (three). Choice B (12 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of counting the number of possible generations and multiplying by that number. Remember that every generation time means that every bacterium in that culture has divided into two, so the student must multiply by 2 six times, or 2⁶. Choice C (16 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of forgetting that the lag time occurs only one time per culture. The student who selects this answer divided the 2.5 hours of culture time between three lag periods and three correctly calculated generations (2³). Choice D (32 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of including the lag period within the first generation time (overlapping the two, and forgetting that they are distinct and separate periods). The student who did this would therefore count five possible generations and, multiplying correctly thereafter by 2⁵, would arrive at this incorrect answer."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man with AIDS develops multifocal encephalitis. He reports having a unilateral, vesicular rash 1 month ago Treatment with acyclovir is begun, but he dies on the fourth day after admission. Which of the following viruses is most likely responsible for the development of encephalitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus",
      "B. Herpes simplex type-1",
      "C. Herpes simplex type-2",
      "D. Herpes zoster",
      "E. Measles virus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The specific clue to the cause of the severe encephalitis in this AIDS patient is the history of shingles, due to reactivation of the herpes zoster (varicella zoster) virus. In otherwise healthy adults, the virus (which is usually introduced to the body as a childhood case of chickenpox) remains dormant in a dorsal root ganglion only to reactivate in later life, causing a painful vesicular eruption that characteristically conforms to the distribution of a single dermatome. In AIDS patients, the virus can cause a severe multifocal encephalitis that may be resistant to acyclovir therapy. Cytomegalovirus (choice A) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but is less likely in the present patient, given his past history of shingles. Herpes simplex type-1 (choice B) and type-2 (choice C) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but are less likely in this patient, given his past history of shingles and the lack of response to acyclovir. Measles virus (choice E) appears to be related to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis but this condition is not specifically increased in AIDS patients."

The lesion appeared several weeks ago, but recently has expanded and become painful. Physical examination shows a 5-cm lesion with a black, necrotic center and raised erythematous edges. Which of the following toxins has a mechanism of action most similar to the toxin most likely responsible for this patient's skin lesion?",

      "H. Shigatoxin",
      "I. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins",
      "J. Tetanus toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient's wound is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the characteristic lesion described is called ecthyma gangrenosum. The Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which is responsible for the tissue damage, inhibits protein synthesis by acting on EF-2, with a primary target cell in the liver. The diphtheria toxin has a similar action, although its target cells are heart and nerve. Anthrax toxin (choice A) is a three-component toxin that contains a single binding component (protective antigen) and two active components. The edema factor (EF) is an adenylate cyclase that causes fluid loss from cells, and the lethal factor (LF) is an endoprotease that causes apoptosis. Botulinum toxin (choice B) is a neurotoxin that prevents neurosecretory vesicles from fusing with synaptic membranes and releasing acetylcholine. Cholera toxin (choice C) acts to increase adenylate cyclase activity by ribosylation of GTP-binding protein. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (choice D) is a lecithinase. Escherichia coli labile toxin (choice F) works in a fashion similar to the cholera toxin. Pertussis toxin (choice G) causes fluid loss by ribosylating Gi. Shigatoxin (choice H) decreases protein synthesis by inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins (choice I) act as superantigens to increase cytokine production. Tetanus toxin (choice J) is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA."

    "question": "A 4-year-old girl who recently emigrated from Somalia is brought fo the emergency department by her parents because of a fever and persistent cough. Her temperature is 40.1°C (104.2°F). Physical examination shows inspiratory stridor, and a thick, gray film covering the uvula and pharynx that bleeds when displaced with a tongue depressor. Cultures of the oropharyngeal secretions grow gram-positive rods. In the image above, the patient's isolate is strain 1. Which of the following best describes strain 1?",
    "options": [
      "A. It contains an episome",
      "B. It contains free plasmid DNA",
      "C. It contains a prophage",
      "D. It is not a diphtheroid",
      "E. It is a motile organism"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has developed diphtheria, which is rare in the United States because of our use of a very effective vaccine, the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis). Immigrant children from impoverished areas of the globe might not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is a gram-positive rod that is morphologically identical to normal flora organisms in the oropharynx, which are called diphtheroids. The difference between the pathogen and a normal flora diphtheroid is established using the ELEK test, which is shown in the image. This test involves diffusion in gel and a precipitation reaction that will occur when antigen (toxin) produced by the pathogen precipitates in the presence of antitoxin antibodies. In the image, the horizontal lines are the strains of bacteria to be tested for the production of the toxin. The vertical rectangle is a strip of filter paper that has been soaked in antitoxin antibodies. The white lines that form in the right angle where bacteria and filter paper meet are lines of precipitation. In C. diphtheriae, toxin production occurs following infection of the bacterium with a temperate phage that encodes the toxin. This is an example of lysogenic conversion. Episomes (choice A) are plasmids that have integrated into a bacterial chromosome; Diphtheria toxin is produced following stable integration of a phage genome into the chromosome, not due to the integration of plasmid DNA. Containing free plasmid DNA (choice B) is not the distinction between toxin-producing and non-producing strains of C. diphtheriae. The tetanus toxin is produced by virtue of possession of a non-conjugative plasmid by Clostridium tetani, but this is not true of diphtheria. It is not a diphtheroid (choice D). A diphtheroid is a non-toxin producing strain of C. diphtheriae (a normal flora organism). The strains that are streaked in the image as the two central lines are non-toxin producers (diphtheroids). It is a motile organism (choice E) is not the case and motility is not tested by the ELEK test. C. diphtheriae is a nonmotile organism, and the eventual development of peripheral neuropathies and cardiomyopathies during the pathogenesis are a result of the fact that the toxin becomes bloodborne, not that the organism moves from its site of residence in the oropharynx and upper airways."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man who is a farmer develops a pustule on the hand. The pustule ruptures to form a black eschar surrounded by expanding edema. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the development of these symptoms in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. A boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod",
      "B. A cigar-shaped yeast",
      "C. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine",
      "D. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining",
      "E. A large spirochete"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causative organism, Bacillus anthracis is found in many animal species, and humans can acquire the organism either through contact with animals or from locally contaminated soil. The pustule described in the question stem is called a 'malignant pustule' and may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy. Malignant pustules after rupture form a black eschar surrounded by edema. Most cases remain localized but death can occur as the result of complications such as bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Bacillus is a large, boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod that forms spores centrally placed inside the bacillus, so that they look like bamboo shoots. A cigar-shaped yeast (choice B) describes the tissue form of Sporothrix schenckii, the agent of rose-gardener's disease. The lesion in such a case would be a mycetoma, draining yellow granular pus through multiple sinus tracts. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine (choice C) describes Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. The organism can persist for weeks to months but does not form spores that could survive for hundreds or thousands of years. Most human cases occur in the endemic areas of the United States, in Arkansas and Missouri. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining (choice D) describes Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague. This organism does not form stable spores that can survive for extended periods of time. The hallmark of bubonic plague is the formation of buboes which are black, necrotic lymph nodes that form at the site of the vector fleabite. A large spirochete (choice E) describes Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme disease. In the first stage of this disease, there is a localized, expanding, erythematous rash rather than an eschar. Furthermore, Lyme disease occurs in the United States, Europe, and Asia, corresponding to the distribution of Ixodes ticks, which spread the infection."

    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative diplococci",
      "B. Gram-negative rods",
      "C. Gram-positive cocci",
      "D. Gram-positive rods",
      "E. Monomorphic yeast",
      "F. Septate hyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in this case are consistent with a fungal infection in the central nervous system (100-1000 cells, mostly lymphocytes, glucose <50 mg/dL, protein >=50 mg/dL). Cryptococcus is a monomorphic encapsulated yeast. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. While this patient is in the appropriate age group for meningococcal meningitis, his HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Gram-negative rods (choice B) would be indicative of any of the enteric organisms, particularly Escherichia coli. E. coli is an agent of neonatal meningitis and septicemia, but the patient's HIV status, age, and CSF findings refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) would be indicative of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of adult meningitis, but the CSF findings in this case refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive rods (choice D) would be indicative of Listeria monocytogenes, which also could be a feasible answer but again, the patient's HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Septate hyphae (choice F) would describe Aspergillus fumigatus, which is another fungal agent of meningitis in the immunocompromised, but it is not the most likely cause."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man develops malaise, fatigue, and anorexia after returning from a trip to Calcutta, India. His symptoms slowly resolve and he does not seek treatment. Three months later laboratory studies of serum show HBsAb Negative, HBeAb Positive, HBcAb Positive, HBeAg Negative, HBsAg Negative. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb is likely indicative of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. The patient has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B",
      "B. The patient is anergic to hepatitis B",
      "C. The patient is immune to hepatitis B",
      "D. The patient is in the window period",
      "E. The patient is making an excess of HBsAb"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has clearly returned from Calcutta with an active infection of hepatitis B, since his serum is positive for antibody against the core antigen of hepatitis B. This is the standard diagnostic for this infection. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb from the serum reflects that the patient has entered the 'window period,' a good prognostic indicator because it demonstrates that antibodies to the surface antigen are being made in enough concentration to precipitate the corresponding antigen out of the circulation. Successful vaccination against hepatitis B (choice A) would be reflected by a positive titer of HBsAb only. The presence of antibody against the e core antigen reflects the existence of an active infection. Anergy to hepatitis B (choice B) is not correct because a person who is anergic is selectively unresponsive or tolerant to the antigen in question. Clearly, the presence of antibodies to several of these viral antigens in the serum demonstrates that this patient is not anergic. Although the patient is beginning to mount a protective immune response (antibody to HBsAg, choice C), it has not yet reached a protective level. If the patient were making an excess of HBsAb (choice E), there would be a rising titer of HBsAb. Thus the patient would be positive for HBsAb and negative for HBsAg."

    "question": "An investigator is conducting a study of resistance of enterococcal species against penicillin and tetracycline. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for the acquisition of this type of multi-drug resistance?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacteriophage",
      "B. Exogenotes",
      "C. Prophage",
      "D. Restriction endonuclease",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Transposons are mobile segments of DNA that can move themselves or a copy of themselves from one molecule of DNA to another. They are found in eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. They need at least one gene coding for a transposase, which are the enzymes involved in this movement. The transposase recognizes a specific nucleotide sequence, and the DNA inserts into this position. This insertion creates direct repeats on each side of the transposon. Transposons include some genes for drug resistance and play an important role in building multiple-drug resistance plasmids. These multi-drug resistance plasmids have played a major role in the explosive spread of drug resistances throughout the bacterial world. Bacteriophages (choice A) are viruses that infect the bacterial cell. Temperate phage DNA may be inserted into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Imported bacterial DNA (i.e., DNA that has been transferred into a cell by conjugation, transformation, or transduction) is on short linear pieces of DNA called exogenotes (choice B). Most linear DNA is not stable in cells because it is broken down by exonucleases. Although technically all transferred DNA involved in emerging drug resistances is of exogenote origin, this is not the best answer because it is not specific enough. A prophage (choice C) is a repressed temperate phage DNA inserted into a bacterial chromosome. The prophage DNA may encode the synthesis of products that make bacteria more pathogenic. This enhanced virulence is called lysogenic conversion. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Restriction endonucleases (choice D) are site-specific endonucleases that recognize specific base sequences and cleave the nucleic acid backbone in the interior of the nucleic acid strand. Although restriction endonucleases are involved in transposon movement, they are not the means by which the drug resistances are acquired."

      "B. Image B",
      "C. Image C",
      "D. Image D",
      "E. Image E"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has a fungus ball, or aspergilloma. These noninvasive or minimally locally invasive lesions are caused by Aspergillus species. They show saprophytic growth in preexisting lung cavities, which may be formed by tuberculosis, tumor, bronchiectasis, or other chronic lung infections. Patients are often asymptomatic but may become allergic to the fungus. Aspergillus fumigatus is a dematiaceous (dark-colored) fungus which forms hyphae that branch at acute angles. Choice A is an image of the arthroconidia of Coccidioides immitis. These are the infectious forms that are found in desert sand. Coccidioides causes San Joaquin Valley fever, which may be an acute or chronic pulmonary condition but is unlikely to invade cavitary lesions of the lung and cause fungus balls. Choice B is an image of the infectious form of Sporothrix schenckii that causes rose-gardener's disease. These are hyphae with sleeves of conidia that would be found in vegetative material in gardens worldwide. Sporothrix causes cutaneous or lymphocutaneous lesions associated with puncture wounds formed while gardening or handling plant material. Choice D is an image of germ tubes (pseudohyphae) formed by Candida albicans when it invades tissues. Candida is an opportunistic pathogen, but it does not cause fungus balls by invading cavitary lesions in the lung.

    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Examples of viruses in the Poxvirus family are variola, vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum. All DNA viruses are icosahedral, except for Poxviruses, which are described as brick-shaped complexes. Poxvirus DNA is enveloped. All DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the nucleus, except for Poxvirus, which replicates in the cytoplasm via a virion-associated transcriptase. All of the enzymes and factors necessary for viral replication are then made in the cytoplasm. Adenoviruses (choice A) like the other DNA viruses (except Poxvirus), are icosahedral and have double-stranded linear DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The DNA is not enveloped and there is no virion-associated polymerase. The main example of the Hepadnavirus (choice B) family is the hepatitis B virus. It is icosahedral and contains partially double-stranded circular DNA that is enveloped. Viruses carry a DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity to synthesize an RNA intermediate that is then used to make genomic DNA. Herpesviruses (choice C) consist of herpes simplex, varicella zoster, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus. These are icosahedral and contain enveloped double-stranded linear DNA. The DNA replicates in the nucleus and the virus is assembled in the nucleus. Papillomaviruses (choice D) are icosahedral and contain naked double-stranded circular DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The most important of the Parvoviruses (choice E) is parvovirus B19. It is icosahedral and is the only DNA virus that contains single-stranded DNA, which is naked and replicates in the nucleus."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has the signs and symptoms of a viral encephalitis. During the summer months, most types of viral encephalitis are transmitted by mosquitoes. Examples of arthropod-borne viruses include St. Louis virus, West Nile encephalitis virus (Flaviviridae), and Eastern equine, Western equine, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (Togaviridae). Herpes simplex encephalitis is actually the most common type of encephalitis in the United States, but it is transmitted by direct contact with infected tissues. If this had been a herpes simplex encephalitis, the lumbar puncture would have yielded a high opening pressure and multiple red blood cells would have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Aerosol (choice A) is the mechanism of transmission of most of the respiratory viruses. Fecal-oral transmission (choice C) is the most common means of infection with most gastroenteritis viruses. Most of these viruses are naked capsid viruses which are able to withstand passage through the acidity of the stomach. Parenteral transmission (choice D) is common among the enveloped viruses, which require direct transfusion or transplantation to cause disease. Sexual transmission (choice E) is common among the enveloped viruses, which are extremely fragile in the environment."

      "E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Despite the stress placed on the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex in discussions about HIV-infected patients, “ordinary” tuberculosis, caused by M. tuberculosis is the most prevalent form of mycobacterial infection at this point. M. avium-intracellulare complex infections usually do not predominate until the CD4 cell count has fallen well below 100/uL. It is also important to maintain a particularly high index of suspicion in AIDS patients, in whom the chest x-ray may be initially normal, possibly due to an impaired immune response. Some of these cases may clinically (and pathologically) resemble a more conventional bacterial pneumonia, because the body substitutes a comparatively ineffective neutrophil response for the granulomatous response it has trouble mounting. M. avium-intracellulare (choice A) are unusual mycobacterial infections that are noted for causing pulmonary and disseminated infections in AIDS patients, but they are less prevalent than M. tuberculosis except when the CD4+ count is less than 60/uL. M. leprae (choice B) causes leprosy. It is not an infection that is associated with HIV infection in the United States. M. marinum (choice C) can cause fish-tank granuloma (an ulcerating granuloma on the hands of tropical fish enthusiasts) when it enters through cuts in the skin in people who maintain home fish tanks.

      "D. Helicobacter pylori",
      "E. Shigella dysenteriae"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The photograph shows a stomach with a perforated peptic ulcer. Perforation of a peptic ulcer is potentially fatal, because of either peritonitis with sepsis or sudden exsanguination (if the perforation damages one of the many arteries of the stomach). Peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, possibly gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma have been strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori colonization of the mucus layer covering the gastric mucosa. The most important pathogenic attribute of H. pylori is its production of urease, which neutralizes the acidic pH of the stomach and allows the organism to invade the mucosal surface. The urease-positive organisms can be remembered with the mnemonic PUNCH: Proteus, Ureaplasma, Nocardia, Cryptococcus, Helicobacter. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with the urease breath test. Campylobacter jejuni (choice A) is also a gram-negative curved rod but is not associated with the formation of gastric ulcers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, anaerobic rod that is associated with gangrene and a mild form of food poisoning. Escherichia coli (choice C) is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod associated with many forms of gastroenteritis but not with gastric ulcer formation. Shigella dysenteriae (choice E) is a gram-negative, lactose-negative rod associated with bloody diarrhea but not with gastric ulcers."

    "question": "A composite virus has been created that has the genome of the molluscum contagiosum virus and the capsid of poliovirus Which of the following genomes would the progeny viruses most likely have?",
    "options": [
      "A. DNA",
      "B. Double-stranded RNA, segmented",
      "C. Negative-stranded RNA",
      "D. Positive-stranded RNA",
      "E. Segmented RNA"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Composite viruses are viruses that are created in laboratories by artificially combining components of different parental viruses. In this case, the genetic material is DNA because the molluscum contagiosum virus is a double-stranded DNA virus in the poxvirus family. Thus the progeny viruses will have a double-stranded DNA genome. Double-stranded RNA, segmented (choice B) would be the genome of reoviruses, and neither poxviruses nor poliovirus have this form of genome. Negative-stranded RNA viruses (choice C) is the genome of many viruses including rabies and orthomyxoviruses, but neither is present in this composite virus. Positive-stranded RNA viruses (choice D) is the genome of the polioviruses, but because the example uses only the poliovirus capsid, the poliovirus nucleic acid would not be present in target cells. Segmented RNA (choice E) is carried by Reoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Arenaviridae, but none of these genomes were included in this composite virus."

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 100 cells, which are mostly lymphocytes, glucose of 35 mg/dL, and protein of 75 mg/dL. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm this patient's diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. India ink",
      "B. Latex particle agglutination",
      "C. Molecular probe",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Tzanck smear"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has symptoms and signs of a fungal cerebrospinal infection. The most common cause of meningitis in AIDS patients in the United States is Cryptococcus neoformans, which is an encapsulated, monomorphic yeast acquired from exposure to pigeon droppings. Although the USMLE likes to mention the India ink test of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in vignettes to avoid having to give away the diagnosis, India ink is not the preferred diagnostic test. The more sensitive test that is used in most hospital situations is latex particle agglutination to detect capsular antigens shed into the CSF. India ink (choice A), a test to diagnose cryptococcal infections, depends on the precipitation of a particulate dye around the capsular material of the organism. It misses about 50% of all infections. Molecular probes (choice C) are used in many diagnoses, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a variety of virus infections. It is not used for cryptococcal meningitis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (choice D) is used to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in infants. This assay detects integrated HIV (provirus). PCRs are available for other virus infections but are not used to diagnose cryptococcosis. Tzanck smear (choice E) is used to diagnose herpesvirus infections. It involves touching a slide or coverslip to a lesion to lift off the multinucleated giant cells caused by the infection."

      "A. Clonorchis sinensis",
      "B. Fasciolopsis buski",
      "C. Paragonimus westermani",
      "D. Schistosoma haematobium",
      "E. Taenia saginata"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The stones described are pigment stones, composed of relatively pure calcium bilirubinate. These stones are less common than cholesterol stones. Risk factors for pigment stones include hepatic cirrhosis (unclear mechanism), hemolytic anemias, and liver fluke infection, notably by the Oriental liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Fasciolopsis buski (choice B) is a large intestinal fluke that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal mucosal abscesses. Fasciola spp., not Fasciolopsis, are other liver flukes besides Clonorchis. Paragonimus westermani (choice C) is a lung fluke that can cause cough, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis. Schistosoma haematobium (choice D) is a blood fluke that tends to infect pelvic veins and may cause bladder disease (including cancer). Taenia saginata (choice E) is the beef tapeworm, and may cause intestinal obstruction."

A peripheral blood smear shows severe anemia, and a bone-marrow aspirate shows no erythroid precursor cells. Infection with which of the following is most likely responsible for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Coxsackie virus",
      "B. Echovirus",
      "C. Hepadnavirus",
      "D. Herpesvirus",
      "E. Parvovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses, of which only serotype B19 is pathogenic for humans. This virus causes three distinct syndromes: a childhood febrile rash known as erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), aplastic crisis in individuals with chronic hemolytic diseases (sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia, etc.), and congenital infections that can present as stillbirth, hydrops fetalis (analogous to severe Rh incompatibility), or severe anemia. Coxsackie viruses (choice A) usually cause coldlike illness, but can cause herpangina, myocarditis, and meningitis. Echoviruses (choice B) can infect a variety of organ systems (gastrointestinal, central nervous system, eyes, heart, respiratory, skin), but are not a cause of aplastic crises. Hepadnavirus (choice C) is the causative agent of hepatitis B. Herpesviruses (choice D) cause a variety of acute to chronic infections, including herpes simplex types 1 and 2, chickenpox, chronic herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus infection, and Epstein-Barr virus infections."

    "question": "A stable clone of bacteria that is susceptible to tetracycline is placed in culture with 10 bacteria that are resistant to tetracycline. Within 24 hours, all the bacteria in the culture are tetracycline-resistant. The genetic process by which this occurred is shown Which of the following best describes this process?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Homologous recombination",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The diagram shows the process of conjugation between an F+ donor and an F- recipient bacterium. This process transfers plasmids in their entirety from the donor to the recipient. The traits that will be transferred in this way are those encoded in the plasmid and all recipients will become donors in the process. Generalized transduction (choice B) can be accomplished by both lytic and temperative phage only during the lytic cycle. The process involves the phage mistakenly packaging bacterial DNA into the capsid and transferring the DNA to another bacterial cell. In this type of transduction any gene can be transferred. Homologous recombination (choice C) is not a mechanism of genetic transfer for bacteria but a mechanism by which bacterial nucleic acid is stabilized following transfer. Transformation, transduction, and Hfr conjugation are all followed by homologous recombination requiring recombinase A. Specialized transduction (choice D) can only be accomplished by a temperate phage in which there is an excision error during induction of the phage from the bacterial chromosome. In this case, bacterial nucleic acid is mistakenly excised along with phage DNA. Only certain genes (located next to the phage insertion sites) have an opportunity to be transferred. Transformation (choice E) is the uptake of naked DNA by certain 'competent' bacterial cells."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman develops a dry cough, fever, headache, and muscular pains. She has been treated unsuccessfully for the past 1 week with aspirin and ampicillin. Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath and worsening cough. An x-ray of the chest shows scattered interstitial opacities. Treatment with erythromycin is begun and her symptoms rapidly improve. Which of the following findings is most likely associated with the causal organism of patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cold agglutinins",
      "B. Dieterle silver staining",
      "C. Quellung reaction",
      "D. Requirement for cysteine",
      "E. Requirement for factors X and V"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient's clinical presentation is typical of primary atypical pneumonia. This type of pneumonia is typically caused by intracellular organisms such as viruses, or Chlamydiae, but since Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall, it does not elicit the characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate caused by most other bacteria. Because the patient's infection responded to erythromycin, it cannot have been caused by a virus; so the most likely causative agent is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A finding in about 65% of Mycoplasma patients is the production of cold agglutinins: IgM isohemagglutinins that will agglutinate autologous erythrocytes at 4°C (39.2°F). The Dieterle silver stain (choice B) is used to identify Legionella pneumophila, which is an agent of atypical pneumonia of the elderly but would be more likely in a smoker or immunosuppressed patient. Legionella would respond to erythromycin, but this patient is not immunocompromised. The Quellung reaction (choice C) is a technique used to identify the capsular serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium is the most common cause of adult typical pneumonia and would not cause the interstitial presentation described here. Requirement for cysteine (choice D) is a characteristic of four genera of bacteria: Francisella, Legionella, Brucella, and Pasteurella. Although Francisella, Legionella, and Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens that could cause atypical pneumonia, they would not be expected in this patient. Francisella is acquired from ticks or from handling infected reservoir animals. Brucella is acquired from contaminated dairy products or contact with animals. Legionella is a disease of elderly smokers who are immunosuppressed. Pasteurella is found in the mouths of many animals and is transmitted most commonly from cat bites. Requirement for factors X and V (choice E) is characteristic of Haemophilus. Haemophilus is an extracellular bacterium that causes otitis media, epiglottitis, pharyngitis and meningitis in unvaccinated children who are between 3 months and 2 years of age. It would not be expected in the present patient's age group."

    "options": [
      "A. 2-to-5-μm yeast with a thin cell wall but no true capsule",
      "B. 4-to-10-μm yeast with a broad, slimy capsule",

      "D. 20-to-50-μm nonbudding spherule filled with endospores",
      "E. Hyphae branching dichotomously at acute angles"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. A variety of fungi can produce acute or chronic lung disease like that described in this case history. They are distinguished by geographic incidence and examination of the sputum or biopsy. Histoplasma capsulatum which causes histoplasmosis, is observed most frequently in the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri river valleys of the United States (Central U.S.). The organism is a small (2-to-5-μm) intracellular yeast which, despite the name, has no true capsule. Calcifying lesions forming in the lungs are very suggestive of fungal infection. Blastomyces dermatitidis could cause similar presentation in this area, but it would be found in the sputum as a broad-based budding yeast, and that option is not available within the choices. Choice B describes Cryptococcus which is the most common cause of fungal meningitis in immunosuppressed patients notably those with AIDS or hematopoietic disorders. Choice C describes Paracoccidioides which can cause pulmonary disease in patients from South and Central America. Choice D describes Coccidioides, which can cause skin lesions or pulmonary disease in the desert southwest and far west of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever). Choice E describes Aspergillus an opportunistic fungus that can invade cavitary lesions in the lung and cause aspergilloma, or fungus ball."

He says that he felt well until 4 days ago, but now has a headache and has been vomiting. His temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). Physical examination shows no rash, ulceration, or petechiae Laboratory studies show an absolute leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased serum transaminases. A peripheral blood smear shows granulocytes that contain berry-like clusters of intracellular organisms. The vector for the causative agent of his illness is the same as that for which of the following organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "B. Francisella tularensis",
      "C. Plasmodium vivax",
      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has granulocytic ehrlichiosis, caused by Ehrlichia phagocytophila. This intracellular bacterium is transmitted by the Ixodes tick, which also transmits Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. The disease presents similarly to Rocky Mountain spotted fever but does not have a rash. The pathognomonic feature in this case history is the presence of morulae (berry-like clusters of organisms) inside the patient's granulocytes. Francisella tularensis (choice B) can be transmitted in a number of different ways, but when an arthropod is implicated, it is the Dermacentor tick. This is the same tick that transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Tularemia is an ulceroglandular disease with fever, ulcer at the bite site, and lymph node enlargement. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of most of the encephalitis viruses, all species of malaria parasites, dengue yellow fever, and filariasis. This patient clearly does not have encephalitis, and malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and filariasis would not be expected in a 16-year-old boy in the continental United States. Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) is the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and is transmitted by the Dermacentor tick. Rocky Mountain spotted fever has a characteristic rash that begins on the ankles and wrists progressing toward the trunk. The Weil-Felix test, which is a nonspecific test for antibodies that agglutinate Proteus organisms, would be positive. This tick also transmits Francisella tularensis but the symptoms of this patient are not consistent with either tularemia (an ulceroglandular disease) or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (choice E) is the agent of scrub typhus. It is transmitted by mites in the genus Leptotrombidium. Rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari) is also transmitted in this fashion, but both of these diseases are rare in the United States and would be characterized by rash and Weil-Felix test positivity."

      "A. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci",
      "B. Gram-positive, catalase-negative diplococci",
      "C. Motile flagellated trophozoites",
      "D. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies",
      "E. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles",
      "F. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has acquired primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri. This organism is a free-living ameba that is found in warm freshwater lakes. During the act of diving into such lakes, changes in pressure can force the organism through the cribriform plate and result in the production of necrotic lesions spreading from the olfactory lobes. The form of the organism that is found in human tissue is a flagellated trophozoite. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. This is a common cause of meningitis in young adults, but the case history would have to describe the presence of petechial hemorrhages from endotoxin toxicity. N. meningitidis overproduces outer membrane fragments and thus produces very early signs of endotoxin shock compared to other gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive catalase-negative diplococci (choice B) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although this is the most common cause of typical pneumonia, meningitis and sinusitis in the United States, it is not associated with swimming or diving, and the CSF would have shown extremely high numbers of neutrophils, low glucose, and high protein. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice D) describes cells infected with herpes simplex virus. This is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. It is not associated with swimming or diving. Although the CSF cell, protein, and glucose values could have indicated a viral etiology, herpes simplex encephalitis is also associated with a high opening pressure and the presence of many red blood cells. Encephalitis is also generally associated with confusion or change in mental status. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles (choice E) describes the zygomycophyta: bread mold fungi in the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, and Mucor. These agents can cause fatal rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and adults with cancer. The symptoms would be quite similar to those described in this case history, but these are opportunistic pathogens that do not cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts (choice F) describes Cryptococcus neoformans. This monomorphic fungus is the principal cause of meningitis in patients with Hodgkin disease or AIDS."

Which of the following tests will be most helpful in confirming the identity of the most likely causal agent of his fever and respiratory symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. CD4 cell count",
      "B. Direct fluorescent antibody test",
      "C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Western blot"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The most common atypical pneumonia in AIDS is caused by the atypical fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii). Patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia have great difficulty producing sputum, so bronchial lavage or transmural biopsy are generally required. The sample is then submitted to the direct fluorescent antibody test or stained with Gomori methenamine silver stain to visualize the organisms. The direct fluorescent antibody test is a technique to demonstrate the presence of antigen from a pathogen in a patient. Antigen-detecting tests will remain useful throughout the life of an AIDS patient because they do not depend on detection of the patient's immune response to the pathogen (which may be absent at the end of AIDS). When stained with methenamine silver, Pneumocystis cysts have a characteristic cup or boat shape; the individual cells are difficult to demonstrate without electron microscopy. CD4 cell count (choice A) is used to measure the progression of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since the virus infects and destroys these cells, the number remaining in the circulation becomes a good predictor of the progression of disease. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (choice C) is used as the screening test to diagnose HIV infection. It is a serologic test (i.e., identifies antibodies against the virus) and once the patient progresses into full-blown AIDS, antibody levels other than IgM will decline, so in general, serologic tests in late HIV infection tend to be less useful than tests that detect antigens from a pathogen. Polymerase chain reaction (choice D) is used to detect the viral load of the HIV virus in infected patients and infants. Western blot (choice E) is the confirmatory serologic test that is used in the diagnosis of HIV infection."

      "A. Cell wall",
      "B. Cytoplasmic membrane",
      "C. Flagella",
      "D. Outer surface protein",
      "E. Periplasmic space"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This woman has developed a positive tuberculin skin test indicating exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The molecule injected into the skin of the forearm to elicit this response is a purified protein derivative (PPD), which is composed of tuberculin (an outer surface protein) and mycolic acids of the organism. This is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction requiring sensitized TH1 cells. Only proteins can evoke such responses, since T cells are only capable of recognizing peptides presented to them in the context of an MHC molecule. The cell wall (choice A) of mycobacteria contains a thinner-than-normal layer of peptidoglycan and mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids. However, this material is not proteinaceous and therefore does not stimulate the TH1 cells necessary for the formation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The cytoplasmic membrane (choice B) of mycobacteria is a phospholipid bilayer that is similar to the inner membranes of all other prokaryotes and does not contribute to the specific skin test for tuberculosis. Flagella (choice C) are not present on M. tuberculosis because the organism is not motile. M. tuberculosis does not possess a periplasmic space (choice E) because it is an organism that is taxonomically related to the gram-positives. Only gram-negative bacteria possess a periplasmic space."

Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the brain shows demyelination with abnormal giant oligodendrocytes, some of which contain eosinophilic inclusions.

      "D. Multiple sclerosis",
      "E. Rabies",
      "F. Syphilis",
      "G. Tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rapidly progressive demyelinating disorder in which the JC virus (a polyomavirus) infects oligodendroglial cells in the brain. The eosinophilic inclusions represent accumulations of JC virus. PML occurs in about 1% of AIDS patients, and is the AIDS-defining illness in half of the patients who develop the condition. Symptoms include aphasia, hemiparesis, cortical blindness, ataxia, and conjugate gaze abnormalities. The condition can progress to quadriparesis and coma. There is no effective treatment for this disorder. Shingles and postinfectious encephalitis can follow chickenpox (choice B) but varicella is not specifically associated with demyelination. Measles (choice C) can cause an encephalitis and, in some cases, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) may follow previous measles infection. These disorders would affect not only white matter but gray matter as well. Also, SSPE usually occurs before the age of 18. Multiple sclerosis (choice D) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease characterized by demyelination. The immunologic basis of the pathology appears to be that TH1 lymphocytes reactive against myelin stimulate macrophages to destroy the myelin. It is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity response. Women are affected twice as often as men. The disease tends to have a relapsing and remitting course and may involve visual impairment, cranial nerve signs, ataxia, nystagmus, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Spinal cord lesions give rise to motor and sensory difficulties of the trunk and limbs, and spasticity and loss of control of bladder function. Rabies (choice E) produces eosinophilic inclusions (Negri bodies) in the brain but these are found in the gray matter. Signs of rabies would include excessive salivation, hallucinations, and hydrophobia. Syphilis (choice F) can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord damage, but the disease process would not be limited to the white matter. Tuberculosis (choice G) can cause a granulomatous meningitis, typically affecting the base of the brain."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The patient is suffering from conjunctivitis caused by Haemophilus, a fastidious organism requiring factors V (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and X (hematin), which must be released from whole-blood preparations to be accessible to the organism. This can be done by gentle heating, which lyses the red blood cells, or by co-culture with Staphylococcus aureus, which is beta-hemolytic and lyses the red blood cells to provide the factors Haemophilus needs for growth. This is called the satellite phenomenon. Antibiotics (choice A) would not be necessary since, with proper culture techniques, no normal flora should be available to confuse the diagnosis of conjunctivitis. Antibiotics and antifungals are added to chocolate agar to create Thayer-Martin medium to prevent the growth of normal flora when culturing from the genital tract. Cold temperature (choice B) would not be necessary because Haemophilus grows at normal body temperature. Listeria is the genus commonly mentioned for which a cold temperature is necessary. Cholesterol (choice C) is necessary for the growth of Mycoplasma but not Haemophilus. Low oxygen tension (choice D) is necessary for the growth of the microaerophiles (such as Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Borrelia), but is not a condition for growth of Haemophilus."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This woman has developed a pulmonary abscess, as evidenced by the chest radiograph. Of the organisms listed, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely cause of bacterial pneumonia complicated by abscess formation. Bacteria that commonly produce pneumonia that develops in the context of influenza include Staph. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of these, Staph. aureus is most destructive to lung tissue and likely to cause cavitary lesions. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus (choice A) describes Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium would be a cause of pneumonia in alcoholic or diabetic patients, or in those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A gram-positive catalase-negative alpha-hemolytic diplococcus (choice B) describes Strep. pneumoniae. This agent causes a necrotizing abscessing pneumonia with appearance similar to that of Staph. aureus, but it rarely causes cavitary lesions. A silver-staining cyst (choice D) describes Pneumocystis jiroveci. This agent is associated with atypical pneumonia in the immunocompromised or in premature infants.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is varicella (chickenpox), which is the primary form of infection by the herpes zoster (varicella-zoster) virus. Recurrence due to virus harbored in neurons tends to be dermatomal in distribution and is called shingles. Fever, malaise, headache, and myalgia may also be present, particularly in the prodromal phase. Tzanck smear of the base of a vesicle may demonstrate multinucleated giant cells. Immunocompromised patients can be treated with acyclovir to prevent dissemination. Chickenpox may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, systemic spread (immunosuppressed patients), neurologic involvement (rare), Reye syndrome (rare), and/or hemolytic anemia (rare). Genital vesicles and ulcers (choice A) are associated with herpes simplex type 2. Infectious mononucleosis (choice B) is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Orchitis (choice C) can complicate mumps infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (choice E) is a rare complication of measles infection."

    "question": "An 18-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of fever, chills, and sore throat. Physical examination shows marked pharyngeal hyperemia, tonsillar exudates, cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Treatment with ampicillin is begun. Two weeks later, he returns to the physician because of a generalized maculopapular rash. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chest x-ray",
      "B. ELISA",
      "C. Heterophile antibody test",
      "D. Lateral x-ray of the neck",
      "E. Rapid antigen test",
      "F. Varicella virus indirect immunofluorescence"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient most likely has infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The clinical features include sore throat, headache, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, hepatosplenomegaly, periorbital edema, rash, and a palatal enanthem. The diagnosis is made by heterophile antibody testing (monospot), EBV antibody titers, and the finding of lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. Treatment includes rest, fluids, and analgesics. Treatment with penicillin derivatives (ampicillin) leads to a maculopapular rash. Chest x-ray (choice A) is useful for a respiratory or cardiac process. Infectious mononucleosis cannot be diagnosed by any radiographic study. ELISA (choice B) would be a useful screening test for a variety of infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A lateral x-ray of the neck (choice D) is useful in acute epiglottitis; it would show epiglottic swelling. The symptoms of epiglottitis include extreme sore throat, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. A rapid antigen test (choice E) is used to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is characterized by fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A scarlatiniform rash may follow the pharyngitis. The rash, a diffuse erythema that later desquamates, is caused by an erythrotoxin. Antibodies to the varicella virus (choice F) can be detected by immunofluorescence. The symptoms of varicella include a vesicular rash (in various stages of evolution), fever, and malaise. The treatment is bathing soaks and antipruritic topical medication. Treatment with aspirin has been associated with Reye syndrome and should therefore be avoided."

    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a fever, nausea, diarrhea, and a rash. Her last menstrual period began 3 days ago. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a diffuse erythematous rash with areas of desquamation over the hands and feet.

      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus",
      "E. Single-stranded diploid RNA virus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a multisystem syndrome caused by a toxin (TSST-1) formed by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. TSS usually affects several organ systems (gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary) and can result in death. TSS has historically been associated with the use of tampons in young women, but can also occur in other patient populations. Fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and diffuse rash with desquamation of the hands and feet are common symptoms. Management of shock, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a priority if these conditions are present, in addition to appropriate antibacterial treatment. S. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting, nonmotile, non-H₂S-producing bacillus (choice A) describes the genus Shigella, which causes dysentery, characterized by fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea. A gram-positive anaerobic rod (choice B) describes Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene with necrosis of soft tissues, usually after a traumatic wound. It is also a cause of food poisoning. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus (choice D) describes Staph. epidermidis, which is part of the normal skin flora but is notorious for causing infections of intravenous lines and prosthetic heart valves. A single-stranded diploid RNA virus (choice E) describes the retroviruses. Although HIV-1 can cause many diverse findings and should never be immediately ruled out, the findings in the present patient are most specific for TSS."

      "D. Plague",
      "E. Poliovirus",
      "F. Rabies",
      "G. Tularemia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, first reported in 1993, consists of fever, myalgia, and rapid development of respiratory failure leading to death. The initial cases were mostly among Navajo Indians, however, cases have been documented in many U.S. states and in Canada. It is most common in the U.S. Four Corners states: New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. The causative agent is a hantavirus belonging to the family Bunyaviridae. The virus has also been called the Sin Nombre (Spanish for 'without a name') virus. Infection is thought to be through inhalation of aerosolized secretions from the common deer mouse. The disease typically begins with a nonspecific prodrome (fever, generalized myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances) followed 4 to 5 days later by respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea). This progresses rapidly to an adult respiratory distress syndrome and, in many cases, death. California encephalitis (choice A) is caused by an arbovirus transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Most cases are in children younger than 10 years of age. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Myalgias and arthralgias are typically present. Seizure activity is most frequently observed in infants and young children. Most cases are in the midwestern United States. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (choice B) is a Herpesvirus that produces a variety of infections. Primary CMV infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients, but can cause a heterophile-negative mononucleosis syndrome. Perinatal infections can occur in utero, intrapartum, or postpartum, and can produce congenital malformations. CMV can be transmitted by leukocytes in blood transfusions. In patients with AIDS or other immunosuppressive states, CMV can produce severe disease, including retinitis, pneumonia, encephalitis, adrenalitis, and gastrointestinal tract ulcerations. Plague (choice D) is caused by Yersinia pestis. It is endemic in the desert southwest of the United States, but plague normally begins with an extremely high fever, conjunctivitis, and septicemia. If it is acquired by fleabite, then buboes (hemorrhagic lymph nodes) will be found; if it is acquired in the pneumonic form, then cough will be observed. Poliovirus (choice E) is a member of the Picornavirus family. It remains epidemic in parts of Asia and Africa even though the wild type has been eliminated from the western hemisphere. The virus affects cranial nerve nuclei and anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, producing a flaccid paralysis that is usually asymmetric. Vaccine-related polio can occur with the live virus vaccine. Rabies (choice F) is a Rhabdovirus that produces encephalitis and/or myelitis. It should be considered in persons who have recently traveled outside of the United States. The most common sources of exposure are dogs, cats, skunks, foxes, raccoons (in Florida and Connecticut), wolves, and bats. The infection is acquired from the bite of a rabid animal or by inhalation. Rabies also has been reported to occur in patients after corneal transplantation. The virus spreads along peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. Symptoms include hallucinations, hydrophobia and copious salivation. Tularemia (choice G) is caused by Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative, cysteine-requiring facultative intracellular bacillus. The disease is most common in Arkansas and Missouri, and is acquired by handling, ingesting, or inhaling material from infected reservoir animals such as deer, rabbits and small rodents. It may also be transmitted by ticks from one of the reservoir animals to humans. Tularemia is generally characterized by disseminated granulomatous lesions, and would not be expected to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome."

    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of a headache and a high fever. He recently returned from a 2-week trip to Europe where he went diving in several natural pools. A diagnosis of meningoencephalitis localized to the base of his brain is made. A photomicrograph of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is shown. Through which of the following structures did the causal organism most likely gain access to the brain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cavernous sinus",
      "B. Cribriform plate",
      "C. Lacrimal bone",
      "D. Mandible",
      "E. Nasal bone",
      "F. Zygomatic bone"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The rare but life-threatening meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri apparently ensues when the organism enters the body through the nasal mucosa and crosses the cribriform plate to enter the brain via the olfactory nerves. It has been speculated that changes in pressure created during diving predispose to this infection. The cavernous sinus (choice A) is the site of entry of the zygomycophyta (Rhizopus, Mucor or Absidia) into the brain in diabetic ketoacidotic patients or adults with cancer. The lacrimal bone (choice C) of the medial aspect of the orbit does not appear to be involved in amebic infection. The mouth and its associated bones, including the mandible (choice D), do not appear to be routes of infection for this organism. The nasal bones (choice E) located on the superior surface of the nose, do not appear to be a route of infection for this organism. The zygomatic bone (choice F) which forms the cheekbone, does not appear to be a route of infection for this organism."

    "question": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of malaise, loss of appetite. nausea. and jaundice. Laboratory studies show a serum alanine transaminase (ALT) of 3,200 U/L. Serology for hepatitis viruses is performed and shows the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM antibody Antibody tests for HBsAb and HAV are negative. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these results?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute HBV infection",
      "B. A dual infection of HBV and HAV",
      "C. Chronic hepatitis B infection",
      "D. Immunity to hepatitis B virus",
      "E. Past hepatitis A infection"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) along with hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM Ab), and the absence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), indicate the early stages of an acute infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). A dual infection of HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (choice B) is not plausible since the IgM anti-HAV serology is negative. Chronic HBV infection (choice C) is unlikely because the patient has HBc IgM Ab, which is characteristic of an acute infection rather than a chronic infection. Immunity to HBV (choice D) is not plausible due to the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM Ab and the lack of HBsAb. Past hepatitis A infection (choice E) would be manifested by the presence of IgG antibodies against HAV."

      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has acute infective endocarditis. The most common cause of acute bacterial endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus. This type of endocarditis is typically acquired by illicit intravenous drug use, which can introduce skin organisms into the venous system that then attack the tricuspid valve. Staph. aureus accounts for between 60 and 90% of cases of endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Damage to the tricuspid valve is common. The endocarditis associated with congenital heart disease (choice B) typically involves either damaged valves or atrial or ventricular septal defects. The tricuspid valve is not particularly vulnerable. Rheumatic fever (choice C) most commonly damages the mitral and aortic valves, and tricuspid damage is usually less severe and seen only when the mitral and aortic valves are heavily involved. Rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) is not associated with bacterial endocarditis. Systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) can produce small, aseptic vegetations on the ventricular and atrial surfaces of the mitral valve (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)."

      "D. Pili",
      "E. Pneumolysin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common causes of otitis media in children are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In a vignette that gives no Gram stain or culture characteristics, the answer should refer to the number one cause, in this case Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most important virulence factor in Strep. pneumoniae is the capsule, which protects against phagocytosis. Lipopolysaccharide (choice B) is present in all gram-negative bacteria and would not be found in Strep. pneumoniae which is gram-positive. Non-pilus adhesins (choice C) exist in many organisms, and mediate adherence to the epithelial surfaces. For example, hemagglutinin molecules of bacteria and viruses fit this definition, and some toxins like the pertussis toxin have adhesive abilities. Pili (choice D) are glycoprotein “hairs” which mediate attachment to the epithelium. In gram-positives such as this one they are referred to as fimbriae and in gram-negatives they are extremely important virulence factors in allowing colonization of the uroepithelium by Escherichia coli, for example. Pneumolysin (choice E) is a cytotoxin produced by Strep. pneumoniae which destroys ciliated epithelial cells."

      "A. Flea",
      "B. Louse",
      "C. Mosquito",
      "D. Reduviid bug",
      "E. Tick"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has myocarditis due to Trypanosoma cruzi. This infectious condition, known as Chagas disease, is endemic in vast areas of South America and is transmitted from person to person by the reduviid bug, also known as the 'kissing bug'. Experts assess the number of persons with Chagas disease at about 7 million, with about 35 million at risk in South America. T. cruzi is an intracellular protozoan that localizes mainly in the heart and nerve cells of the myenteric plexus, leading to myocarditis and dysmotility of hollow organs, such as the esophagus, colon, and ureter. Cardiac involvement manifests with ventricular dilatation and congestive heart failure secondary to myocyte necrosis and fibrosis. Intracellular parasites can be visualized in tissue sections. Chagas disease is a cause of acquired achalasia, in which the distal third of the esophagus dilates because of loss of its intrinsic innervation. A similar pathologic mechanism accounts for megacolon and megaureter in Chagas disease. The flea (choice A) is the vector for Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. The louse (choice B) is the vector for Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus. The mosquito (choice C) is the vector for many of the Arboviruses that cause encephalitis. West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis are examples. Ticks (choice E) are the vectors for Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia, Rickettsia rickettsii, for example."

    "question": "A strain of Escherichia coli is resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, ampicillin, kanamycin, and neomycin Another strain of the same bacteria is not resistant to any of these drugs. When 100 bacteria from the resistant strain are added to a flask of bacteria of the sensitive strain and incubated overnight, all the bacteria in the flask develop resistance to the full complement of antibiotics Which of the following best explains these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation",
      "B. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction",
      "C. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction",
      "D. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation",
      "E. Transfer of multiple drug-resistance plasmids via conjugation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli are well known for their ability to transfer multiple-drug resistances during a single conjugative event. When these resistance genes become accumulated on a plasmid capable of mediating conjugation (a fertility factor), all drug-resistance genes are transferred efficiently and swiftly to the other partner of conjugation. Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation (choice A) would not be likely to have the same level of efficiency as that described in the question stem. Although the Hfr cell transfers some DNA via conjugation, it transfers chromosomal DNA, not plasmid DNA. Because the chromosome is so much larger, the exchange is never complete, and only some genes can be successfully transferred in each conjugative event. Because all the sensitive bacteria in this experiment acquired all the drug-resistance genes, it is unlikely that these were all chromosomal genes. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction (choice B) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Generalized transduction is the mechanism by which a lytic phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction (choice C) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Specialized transduction is the mechanism by which a temperate phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation (choice D) requires the uptake of free DNA from the environment by competent cells. It is not likely that such a large amount of DNA could be transferred in this way with 100% efficiency."

      "B. Clostridium perfringens",
      "C. Escherichia coli",
      "D. Shigella sonnei",
      "E. Staphylococcus aureus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxin A, which is the likely contaminant that was present in the pastries. When ingested, the toxin causes severe nausea and vomiting within a few hours (average incubation time: 3-6 hours). There is little diarrhea associated with this type of food-poisoning outbreak. Bacillus cereus (choice A) is a gram-positive, spore-forming rod that is associated with food-poisoning outbreaks following the ingestion of rice served in buffet-style restaurants. The time of onset and the symptoms would mimic staphylococcal disease; the major differentiating feature is the food involved. This organism survives the boiling of the rice because it is a spore-former. It germinates as the rice cools, then it grows and elaborates an enterotoxin. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe that can cause a longer incubation (8-to-24-hour) food poisoning, typically with marked diarrhea. Once again, the spores allow the organism to survive the heating process used in the preparation of the food. C. perfringens is associated with re-heated meat dishes. The symptoms of Escherichia coli (choice C) food poisoning are usually watery diarrhea (traveler's diarrhea) with minimal nausea and vomiting, or a bloody diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive strains of the agent. Shigella sonnei (choice D) causes enterocolitis characterized by fever cramps, and diarrhea after an incubation period of 1 to 4 days. Transmission is fecal-oral, associated with poor hygiene. A wide range of foods has been implicated."

    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. This is a typical case description of chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, a pleomorphic, gram-negative rod that displays a characteristic pattern ('school of fish') on Gram-stained slides. It grows on chocolate agar or on whole blood agar with a satellite phenomenon (around Staphylococcus aureus). Treat with azithromycin or ceftriaxone. Encapsulated bacteria inside mononuclear cells (choice A) describes Klebsiella granulomatis, the agent of granuloma inguinale. This disease is rare in the United States and would be expected most commonly in the tropics of Africa. It is generally a painless genital or perianal lesion that begins as a beefy-red bump and then breaks into granulation tissue that bleeds easily. Epithelial cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice B) are found with herpes simplex infections but these lesions would be vesicular and painful. Iodine-staining intracellular inclusion bodies (choice C) would be found during infections with Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of lymphogranuloma venereum, but this lesion is generally nonpainful. It is associated with lymphadenopathy and genital elephantiasis. Koilocytotic squamous epithelial cells (choice D) are found in infections with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is associated with genital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and penile cancer. Neutrophils containing gram-negative diplococci (choice E) would be found if this were gonorrhea. However, in gonorrhea, the patient would have a leukorrheic urethral discharge, and not the ulcerative genital lesion described here. Spirochetes (choice G) would be found on darkfield microscopy if this were a case of syphilitic chancre but that chancre would be hard and nontender."

      "D. The rash is a normal side effect of the MMR",
      "E. The vaccine was contaminated with live virus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The rash shown in the image is clearly unilateral and follows a dermatome, which is diagnostic of the rash of shingles, the second manifestation of infection with the varicella zoster virus. After the initial episode of chickenpox (primary infection), the varicella zoster virus develops a latent infection in the sensory ganglia. If the latent virus is reactivated, shingles develops. The majority of cases of chickenpox present in children, who will show an asynchronous pruritic rash consisting of papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusted lesions in crops in various stages. Shingles mainly presents in the elderly population as unilateral painful vesicles restricted to one dermatome. When shingles occurs in young children such as this one, it is typically due to the fact that the initial exposure to varicella zoster happened during a period of time when the child was passively protected by maternal antibodies acquired across the placenta or in breast milk. Because the child does not develop a robust active response to this infection, reactivational disease tends to onset at earlier than the normal age. Exposure of a 'naive' individual to chickenpox (choice B) or to shingles (choice C) would result in a case of chickenpox, which has different symptomatology from that described. The MMR is an attenuated live virus vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella. Adverse reactions to the MMR include fever, arthralgia and rash, but the rash shown here is clearly shingles, which is caused by varicella zoster virus (choice D). Contamination with live virus (choice E) is not a possibility because any contamination of the MMR vaccine with varicella zoster virus would have resulted in a case of chickenpox, not shingles."

Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A,B, Ba and C) causes a conjunctival and corneal infection that is spread in developing countries by eye-seeking flies and hand-to-eye contact. The lesions begin with formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva. With disease progression, there is tissue necrosis, granulation tissue deposition, and scar formation, leading to lacrimal duct obstruction and distortion of the eyelids. The organism is an obligate intracellular parasite spread from human to human in a metabolically inactive, extracellular form called an elementary body. The form that would be grown in tissue culture cells is the reticulate body. Elementary bodies (choice A) are the infectious form but are metabolically inactive and cannot be cultured. Gram-negative diplococcus (choice B) describes Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can cause ophthalmia neonatorum but would not cause pannus formation and scarring.

This child has floppy-baby syndrome, caused by ingestion of the spores of Clostridium botulinum, germination of the organism in the gut of the infant, and subsequent production of the botulinum toxin, which causes a flaccid paralysis by blocking release of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The genetic coding for production of this neurotoxin is found in the genome of a lysogenic phage, and therefore is produced only in virus-infected bacterial cells. Other medically important attributes that are encoded in this way include the cholera toxin, Shiga toxin, O antigen of Salmonella, the erythrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes, and the diphtheria toxin. The bacterial chromosome (choice A) is the location of all essential genes in the bacterium. Loss of any essential gene will result in the death of the organism. Although most exotoxins are encoded on bacterial plasmids, endotoxin production is chromosomally encoded. An episome (choice B) is a plasmid that has become stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome. This is the mechanism by which Hfr cells arise in nature but is not known to play a role in exotoxin production in bacteria. Plasmids (choice D) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that replicate autonomously and carry genes for most exotoxins, fertility factors, and most antibiotic resistances. The botulinum toxin, the erythrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes and the diphtheria toxin are not encoded on plasmids but in the genomes of lysogenic phages. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are capable of mediating their own movement within and between strands of DNA inside cells. Transposition is believed to be responsible for the arising of multiple-drug resistance plasmids but is not believed to play a role in exotoxin production."

    "question": "A newborn has a severe viral infection with involvement of the heart, liver, and brain. The illness resolves several weeks later. A viral culture of the throat is most likely to grow an organism that contains which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Double-stranded DNA",
      "B. Double-stranded RNA",
      "C. Single-stranded DNA",
      "D. single-stranded negative-sense RNA",
      "E. Single-stranded, positive-sense RNA"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common viral disease of children caused primarily by coxsackie virus. In infants, coxsackie A can cause disseminated disease involving multiple organs, but unlike cytomegalovirus (the most common cause of disseminated fetal infections in the U.S.), coxsackie virus infections will typically resolve without sequelae. The coxsackie viruses (as well as poliovirus, echoviruses, and rhinoviruses) are Picornaviruses that are composed of single-stranded linear positive-sense RNA. The virus particles are non-enveloped, 27-nm icosahedrons with 60 subunits that replicate in the cytoplasm. The mnemonic for remembering the Picornaviruses is 'PEECoRNA viruses': Polio, Entero, Echo, Coxsackie, Rhino, hep A. The mnemonic for remembering the positive-sense RNA viruses is 'Call Henry, Pico and Flo To Come Right away': Calicivirus, Hepevirus, Picornavirus, Flavivirus, Togavirus, Coronavirus, Retrovirus. Poxviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses have double-stranded DNA (choice A). Of these, molluscum contagiosum (poxvirus) causes umbilicated warts; herpes 6 causes roseola infantum, which is a mild febrile disease followed by a rash; and adenoviruses cause conjunctivitis, pharyngoconjunctivitis, upper respiratory disease, and gastroenteritis. None of these would be compatible with the stem in this case. Reoviruses have double-stranded RNA (choice B) and include rotaviruses which cause prolonged, watery diarrhea in infants. Parvoviruses have single-stranded DNA (choice C) and include B19 virus, the cause of erythema infectiosum (slapped cheek disease) in school age children. Orthomyxoviruses have single-stranded, negative-sense RNA (choice D) and include influenza virus, which causes fever, myalgia, cough, and malaise."

His rectal temperature is 38.8°C (101.6°F), and he smells of wine His coughing produces thick, bloody sputum. Physical examination shows dullness to percussion, increased vocal fremitus, decreased breath sounds, and wet crackles over the right lung field A chest x-ray shows consolidation of the right upper lobe Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus",
      "B. A gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus",
      "C. A gram-negative, pleomorphic bacillus requiring factors X and V",
      "D. A gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus",
      "E. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This man has pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae as suggested by his alcoholism, lobar consolidation, and 'currant jelly' sputum. Klebsiella is a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae, so it is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus. A gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus (choice B) describes Pseudomonas aeruginosa which may cause pneumonia but would be more likely in a patient with cystic fibrosis than in an alcoholic. The sputum would have a blue-green color and a fruity odor. A gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus requiring factors X and V (choice C) describes Haemophilus influenzae. It is a cause of pneumonia, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and otitis media, but does not typically cause lobar consolidation or bloody sputum. A gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus (choice D) describes the genus Streptococcus, of which S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in adults (including alcoholics). The sputum of streptococcal pneumonia, however is 'rusty' or tinged with brown blood, not bright red and gelatinous as described here. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus (choice E) describes the genus Staphylococcus, of which S. aureus is a common cause of pneumonia. It is most commonly associated with aspiration pneumonia in alcoholics but causes a salmon-colored sputum, not one that is bright red and gelatinous."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man comes to the physician because of chronic, symmetric arthritis of the knees. He developed an extensive rash after a deer-hunting trip several years ago. He says that he felt 'sick' at that time, and developed knee pain that prevented him from climbing stairs for several months, but the pain has partially resolved. Which of the following is likely to be part of this patient's past medical history?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aplastic crisis",
      "B. Bell palsy",
      "C. Erythema nodosum",
      "D. Pharyngitis",
      "E. Urethral discharge"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This history is characteristic for Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The clues are deer, rash, knees, and acute arthritis followed by chronic arthritis. The first sign of disease is typically a migrating red rash in the shape of concentric rings (erythema migrans), and this stage is frequently followed by neurologic symptoms such as Bell palsy. This may be followed by signs of cardiac arrhythmia or pericarditis, and finally by arthritis and arthralgias, which are believed to be immune complex-mediated. Aplastic crisis (choice A) is caused by parvovirus B19 in patients with sickle-cell anemia. It is not associated with Lyme disease. Erythema nodosum (choice C) or desert bumps, are caused by Coccidioides immitis in the desert of the U.S. Southwest. These symptoms are not associated with Lyme disease. Pharyngitis (choice D) is not a common finding in Lyme disease, although other influenza-like symptoms may occur, such as fever, chills, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and musculoskeletal pain. Urethral discharge (choice E) would not be expected with Lyme disease, but if you thought the arthritis was caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, this answer would have been appropriate."

Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the lesion shows a tree-like proliferation of the epithelium associated with a fibrous stroma. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on a Pap smear?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cowdry type A inclusions",
      "B. Guarnieri bodies",
      "C. Koilocytes",
      "D. Negri bodies",
      "E. Owl's-eye inclusions"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV causes infected cells to have an enlarged nucleus and perinuclear vacuolization. These cells are called koilocytic cells, which are diagnostic for HPV. Cowdry type A inclusions (choice A) are diagnostic for herpesviruses. Herpes simplex virus causes vesicular lesions. Guarnieri bodies (choice B) are intracytoplasmic inclusions diagnostic for poxviruses. Of these, molluscum contagiosum can produce genital warts, but these warts are friable and umbilicated and would not have the fibrous stroma described here. Negri bodies (choice D) are diagnostic for rabies virus. They are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions in neurons, and would not be associated with warts. Owl's-eye inclusions (choice E) are basophilic intranuclear inclusions with clearing around them that are diagnostic for cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus is not associated with warts."

Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the mass shows multiple tiny oval forms within macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Blastomycosis",
      "B. Coccidioidomycosis",
      "C. Histoplasmosis",
      "D. Paracoccidioidomycosis",
      "E. Sporotrichosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Histoplasmosis is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus that grows as a mold in the wild but as a tiny yeast inside macrophages in humans. The disease is typically asymptomatic or mild enough to go undetected, but when symptomatic it presents with cough, fever and malaise. It is commonly seen in geographic areas surrounding the central riverbeds of the United States. The primary and secondary treatments of choice for uncomplicated histoplasmosis are itraconazole and fluconazole, respectively. More serious cases are treated with amphotericin B. Blastomycosis (choice A) is characterized by a larger, round, budding yeast form, seen free in the tissues. Coccidioidomycosis (choice B) is seen mainly in the desert parts of the southwestern United States. In the lungs, spherules containing endospores are seen. Paracoccidioidomycosis (choice D) is endemic in Latin America, especially in Brazil. The infected cells show a typical 'pilot's wheel' appearance due to multiple yeasts sprouting out of a single parent cell. Sporotrichosis (choice E) most often produces a localized cutaneous infection, following inoculation occurring in association with minor skin trauma during gardening."

    "question": "A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of multiple blister-like lesions on the glans of the penis. He has had 2 episodes of similar symptoms during the past 2 years. Physical examination shows tender, 3-to-4-mm vesicles on the shaft of the penis with no crusting, drainage, or bleeding There is also mild bilateral inguinal adenopathy Which of the following best describes the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. The agent becomes latent in B cells",
      "B. The agent becomes latent in mononuclear cells",
      "C. The agent becomes latent in the dorsal root ganglia",
      "D. The agent becomes latent in the sacral ganglia",
      "E. The agent becomes latent in trigeminal ganglia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is a classic example of an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV, probably type 2). This agent causes lytic infections in mucoepithelial cells. It then moves by retrograde transport into neurons of the sacral ganglia, where it lies dormant during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. The Tzanck smear is a diagnostic test involving the touching of a microscope slide to a vesicular lesion. Multinucleated giant cells will be lifted off onto the slide and can be stained and identified as having a herpesvirus origin. B cells (choice A) are the site of latency for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Mononuclear cells (choice B) are the site of latency for cytomegalovirus (CMV). The dorsal root ganglia (choice C) are the sites of latency for varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles. Since the present lesions are on the genitalia, the virus would move into latency in the sacral ganglia, not the trigeminal ganglia (choice E). HSV introduced into the oral mucosa becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglia."

    "question": "An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of crampy abdominal pain, nausea, and mild diarrhea for the past 2 weeks. Her mother states that the girl vomited a 10-cm (4-inch) long cylindrical white worm 24 hours ago. Which of the following best describes the most likely route of infection in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Autoinfection",
      "B. Ingestion of cysts in contaminated water",
      "C. Ingestion of eggs from an infected pet",
      "D. Ingestion of eggs from human feces",
      "E. Mosquito transmission of larvae",
      "F. Skin penetration of larvae"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is a case of Ascaris lumbricoides infection, the only helminth infection caused by a cylindrical white worm of this remarkably large size. It is acquired directly with no intermediate host, from fecal contamination from other human beings, and the stage of the life cycle that is transmitted is the egg. Autoinfection (choice A) is a rare occurrence in helminthic infections, possible only with Strongyloides stercoralis (the threadworm), Enterobius vermicularis (the pinworm), and Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm). Ingestion of cysts in contaminated water (choice B) is the normal mechanism of infection used by intestinal protozoa. There are no helminthic infections in the United States that are transmitted via cysts in water. Ingestion of eggs from an infected pet (choice C) occurs in visceral larva migrans when the ascarids of dogs and cats infect the human, an aberrant host. It would never result in the introduction of an adult worm into the vomitus, as described here. Mosquito transmission of larvae (choice E) is a means of transmission of the filarial nematodes, none of which are found in the United States and none of which would be found in vomitus. Skin penetration of larvae (choice F) is the mechanism of infection used by hookworms, threadworms, and schistosomes. None of these helminths would fit the description of the worm that was recovered in this case, since none of these is larger than 1 cm in length."

    "question": "A 16-year-old girl who is an exchange student from Panama is brought to the emergency department by her host family because of a high-grade fever and delirium She has had 2 episodes of similar symptoms during the past 2 years. A peripheral blood smear shows Schüffner dots in enlarged erythrocytes containing oval bodies. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Babesia microti",
      "B. Plasmodium falciparum",
      "C. Plasmodium malariae",
      "D. Plasmodium ovale",
      "E. Plasmodium vivax"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The description of Schüffner dots tells us this patient is infected with Plasmodium vivax or ovale malaria. Schüffner dots are morphologic changes that occur in infected host erythrocytes, are visible by light microscopy in Romanovsky-stained blood smears, and appear as multiple brick-red dots. Both P. vivax and P. ovale (choice D) are capable of causing relapse following recovery from the primary infection. Both organisms leave dormant forms in the liver, called hypnozoites. Of these two, however, only P. vivax occurs in the western hemisphere. P. falciparum and P. malariae (choices B and C) do not possess these dormant forms and thus are incapable of causing relapses, but if drug treatment of the erythrocytic stages is inadequate the symptoms can 'recrudesce' due to renewed multiplication in the bloodstream. Relapses and recrudescences look the same symptomatically, because once parasites begin multiplying again in the bloodstream, the cyclic fevers return. Babesia microti (choice A) causes malaria-like symptoms and is transmitted by the same tick that spreads Lyme disease. It does not occur in Panama."

The causal agent produces a toxin with a mechanism of action that is closest to the mechanism of action of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus",
      "B. Diphtheria toxin",
      "C. Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
      "D. Labile toxin of Escherichia coli",
      "E. Pertussis toxin",
      "F. Verotoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae. The voluminous 'rice-water' stools described in the question result from the action of the cholera enterotoxin. Cholera enterotoxin acts by activating adenylate cyclase by ADP ribosylation of a GTP-binding protein in small intestinal crypt cells, turning on massive secretion of isotonic fluid. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli produce a toxin very similar to cholera toxin, the heat-labile toxin. The alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus (choice A) is a pore-forming toxin that punches holes in cellular membranes. Diphtheria toxin (choice B) acts by ribosylating eukaryotic elongation factor-2 and thereby inhibiting eukaryotic protein synthesis. Its binding component targets heart, nerve, and epithelial cells. Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (choice C) acts very similarly to the diphtheria toxin, inhibiting elongation factor-2, but targeting liver cells. Pertussis toxin (choice E) causes edema by ADP-ribosylating Gi, the inhibitory subunit of G protein, thus increasing cyclic AMP. Verotoxin (choice F) is produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and acts in a mechanism similar to that of the Shiga toxin, shutting down eukaryotic protein synthesis by clipping the 60S ribosomal subunit."

Which of the following is the most important pathogenic property of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Biofilm production",
      "B. Endotoxin production",
      "C. Intracellular habitat",
      "D. Novobiocin resistance",
      "E. Superantigen action"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common cause of infections involving catheters and prosthetic devices is Staphylococcus epidermidis. Materials left in the body for prolonged periods of time are almost always coated with Teflon™, which is so slippery that most organisms cannot adhere and cause infections there. S. epidermidis is capable of initiating infection even on Teflon-coated surfaces because it produces a biofilm that alters the surface tension of liquids around itself. Endotoxin production (choice B) is not an attribute of S. epidermidis. Endotoxin, or lipopolysaccharide is a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. S. epidermidis is a gram-positive organism. Intracellular habitat (choice C) is not an attribute of S. epidermidis. Staphylococci are extracellular bacteria. Novobiocin resistance (choice D) is exhibited by S. saprophyticus but not S. epidermidis, and it is a diagnostic aid, not a pathogenicity factor. Superantigen action (choice E) is expressed by the exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but it does not contribute to the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis."

      "A. Bacillus anthracis",
      "B. Salmonella enterica subsp. typhi",
      "C. Shigella sonnei",
      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Yersinia pestis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The child has shigellosis (bacillary dysentery), which is an acute infection of the bowel that can be caused by a variety of Shigella organisms, including S. flexneri, S. sonnei (the most common isolate in the United States), S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae. The organism is spread via the fecal-oral route by contaminated food or inanimate objects; spread in contaminated water is unusual. Epidemics commonly occur in crowded populations with poor sanitation. Mini-epidemics have occurred in the daycare setting. The presentation given here is typical; adults may have a slower presentation. Diagnosis is important because untreated children may die (of dehydration and circulatory collapse) in the first 12 days. Fluid replacement is the most critical aspect of therapy and may require IV fluids in severe cases. The condition resolves spontaneously; use of antibiotics (TMP-SMX) may shorten duration. Bacillus anthracis (choice A) causes anthrax, which can produce skin infection and pneumonia. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi (choice B) causes typhoid fever, which differs from shigellosis because it is an enteric fever with more prominent systemic symptoms. Vibrio cholerae (choice D) causes cholera, with characteristic 'rice-water stool' diarrhea. Yersinia pestis (choice E) causes plague, with prominent lymph node and lung involvement."

      "E. A gram-positive, coagulase-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This is a case of ecthyma gangrenosum, the hallmark lesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. It is a common nosocomial infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, or severe burns. P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-positive, aerobic (a nonfermenter), and catalase-positive. It is a prodigious producer of a capsule (slime layer) and is also distinguished by its production of a blue-green pigment and a grapelike odor. Bacillus is a gram-positive aerobic, spore-forming rod (choice B). Superficially, the skin lesion of anthrax (the anthrax eschar) might resemble the lesion caused by Pseudomonas but would not be a common finding in burn patients and indeed is quite rare in the United States. Clostridium is an anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive rod (choice C). Clostridium would not be a common pathogen in burn patients and would not cause such a lesion. A gram-positive, coagulase-negative coccus (choice D) could be Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus or any of the members of the genus Streptococcus. None of these agents would be likely to produce a lesion such as the one shown. Staph. epidermidis is a member of the normal skin flora and is best known for its ability to colonize intravenous catheters and the endocardium via its production of a biofilm. Staph. saprophyticus is best known as an agent of urinary tract infection in young, sexually active women, and the streptococci cause a wide variety of diseases, such as pharyngitis, meningitis, cellulitis, and endocarditis. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive coagulase-positive coccus (choice E). It is a member of the normal skin flora and causes abscesses, furuncles and boils, but not the lesion shown in the image here."

Which of the following is most likely responsible for the skin rash?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Hyaluronic acid capsule",
      "D. M protein",
      "E. Pyrogenic exotoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The rash described is that of scarlet fever, which can be a complication of streptococcal sore throat (as in this question) or streptococcal wound infection. In past centuries, scarlet fever was a major childhood disease that often caused death, but it has become much less common (possibly as a result of early antibiotic therapy) and is now only a rare cause of death. The fever and rash in this disease are due to the pyrogenic exotoxin, which is phage-encoded. The alpha toxins (choice A) of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are cytolysins. The alpha toxin of S. aureus is a pore former, and that of C. perfringens is a lecithinase. Endotoxin (choice B) is found in gram-negative organisms. Endotoxin directly activates macrophages to overproduce IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and causes gram-negative shock. Hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein (choices C and D) are both found in Streptococcus pyogenes, but are not responsible for the fever and rash seen in the present case. The hyaluronic acid capsule is non-immunogenic and makes it difficult for the immune system to recognize the infection. M protein is an anti-phagocytic surface protein."

      "D. Phenelzine",
      "E. Succinylcholine"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Botulism is caused by a protein toxin produced by the gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin type A is also available commercially as the compound OnabotulinumtoxinA. Botulinum toxin selectively cleaves the docking proteins for acetylcholine (ACh) exocytosis. As a result, there is decreased ACh transmission in all parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions and decreased sympathetic cholinergic transmission in sweat glands and neuromuscular junctions. Mydriasis is a result of decreased ACh activity on muscarinic receptors in parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions. Skeletal muscle weakness results from decreased ACh stimulation of nicotinic receptors in neuromuscular junctions. Skeletal muscle weakness is the differentiating feature between anticholinergic agents (i.e., atropine) and botulinum toxin. Serious adverse effects of botulinum toxin type A include respiratory compromise, development or worsening of acute angle-closure glaucoma, brachial plexopathy, dysphonia, muscle weakness, and anticholinergic side effects. Atropine (choice A), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, causes tachycardia, mydriasis, and elevated body temperature but does not cause muscle weakness. Ephedrine (choice C) is an indirect sympathomimetic and causes tachycardia, mydriasis, and possibly elevated body temperature from increased metabolic rate. It would not cause diffuse muscle weakness, however. Phenelzine (choice D), an MAO inhibitor, would also enhance the sympathetic system but with no effects on skeletal muscle. Succinylcholine (choice E), a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, causes muscle weakness but none of the other symptoms."

Physical examination of the buccal and nasal mucosa shows an adherent membrane. Gram stain of the oral secretions from most of the patients shows gram-positive rods. The toxins produced by the causal organism most likely interfere with which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transcription initiation",
      "B. Transcription elongation",
      "C. Transcription termination",
      "D. Translation initiation",
      "E. Translation elongation",
      "F. Translation termination"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Although now rare in the United States due to vaccination programs, diphtheria is a serious disease with fatality rates between 5 and 10% in adults. The disease is an upper respiratory tract infection characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent pseudomembrane on the tonsil, pharynx, and/or nose. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a facultatively anaerobic gram-positive bacterium. Diphtheria toxin inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) in eukaryotic cells via ADP-ribosylation. The inactivation of eEF-2 inhibits cell protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. This directly affects translation elongation. Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin primarily targets the heart, nerves, and epithelium. Transcription initiation (choice A) and elongation (choice B) may be affected by drugs that target RNA polymerase, such as rifampin. These drugs are mainly used for mycobacteria. Transcription termination (choice C) is usually determined by chromatin structure, such as pin-loops. It is not generally easily targeted for inhibition by toxins or drugs. Translation initiation (choice D) may be affected by certain antimicrobials such as aminoglycosides. Translation termination (choice F) is not generally a target of toxins."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is diagnosed with urinary tract obstruction and undergoes surgical correction. An indwelling urinary catheter is in place and two days later, the patient develops a urinary tract infection. Cultures of the urine grow non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rods. The most likely causal organism also causes which of the following illnesses?",
    "options": [
      "A. Esophagitis in AIDS patients",
      "B. Hot-tub folliculitis",
      "C. Neonatal septicemia",
      "D. Pneumonia in AIDS patients",
      "E. Staghorn calculi in the urinary tract"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that produces blue-green pigments. It can easily be distinguished from the family Enterobacteriaceae because Pseudomonas is oxidase-positive. It is an opportunistic pathogen that has an increased chance of causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients who have indwelling catheters or who are on antibiotics. Pseudomonas is an agent of hot-tub folliculitis in normal patients using contaminated spas, and causes infections in burn patients and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. Esophagitis in AIDS patients (choice A) can be caused by Candida albicans. This is a yeast that can cause urinary tract infections in poorly controlled diabetics because glucose in the urine enhances its growth. Neonatal septicemia (choice C) is most frequently caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes. Of these, S. agalactiae is a gram-positive coccus and L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod; and although E. coli is a gram-negative rod, it is oxidase-negative and lactose-fermenting. E. coli is the most common cause of UTI overall. Pneumonia in AIDS patients (choice D) is caused by a variety of organisms, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis and Pneumocystis jiroveci. None of these is a gram-negative bacillus. Staghorn calculi in the urinary tract (choice E) are formed during infections with urease-positive organisms such as Proteus and Ureaplasma. Proteus is a gram-negative rod but is oxidase-negative, and Ureaplasma is a cell wall-less prokaryote related to Mycoplasma that would not stain at all with Gram stain."

      "A. Common core polysaccharide",
      "B. Lecithinase",
      "C. Lipid A",
      "D. O-specific polysaccharide",
      "E. Peptidoglycan"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Septic shock is a feared, potentially fatal complication of systemic infection with a wide variety of gram-negative organisms. The primary toxic agent is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Further, it has been established that the most toxic part of the LPS is lipid A. The pathophysiologic effects of LPS are related to triggering the release of potent cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor) from macrophages and activation of coagulation cascades. Common core polysaccharide (choice A) is a portion of the LPS that is the same in all gram-negative bacteria. The polysaccharide component of LPS is the immunogenic component. It is not the most important factor in pathogenesis. Lecithinase (choice B) is an enzyme produced by Clostridium perfringens that damages cell membranes. O-specific polysaccharide (choice D) is a portion of the LPS that induces specific immunity. Peptidoglycan (choice E) is found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and can be indirectly linked to LPS."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient became symptomatic with prolonged diarrhea, which is common in AIDS patients. All of the agents on the list are common causes of diarrhea in AIDS, but the only one that would produce acid-fast oocysts of this size in the stool is Cryptosporidium. Adenovirus (choice A) is a viral cause of diarrhea in AIDS. Viruses are minute in size compared to bacteria and eukaryotes, and would not be visible by standard microscopy of the stool. Listeria (choice C) is a gram-positive bacterium. Most bacteria measure less than 2 microns in size. Mycobacterium avium complex (choice D) commonly presents in AIDS patients with diarrhea, fever, and wasting. Although the organism is acid-fast, it is a bacterium that is intracellular, and as such its size is much smaller than that of a eukaryote. Salmonella (choice E) is a common cause of diarrhea in AIDS, but it is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacterium that would be about 2 μm in diameter."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This child has neonatal infection with Escherichia coli. The most important pathogenic attribute of the strains that cause neonatal disease is the K1 capsule that prevents phagocytosis. Most of the strains that cause this have the K1 serotype. E. coli is the most common gram-negative rod that infects children from maternal contamination as they pass through the birth canal. Beta hemolysis (choice A) is an attribute of some strains of urotropic E. coli but is not a major factor in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Biofilm production (choice B) is an attribute of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and enteroaggregative E. coli, but is not believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Exotoxin production (choice C) is involved in enterotoxigenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli pathogenesis, but is not believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Motility (choice E) is an important pathogenic mechanism among the agents of urinary tract infection because it gives them the ability to enter the bladder against the flow of urine. It is not believed to be important in the pathogenesis of neonatal disease caused by E. coli."

      "D. Dog bite",
      "E. Endogenous flora"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has pseudoappendicitis, and Yersinia enterocolitica is the pathogen that produces this clinical syndrome. Yersinia is transmitted to patients via the oral route, most commonly from contaminated milk, and occasionally, from blood transfusion. Y. enterocolitica is associated with cooler climates since it grows well at less than body temperature. Arthropod vectors (choice A) are not involved in transmission of Y. enterocolitica. Arthropods such as ticks transmit tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. Insects such as mosquitoes transmit viral encephalitides and malaria. Contaminated ground beef (choice B) is involved in the transmission of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), but is not a common source of infection with Y. enterocolitica. Dog bite (choice D) is not involved in the transmission of Y. enterocolitica. Dogs may transmit rabies, Capnocytophaga or Pasteurella. Endogenous transmission (choice E) is important in the formation of intestinal abscesses by anaerobic normal flora organisms, but is not believed to be involved with Y. enterocolitica transmission."

    "options": [
      "A. Activation of macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines",
      "B. Block release of acetylcholine",
      "C. Block release of GABA and glycine",
      "D. Increasing levels of cAMP",
      "E. Inhibition of protein synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This boy is displaying the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis with bronchiectasis (accounting for the foul-smelling sputum) and pancreatic insufficiency producing steatorrhea. However, the question directly relates to the infectious agent causing the pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an oxidase-positive bacterium with a fruity aroma. Pseudomonas produces blue-green pigments that act as siderophores when grown in an iron-limited environment, but are often colorless on blood agar. P. aeruginosa is a strictly aerobic, gram-negative rod that produces an exotoxin (exotoxin A) that ADP-ribosylates, and therefore inhibits, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2), which is a G protein involved in the eukaryotic translation of proteins. Activation of macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines (choice A) is the mechanism by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes damage. This is an endotoxin and is not to be confused with an exotoxin. Blocking release of acetylcholine (choice B) is specific for Clostridium botulinum which produces a neurotoxin that causes a flaccid paralysis. Blocking release of GABA and glycine (choice C) is specific for Clostridium tetani which produces a neurotoxin that causes a spastic paralysis. Increasing levels of cAMP (choice D) refers to the toxins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Vibrio cholerae, Bordetella pertussis and Bacillus anthracis. These exotoxins each increase cellular fluid loss, leading to the causation of edema or diarrhea."

    "options": [
      "A. Hydrops fetalis",
      "B. Necrotizing encephalitis",
      "C. Patent ductus arteriosus",
      "D. Pulmonary stenosis",
      "E. Retinochoroiditis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Toxoplasma gondii is capable of crossing the placenta and causing harmful fetal infection only during an acute maternal infection. During this period, rapidly dividing forms called tachyzoites can be spread via the bloodstream and thus cross the placenta. As soon as the maternal immune response is initiated, parasitemia ceases and the parasite can no longer enter the fetus. In a patient such as this one, occupational exposure to cats (the definitive host of the parasite) might be assumed. In the general U.S. population, however, it is more common to acquire the infection from poorly cooked pork. When the organism infects the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy there is little risk of fetal infection, but infections that do occur often involve serious damage to the central nervous system, e.g. necrotizing encephalitis, or disseminated disease. When the organism infects the mother in later trimesters the fetus has a greater likelihood of infection, but most of those infections will be asymptomatic. Hydrops fetalis (choice A) is a common consequence of fetal infection with the B19 virus, which infects immature erythrocytes. It may occur following in utero infection with Toxoplasma but it is not the most common sequela. Patent ductus arteriosus (choice C) and pulmonary stenosis (choice D) are aspects of congenital rubella syndrome, caused when rubella virus crosses the placenta. Retinochoroiditis (choice E) is a consequence of infection of second- and third-trimester fetuses with Toxoplasma gondii. It may also occur 20 to 30 years after birth in children born with asymptomatic Toxoplasma infections."

      "E. Gram-positive bacillus",
      "F. Gram-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. The clinical presentation and lumbar puncture suggests meningitis. The presence of numerous neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests a bacterial pathogen. The most common cause of neonatal meningitis is Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a gram-positive coccus. Acid-fast bacillus (choice A) describes a bacterium in the genus Mycobacterium. These bacteria are not causes of neonatal meningitis. Double-stranded DNA virus with nuclear membrane envelope (choice B) describes a virus in the herpesvirus family. Herpesviruses may cause encephalitis in newborns but would not be a likely cause of meningitis in this age group. A gram-negative bacillus (choice C) describes Escherichia coli among many others. E. coli is the second most common cause of neonatal meningitis. Gram-negative diplococcus (choice D) describes the genera Neisseria, Moraxella and Veillonella. Of these, Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis, but usually in adolescents and young adults. It would not be the most common cause of a neonatal presentation such as this one. Gram-positive bacillus (choice E) describes Listeria monocytogenes among others. Listeria is the third most common cause of neonatal meningitis in the United States."

Infection with which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cryptosporidium parvum",
      "B. Dientamoeba fragilis",
      "C. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "D. Giardia lamblia",
      "E. Isospora belli"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Entamoeba histolytica may produce asymptomatic infection or more severe disease characterized by mucosal ulcerations and submucosal spread causing abdominal distress and bloody stools. Stools may show either trophozoite forms or the typical spherical cysts. E. histolytica cysts characteristically are spherical in shape, are 10-20 μm in diameter and have granular cytoplasm containing up to four nuclei. Cryptosporidium parvum (choice A) infections occur in the immunocompromised population and may cause severe diarrhea. The organism presents as minute (2-5 μm) intracellular spheres or arc-shaped merozoites under normal mucosa, and can be difficult to see by light microscopy. Cysts in the stool are too small (4-5 μm) to be confused with Entamoeba. Dientamoeba fragilis (choice B) is an intestinal ameba that also may produce an infectious diarrhea. It does not have a cyst form, and only the trophozoite forms are seen in stools. Giardia lamblia (choice D) is a flagellate protozoan that infects the stomach and small intestine when contaminated water is ingested. Diagnosis is usually made by examining duodenal contents; however, the stools may contain the oval or elliptical cysts, which are thick-walled and measure 8-14 μm in diameter. Spherical cysts are not seen in Giardia infection, and giardial diarrheas are not bloody. Isospora belli (choice E) produces self-limited intestinal infections, mostly in the tropics, in which fever and diarrhea may last weeks to months. The stool-borne cysts are much larger than Entamoeba (30 by 15 μm), are asymmetrical, and are typically almond-shaped."

    "options": [
      "A. Multiple serotypes",
      "B. Negative-sense genome",
      "C. Spread by respiratory droplets",
      "D. Syncytia formation",
      "E. Viral hemagglutinin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The disease is mumps, caused by a paramyxovirus. In children, mumps causes a transient inflammation of the parotid glands, and less commonly, of the testes, pancreas, or central nervous system. Mumps tends to be a more severe disease in adults than in children. Mumps in adults involves the testes (causing orchitis) and pancreas with some frequency. The paramyxoviruses are negative-sense RNA viruses that spread from cell to cell by syncytia formation. This protects them from exposure to substances that exist extracellularly (such as antibodies) and makes cell-mediated immunity an absolutely essential event for recovery and cure. This is why the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine must be live-attenuated, to stimulate strong cell-mediated immunity. Multiple serotypes (choice A) of medical importance do not exist in mumps virus. The vaccine contains a single serotype. A negative-sense genome (choice B) is possessed by the Paramyxoviridae, but this attribute is not associated with the lack of efficacy of antibodies. The negative-sense genome causes these viruses to require a virion-associated polymerase for infectivity. It is true that the mumps virus is spread by respiratory droplets (choice C) - but this attribute does not have a relationship to making antibodies ineffective in cure. Many viruses that are spread by respiratory droplets can be prevented by an adequate IgA or IgG antibody response. Viral hemagglutinin (choice E) in the case of mumps virus exists in a complex with the neuraminidase molecule and thus is not found alone on the surface of the virion. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase complex is responsible for the attachment to cells via sialic acid residues and the release from the cell following the clipping off of sialic acid residues. Many viruses that have hemagglutinin-neuraminidase complexes on the surface of their membrane can be neutralized by antibodies, so this attribute does not contribute to the need for a cell-mediated immune response."

Out of 100 bacterial cultures subsequently tested, two cultures showed ampicillin resistance but failed to show viral cytolysis. Which of the following processes of DNA transfer most likely occurred in these two cultures?",
    "options": [
      "A. F+ to F- conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Hfr to F- conjugation",
      "D. Homologous recombination",
      "E. Site-specific recombination",
      "F. Specialized transduction",
      "G. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The mechanism involving transfer of bacterial DNA from cell to cell using a lytic phage as a vector is called generalized transduction. It occurs when bacterial DNA is accidentally captured into a phage head during the lytic virus life cycle and then transferred to another bacterial cell. If the recipient cell is capable of homologous recombination of the newly donated DNA, then that cell can acquire new genetic traits that will persist stably in its genome. F+ to F- conjugation (choice A) involves the transfer of a plasmid from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. The experimental situation described here does not involve two cells exchanging DNA, but rather a virus picking up DNA from one cell and transferring it to another. Hfr to F- conjugation (choice C) involves the transfer of chromosomal DNA from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. The experimental situation described here does not involve two cells exchanging DNA. Homologous recombination (choice D) is a process by which linear DNA that has been delivered into a new cell can be successfully recombined into the chromosome and stabilized for the next generation. It is not a mechanism of transfer of bacterial DNA, but rather a mechanism which allows for the protection of DNA transferred into another cell. Although homologous recombination is a necessary final step in all mechanisms of transfer of bacterial DNA with the exception of the F+ to F- cross, it is not the means by which a virus transfers DNA from cell to cell. Site-specific recombination (choice E) is a process by which circles of DNA may become integrated together. It occurs during the lysogenic viral life cycle, when transposons move within bacterial cells, and during the formation of the Hfr chromosome when a conjugative plasmid inserts itself into the bacterial genome. It is not a mechanism of transfer of DNA from cell to another. Specialized transduction (choice F) is the mechanism by which lysogenic (temperate) phages transfer DNA from one bacterium to another as an accident of the lysogenic viral life cycle. Viruses establish lysogeny by inserting their DNA into the bacterial chromosome by site-specific recombination. Later, if an error of excision occurs during induction, bacterial genes adjacent to the insertion site may be transferred. Since the virus that was added to cultures in this question was a lytic virus, it is not capable of performing this type of transduction. Transformation (choice G) is the process by which free bacterial DNA can be picked up by competent bacteria, imported, and integrated into the chromosome with homologous recombination. No viruses are involved in transformation."

      "D. Listeria monocytogenes",
      "E. Yersinia pestis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Any previously healthy person in the Southwestern United States who develops septic shock or severe pulmonary disease should be evaluated for plague. Plague is not an extinct disease but is still encountered in sporadic cases in various places in the world, including Asia, Africa, parts of Europe, and the U.S. Southwest. The causative organism is Yersinia pestis which is endemic in many wild-animal populations and can be transmitted to humans either by direct contact or by flea bite. Human plague may take many forms, including pestis minor (mild lymphadenopathy), bubonic plague (prominent hemorrhagic lymphadenopathy), pneumonic plague (as in this patient), and septicemic plague. The primary pneumonic form typically presents as described. Antibiotics are most effective if given within the first 24 hours, which can be problematic if medical staff does not suspect the disease. Since plague is rare in the United States, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required to make a rapid diagnosis and to institute timely treatment. If the diagnosis is missed, the mortality rate is quite high. Brucella abortus (choice A) causes brucellosis characterized by undulating fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Brucellosis occurs rarely in the United States, mainly in slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians and farmers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) causes gangrene and gastroenteritis. Francisella tularensis (choice C) causes tularemia, which is associated with a spectrum of manifestations from an influenza-like syndrome to adenopathy with ulceration at the site of inoculation. In the United States it occurs most commonly in hunters in Arkansas and Missouri. Listeria monocytogenes (choice D) causes listeriosis. Infection during pregnancy may result in sepsis, abortion, or premature delivery. Infection in the neonate may produce meningitis. In immunocompromised adults, either meningitis or sepsis may occur."

      "D. Inactivation of complement",
      "E. Protein A"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The tests mentioned reveal a gram-positive coccus with the characteristics of Staphylococcus (gram-positive cocci in grapelike clusters). The organism is beta-hemolytic (breaks hemoglobin down to a colorless product) and catalase-positive (produces water and oxygen gas from the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide). Production of a fibrin clot in a tube of animal serum reveals that the organism is coagulase-positive. The only organism that fits all of these criteria is Staphylococcus aureus. Staph. aureus evades phagocytosis by producing protein A, which binds to the Fc component of IgG, thus preventing opsonization. Capsules (choice A) of bacteria and fungi are antiphagocytic but this is not the means used by S. aureus to evade phagocytosis. Key encapsulated organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans. Diffuse fimbriate layers (choice B) of gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes cause adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. They do not protect against phagocytosis. IgA proteases (choice C) are produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae. They do not protect against phagocytosis, although they do tend to prevent the bacteria that produce them from immediately being shed from the mucosal surfaces. Inactivation of complement (choice D) is a mechanism used by Strep. pneumoniae to protect itself against opsonization."

Gram-negative rods, lactose fermenters (choice D), describes Escherichia coli which is usually associated with salads, unwashed fruits, and hamburger, not with eating undercooked seafood. This bacterium uses the human colon as a reservoir. It is often transmitted via the fecal oral route. Gram-negative rods, non-lactose fermenters, H₂S-positive (choice E) describes Salmonella and Proteus. Salmonella is most commonly acquired from poultry products, and Proteus is associated with urinary tract infections."

    "question": "A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician because of burning on urination and increased urinary frequency. Culture of the urine grows 10⁵ colony-forming units of gram-positive cocci/mL. Sensitivity testing using the Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion test shows that the isolate is resistant to ciprofloxacin. Which of the following is the most likely location of this drug-resistance gene?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chromosome",
      "B. Conjugative plasmid",
      "C. Episome",
      "D. Nonconjugative plasmid",
      "E. Prophage"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has cystitis caused by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Quinolones inhibit DNA synthesis, recombination, and repair by inhibiting DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV. The genes encoding resistance to quinolones are primarily chromosomally encoded and involve mutations in the structural genes for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase type IV. It also involves decreased drug uptake caused by mutations in genes that regulate membrane permeability. Another minor mechanism involved in quinolone resistance, which is encoded by plasmids, consists of the overexpression of a pumping mechanism that actively exports the drug. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone whose main mechanism of resistance is chromosomally mediated. Conjugative plasmids (choice B) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that are capable of mediating their own transfer from cell to cell via conjugation. Although they are a very common source of drug-resistance genes, they are not involved in the majority of the cases of resistance to quinolones. Episomes (choice C) are plasmids that have been integrated into the chromosome of the bacterial cell. Genes encoding quinolone resistance are not known to exist in episome form. Nonconjugative plasmids (choice D) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that do not contain the tra operon. They are not involved in quinolone resistance. Prophages (choice E) are temperate bacteriophages that have integrated their DNA into the chromosome of the bacterial cell. Although abnormal excision can cause bacteriophages of this type to transfer drug-resistance genes the prophage DNA, by itself does not include the drug-resistance genes."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman who recently emigrated from Africa develops thick, erythematous nodules on the ears and nose with significant associated sensory loss. The nodules have grown slowly over the course of many years. Biopsy of the lesions shows dermal granulomas with giant cells and a few acid-fast bacteria. Cultures on blood agar and Lowenstein-Jensen medium show no growth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cutaneous leishmaniasis",
      "B. Lepromatous leprosy",
      "C. Onchocerciasis",
      "D. Rhinoscleroma",
      "E. Smallpox",
      "F. Tuberculoid leprosy"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Mycobacterium leprae is endemic to parts of Africa, Asia, and South America. Tuberculoid leprosy is an indolent disease, typically affecting cooler parts of the body (such as the nose and ears) producing dermal granulomas with rare, acid-fast bacilli and damage to peripheral nerves. This is in marked contrast to lepromatous leprosy, which is progressive, invasive and generally characterized by the presence of numerous acid-fast bacteria in a histiocytic but nongranulomatous tissue response. M. leprae has not been successfully grown on artificial media. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (choice A) is due to Leishmania species that show a worldwide distribution. The infection is transmitted through a sandfly bite, and the skin lesion is typically ulcerated. Histology shows intracellular parasites within the dermis and epidermis. Granulomas are not formed. Lepromatous leprosy (choice B) is the form of disease when the wrong T-helper (TH) cell is activated. Because TH2 cells stimulate antibody production, they have no value against an intracellular pathogen, and the patient develops disfiguring disseminated disease. Onchocerciasis (choice C) or river blindness, is a roundworm infection transmitted by blackflies of Africa and South America. The microfilariae grow at the site of inoculation and cause an inflamed subcutaneous nodule. The organism is seen on tissue sections. Rhinoscleroma (choice D) is a destructive granulomatous infection of the nasopharynx and is caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. Gram-negative rods can be cultured from the lesions. Smallpox (choice E), the infection caused by the variola virus (a DNA poxvirus) produces malaise, headaches, and a macular/pustular rash involving the face and distal extremities. Smallpox has been eradicated through worldwide vaccination."

    "options": [
      "A. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "B. Colorado tick fever virus",
      "C. Francisella tularensis",
      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. West Nile virus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The combination of a 1-week incubation period and the intraerythrocytic parasites strongly suggests Babesia microti as the infecting organism. The clinical disease is called babesiosis. The infecting protozoan is related to Plasmodium and is transmitted by the bite of the Ixodes scapularis tick. Occasional cases have been transmitted by blood transfusions. Most patients are asymptomatic; symptomatic cases in reasonably healthy individuals have the features described in the question stem. Rare severe cases, which may be fatal, may develop in severely debilitated or asplenic individuals and can be accompanied by severe hemolysis (up to 30% of red blood cells may have the parasites) with subsequent hemoglobinuria, hemolysis, and renal failure. Ixodes ticks are potential vectors of Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi) and Anaplasma (formerly Ehrlichia) phagocytophila (the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis). Colorado tick fever virus (choice B), Francisella tularensis (choice C) and Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) are all transmitted by the Dermacentor tick, not the Ixodes tick. West Nile encephalitis virus (choice E) is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes."

    "question": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive muscular weakness and poor head control. The mother says that she feeds the boy a soy-based formula sweetened with honey. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is ingestion of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. A gram-positive vegetative bacillus",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Exotoxin",
      "D. Neurotoxin",
      "E. Spores"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This baby has infant botulism (floppy-baby syndrome), which is due to germination of Clostridium botulinum spores in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. This disorder is most common in children under the age of 6 months. Older children and adults do not appear to be vulnerable to this form of botulism, but are susceptible to botulism caused by ingestion of preformed toxin. Floppy-baby syndrome is acquired following the ingestion of spores of the organism. A gram-positive vegetative bacillus (choice A) describes C. botulinum, but it is not ingestion of the vegetative bacteria that causes this condition. Endotoxin (choice B), or lipopolysaccharide, is found on all gram-negative bacteria; and C. botulinum is a gram-positive rod. Exotoxin (choice C) could describe any secreted toxin, including neurotoxins, but again this infant's condition was not an intoxication and was not due to ingestion of any kind of toxin directly. A neurotoxin (choice D) describes tetanospasmin or botulinum toxin, which is produced by C. tetani or C. botulinum respectively. Tetanus toxin causes a rigid paralysis due to the inhibition of glycine and GABA at inhibitory synapses. The present case is one of infant botulism, which was not due to ingestion of a preformed toxin or an intoxication as is adult botulism."

      "B. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi",
      "C. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Yersinia enterocolitica"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Yersinia enterocolitica is an important cause of 'mini-epidemics' of pediatric diarrhea. Outbreaks are common in colder climates and the organism can be grown well at 4°C (39.2°F). Adults can also be affected, but less commonly than children. Some diarrheal cases are severe (and occasionally fatal) and may be complicated by severe dysentery, appendicitis, or chronic relapsing ileocolitis that may require antibiotics (quinolone, third-generation cephalosporin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) to shorten the course. Helicobacter pylori (choice A) is an important cause of gastritis and ulcers. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi (choice B) causes typhoid fever. It is not common in the United States, but symptoms of infection include fever, abdominal rash and splenomegaly. Diarrhea is not a consistent feature. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice C) usually causes respiratory infections rather than diarrhea. Vibrio cholerae (choice D) causes cholera. It is not a common cause of diarrhea in day-care centers in the United States but is normally associated with massive environmental doses of bacteria in contaminated water. Patients with cholera have severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."

      "F. Poultry dishes",
      "G. Rare red meat dishes",
      "H. Rice dishes",
      "I. Smoked fish",
      "J. Soft cheeses"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. This case history and culture characteristics describe a typical gastroenteritis due to Campylobacter jejuni, the most common bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. Contaminated poultry or poultry products are responsible for more than 60% of all infections. Carriers (choice A) are not known to occur with Campylobacter, and are best known with Salmonella typhi. Typhoid fever is an enteric fever that presents with fever, lymphadenopathy and constipation. Custard and potato-salad dishes (choice B) would be the most likely source if the agent was Staphylococcus aureus, but this would have had an onset of 2 hours, and a gram-positive coccus would have been the cause. Milk and cream (choice C) might contain Listeria or Mycobacterium bovis, but Listeria is a gram-positive rod and Mycobacterium is an acid-fast rod. Both may cause a minor gastroenteritis in healthy adults but would be unlikely to present with blood in the stool. Poorly canned green vegetables (choice D) are the usual source of Clostridium botulinum, which would cause a flaccid paralysis. Clostridium is a genus of gram-positive rods. Poorly washed salad greens (choice E) could be sources of infection with multiple agents such as Escherichia coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella or Shigella. The E. coli strains which cause non-bloody diarrhea are usually associated with travel out of the home country (traveler's diarrhea). E. coli is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-negative. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that does not occur commonly in the United States but instead requires travel to a tropical country, and Salmonella and Shigella would be more likely to cause frankly bloody stools. Both are gram-negative rods that are oxidase-negative. Rare red meat dishes (choice G) would be good sources for Escherichia coli or Trichinella spiralis. E. coli is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod and Trichinella is a nematode. The serotype of E. coli associated with rare meat dishes in the United States causes bloody diarrhea without leukocytes. Trichinosis causes myalgia, fever, eosinophilia, splinter hemorrhages and periorbital edema. Rice dishes (choice H) are most frequently incriminated in the transmission of Bacillus cereus, which has a 1-to-2-hour onset of vomiting followed by diarrhea. Bacillus is a genus of gram-positive rods. Smoked fish (choice I) is a common source of Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive spore-forming rod that would produce a flaccid paralysis. Soft cheeses (choice J) are a common source of Listeria monocytogenes, which is a gram-positive rod that causes mild gastroenteritis."

She states that she emigrated from Southeast Asia and that three years ago, she had fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice joint pains, and generalized skin lesions that slowly disappeared. Which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered to investigate the patient's past illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibody",
      "B. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM antibody",
      "C. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)",
      "D. IgM antibody to HBcAg",
      "E. IgM antibody to HBsAg"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The clinical signs suggest that this woman had hepatitis B three years ago, and the fact that she is now feeling better also suggests that she recovered from this infection. Since she is pregnant, it is necessary to find out if she still has the agent in her liver (chronic hepatitis B infection) by performing a test for HBsAg. This test will be negative if she has completely recovered from the disease, but it will be positive if she is a chronic carrier. Ordering CMV IgG antibody (choice A) would be of no value because the clinical signs of the disease she had 3 years ago do not match those of CMV, and CMV does not produce chronic infections. Quantitation of HAV IgM antibody (choice B) would be useless, since HAV only causes acute infection. Measurement of IgM antibody to HBcAg (choice D) would be of no value at this time. This antibody is positive in acute hepatitis B, but would no longer be positive in this case. Examination of IgM antibody to HBsAg (choice E) would be of no value at this time. This antibody would be formed early during the recovery from acute hepatitis B, and would class-switch to IgG later on in the disease."

      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Enterotoxin",
      "D. Neurotoxin",
      "E. superantigen toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The disease described is gas gangrene, which is caused by the spore-forming anaerobe Clostridium perfringens and other closely related species. These very dangerous bacteria particularly like to grow in necrotic vascular tissue, and they produce a variety of destructive enzymes and toxins. The toxin produced by C. perfringens that is most strongly associated with myonecrosis is the alpha toxin, which is a lecithinase (phospholipase C) that lyses erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells. This toxin mediates massive hemolysis, increased vascular permeability and bleeding, hepatotoxicity, bradycardia, and hypotension. In the laboratory, the action of the lecithinase can be observed in Nagler's reaction, in which strains of C. perfringens will lyse the lecithin in egg-yolk agar. Endotoxin (choice B) is lipopolysaccharide and is not found on gram-positive organisms such as Clostridium. Enterotoxins (choice C) are produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including C. perfringens but the vignette is clearly specific for myonecrosis and not gastroenteritis. Neurotoxins (choice D) are produced by other members of the genera Clostridium (C. tetanus and C. botulinum), but not by C. perfringens. Superantigen toxin (choice E) is specific for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and the pyrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes. These exotoxins cause fever, petechial rash, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy."

      "A. It captures a nuclear membrane envelope",
      "B. It replicates in the cytoplasm",
      "C. It replicates in the nucleus",
      "D. It utilizes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase",
      "E. It utilizes reverse transcriptase"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The lesions are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum, a typically benign and self-limited condition caused by a poxvirus. The disease can be transmitted either sexually or through direct nonsexual contact. Patients with advanced HIV infection may develop a severe, generalized, and persistent eruption, often involving the face and upper body. Molluscum contagiosum virus is a poxvirus that reproduces in the cytoplasm and produces intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Capturing a nuclear membrane envelope (choice A) and replication in the nucleus (choice C) are characteristics of Herpesviridae. This family includes herpes simplex 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster, herpes 6 and herpes 8. None of these agents cause umbilicated warts, although rashes may occur. Herpes simplex causes vesicular lesions on the mucosae and varicella causes an asynchronous pruritic rash (chickenpox) or a unilateral vesicular rash that follows a dermatome (shingles). Utilization of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (choice D) is characteristic of all RNA viruses. Utilization of reverse transcriptase (choice E) is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus. Reverse transcriptase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase."

      "C. Disseminated gonococcal infection",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",

The condition is characterized by itching and soreness, pain on intercourse, finding of pseudohyphae in vaginal secretions, and absence of a particular odor. Predisposing factors include a high vaginal pH, diabetes, and use of antibiotics. The increased vulnerability in diabetes may reflect increased glucose concentrations in vaginal secretions and relative immunosuppression. Crohn disease (choice A) can predispose for fistulas involving the vagina, rather than vulvovaginitis. Dissemination of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (choice C) can cause septic arthritis. The discharge of gonorrhea is leukorrheic and will contain neutrophils full of gram-negative diplococci. Neither rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) nor systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) is specifically associated with Candida vulvovaginitis."

      "C. Rice",
      "D. Salad greens",
      "E. Vacuum-packed fish"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This is a typical presentation of botulism, which is caused by the preformed toxin of Clostridium botulinum. Patients develop a progressive flaccid paralysis that can lead to death if the respiratory system is not adequately supported. Mentation is intact in these patients, and they do not exhibit sensory changes except for those related to failure of extraocular and intraocular muscles (e.g., diplopia, cycloplegia). The most common food sources implicated in botulism are canned alkaline vegetables and preserved fish. Since the genus Clostridium is anaerobic, materials packaged in the absence of oxygen will allow germination of the spores and the production of the toxin. Treatment is supportive. An antitoxin is available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) via state Health Departments, but may not be obtained early enough to be helpful. Most patients recover from food-borne botulism without any sequelae. Ground beef (choice A) is often implicated in transmission of Escherichia coli but is not involved in adult botulism. Poultry (choice B) is a common source of food poisoning caused by Campylobacter and Salmonella but is not a source of adult botulism. Rice (choice C) is a food often implicated in Bacillus cereus food poisoning, but not in adult botulism.

      "D. Rubeola",
      "E. Varicella zoster virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, or Fifth disease. Adults typically do not get the facial rash ('slapped cheek') typical of children, but have arthralgias and arthritis. The symmetrical distribution of involved joints is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis. The onset in adults is typically 3 to 4 weeks after exposure. Parvovirus infections may persist in immunosuppressed patients, resulting in red blood cell aplasia. B19 virus can cross the placenta and cause hydrops fetalis because it infects erythroid precursors, and has been linked to the aplastic crises of sickle cell anemia. Human herpesvirus type 6 (choice A) is the causative agent of roseola infantum, which is a common childhood illness that causes an extremely high fever; the fever subsides and then the child develops a lacy body rash. Rubella (choice C) is the German measles, which is sometimes called the three-day measles. Although the rash looks similar to that of rubeola (measles) the rubella rash is less intense than that of rubeola. Rubella is best known for its ability to cross the placenta and cause serious congenital defects. Rubeola (choice D) is the measles, which is characterized by the 3 C's (cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis) and photophobia, Koplik spots, and a maculopapular rash that begins below the ears and eventually spreads downward and also covers the face.

      "D. Sexual transmission",
      "E. Transplacental transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The lesions shown are ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, and in an AIDS patient, this is extremely suggestive of infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasmosis presents with seizures in 15-25% of cases. Because 70-80% of the world's population is seropositive, reactivational disease in the immunocompromised is extremely common. The disease is most commonly spread in the United States by ingestion of cysts from undercooked pork, but it can also be spread transplacentally or from cat feces. Tachyzoites develop intracellularly in phagocytic cells and then spread to the brain, muscle, and other tissues, where they encyst and multiply. Primary central nervous system lymphoma in AIDS patients can present clinically in nearly the same manner as toxoplasmosis, but the course is usually much more indolent. Fecal-oral contamination (choice B) is not the most common means of acquiring toxoplasmosis in the United States. Although cats serve as the necessary definitive host, and contamination with cat feces can cause infection, it is not the most common source in this country. Respiratory droplets (choice C) are not known to be a means of infection with T. gondii. Sexual transmission (choice D) is not known to occur in toxoplasmosis. Transplacental transmission (choice E) occurs with Toxoplasma in 2 to 6 out of every 1,000 live births.

      "E. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient most likely has herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. HSV-1 is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis in the United States, accounting for approximately 10% to 20% of the 20,000 viral encephalitis cases that occur annually. Viral encephalitis is characterized by elevated lymphocytes and erythrocytes in the CSF. HSV-1 encephalitis has a propensity for the temporal lobes of the brain. Other types of viral encephalitis typically affect older patients, occur in the summer months (because of mosquito transmission), and have no particular association to regions of the brain. Cowdry type A inclusions are intranuclear viral inclusion bodies that may be found in both neurons and glia and are characteristic of herpes simplex infection. The presence of both distinct nuclear and ill-defined cytoplasmic inclusions (choice A) specifically suggests cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV infection of the brain characteristically occurs in severely immunosuppressed patients, in whom it tends to localize to the paraventricular subependymal regions of the brain. Extracellular spirochetes (choice C) can sometimes be demonstrated in patients with neuroborreliosis, the brain infection seen in Lyme disease, and in neurosyphilis. Neuroborreliosis can cause aseptic meningitis, facial nerve palsies, and encephalopathy. Neurosyphilis can occur in three basic forms: meningovascular syphilis (involving the base of the brain), general paresis (involving the frontal lobe and other areas of the neocortex), and tabes dorsalis (involving the dorsal roots and spinal cord). Greatly enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with glassy amorphic viral inclusions (choice D) are a feature of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This viral encephalitis usually occurs in immunosuppressed patients and is caused by the JC polyomavirus. PML is characterized by demyelination because it preferentially infects oligodendroglia. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells (choice E) are characteristic of chronic HIV encephalitis, which tends to involve in particular the subcortical white matter, diencephalon, and brainstem."

Patients with AIDS are prone to a variety of opportunistic infections, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia represents one of the most common initial presentations. This organism is a ubiquitous atypical fungus that may cause a life-threatening acute interstitial pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. P. jiroveci appears as a cystlike organism with a characteristic cup shape that has been likened to a 'crushed tennis ball'. Methenamine silver staining allows its identification in bronchoalveolar lavage. A frothy exudate filling the alveolar cavities is a characteristic finding in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia. Pneumocystis has been classified as a fungus by ribosomal RNA analysis, but it is an unusual member of the group. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus (choice A) describes the genus Staphylococcus. Staphylococcus does not silver-stain and is not a common cause of dyspnea in AIDS patients. An encapsulated monomorphic fungus (choice B) describes the genus Cryptococcus. This genus causes dangerous meningitis in the immunocompromised person, but is not a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS. An intracellular parasitic protozoan (choice D) describes Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasma may cause encephalitis in AIDS patients, but it would not be expected to cause pneumonia. An intracellular yeast (choice E) describes Histoplasma capsulatum. This agent causes acute and chronic pulmonary disease in AIDS patients, but would not produce methenamine silver-staining cysts."

    "question": "A B-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because of a severe sore throat. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). Physical examination shows an erythematous posterior oropharynx with obvious abscesses on the tonsillar pillars, A rapid antigen test for Streptococcus pyogenes is positive. A beta-lactam antibiotic will have greatest efficacy at which of the following stages shown in the diagram?",
    "options": ["A. A", "B. B", "C. C", "D. D", "E. E", "F. F", "G. G"],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. In the bacterial growth curve, rapid exponential growth occurs during the log (or logarithmic growth) phase. Within this period, the generation time equals the time it takes for one cell to divide into two. Beta-lactam drugs act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. In a bacterial culture, cell wall synthesis will occur at a maximal rate during the period of exponential growth, which is marked on the graph by the letter C. The lag phase (choice A) is the initial phase of a bacterial culture during which there is no increase in cell number. Cells in a culture at this stage are activating enzymes necessary for metabolism, but are not undergoing cell wall synthesis. Choice B indicates the initial phase of bacterial multiplication, when cell division has not yet reached a maximum. Although cell wall synthesis would indeed make such cells sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics, it is not the period of maximum sensitivity. Choice D indicates the phase of the bacterial growth curve when toxic metabolic products begin to accumulate and nutrient levels begin to be insufficient to support continued growth. New cell wall synthesis would begin to fall at this point. The stationary phase (choice E) is a period of the bacterial growth curve when the number of bacteria dividing in the culture equals the number of cells dying. This would not be a period of intense cell wall synthesis. The decline (choice F) and death (choice G) phases of the bacterial growth curve are periods when bacteria are dying more rapidly than they are dividing. Cell wall synthesis would be minimal."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right upper quadrant pain and a fever. He also has had a 2-month history of chronic diarrhea and bloody stools. Physical examination shows a large, tender liver. Ultrasound shows an ovoid, hypoechoic lesion near the liver capsule. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the liver will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Image A (Toxoplasma gondii)",
      "B. Image B (Fasciola hepatica)",
      "C. Image C (Clonorchis sinensis ovum)",
      "D. Image D (Entamoeba histolytica trophozoite)",
      "E. Image E (Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts)"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal amebic parasite that either can cause relatively mild diarrhea or can behave more aggressively, causing dysentery (bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain and dehydration), peritonitis, or liver abscess formation (such as this patient has). Treatment is generally administered as soon as the diagnosis is made. Metronidazole is the drug of choice for the treatment of this infection due to its excellent tissue penetration. Metronidazole is effective for both invasive and luminal disease. However, upon successful completion of metronidazole therapy, a 'luminal agent' such as paromomycin or iodoquinol is administered to completely eradicate any remaining gastrointestinal tract infection and prevent an infection relapse. The trophozoite of E. histolytica, which is shown in the image, is identified by the distinctive 'cart-wheel' distribution of chromatin in the nucleus and the evidence of ingested red blood cells. Toxoplasma gondii (choice A) is a cause of encephalitis in the immunocompromised, and birth defects in children infected transplacentally, but is not a common cause of liver abscess or bloody diarrhea. The large tissue cyst shown here would be characteristic of an early active stage of disease or reactivation disease in the immunocompromised. Fasciola hepatica (choice B) is the sheep liver fluke. It can cause bile duct obstruction in infected humans but would not be a likely cause of bloody diarrhea or of liver abscess. It is very rare in the United States. The adult fluke, shown here, is identified by the prominent 'shoulders' on the anterior end. Clonorchis sinensis (choice C) is the Chinese liver fluke. It causes hepatitis and cholangitis in Chinese populations, but not bloody diarrhea or liver abscess. The ovum, which is shown here, is identified by the prominent opercular ridge on the far right of this image. Cryptosporidium parvum (choice E) is a protozoan parasite related to T. gondii. In humans it can cause chronic bloody diarrhea in the immunocompromised, but it is not a cause of liver abscess. The image shows a Giemsa stain of the oocysts that would be found in the stool. Diagnosis of this condition is normally made by acid-fast staining of the stool."

    "question": "A 71-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes comes to the physician because of left-sided hearing loss. She states that she also has pain and discharge from the left ear. Physical examination shows a tender pinna, swelling and erythema of the external auditory canal, as well as a purulent discharge. The tympanic membrane cannot be visualized A CT scan of the head shows temporal bone erosions and new bone formation. Culture of the discharge will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative bacillus requiring factors X and V",
      "B. Gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting bacillus",
      "C. Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus that produces blue-green pigments",
      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic coccus",
      "E. Gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has malignant external otitis, which is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of self-limited external otitis. It may, however, penetrate the epithelium and invade the underlying soft tissue, cartilage and bone, thus leading to osteomyelitis and cranial nerve palsies. The presenting symptoms include ear pain and discharge, hearing loss, and facial nerve paralysis. Abnormalities of the external ear canal are present. A CT scan may reveal bony erosions and soft-tissue swelling. Cultures will isolate the organism. Treatment includes antibiotics and surgical debridement. Malignant external otitis is most common in elderly diabetic patients. Pseudomonas is a genus of gram-negative bacilli that are oxidase-positive, aerobic, and produce blue-green pigments. Other diseases caused by Pseudomonas include septicemia, wound or burn infections, urinary tract infections in catheterized patients, and life-threatening pneumonias in cystic fibrosis patients. A gram-negative bacillus requiring factors X and V (choice A) describes the genus Haemophilus. This genus may cause otitis media; symptoms of otitis media include ear pain, fever and a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane. A gram-negative oxidase-negative, non-lactose fermenting bacillus (choice B) describes some members (Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, and Salmonella) of the family Enterobacteriaceae. There are no agents of ear infections present in this group. Most of the Enterobacteriaceae are diarrhea-causing agents, or are causes of enteric fevers, neonatal meningitis, or urinary tract infections. A gram-positive, catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic coccus (choice D) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of otitis media but not of otitis externa, as in this case. A gram-positive catalase-negative beta-hemolytic coccus (choice E) describes Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae. S. pyogenes is a common cause of otitis media and S. agalactiae is the most common cause of neonatal septicemia and meningitis in the United States."

    "question": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a near-fatal fire. Over the next several days he develops pneumonia and progressive shortness of breath and is intubated. Gram stain of the sputum shows a gram-negative, encapsulated, oxidase-positive aerobic rod. Which of the following mechanisms allows the most likely causal organism to be resistant to many different antibiotics?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mutation of a penicillin-binding protein",
      "B. Mutation of a porin protein",
      "C. Mutation of a topoisomerase",
      "D. Plasmid-mediated acetyltransferase production",
      "E. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very common opportunist in burn patients, in whom it classically causes secondary wound infections and septicemia. It may also cause cystitis in patients with urinary catheters, and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. The organism is found in water and usually gains access to the body as a contaminant in the water used in respirators or in the water baths used to cleanse wounds. Pseudomonas is resistant to many antibiotics, and mutates to even more resistant strains during therapy. The most important means of resistance is through the mutation of a porin protein that restricts the flow of many antibiotics into the cell. Mutation of a penicillin-binding protein (choice A) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance exhibited by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mutation of a topoisomerase (choice C) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin that is exhibited by Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli. It is not, however considered the major mechanism of drug resistance to a wide variety of drugs. Plasmid-mediated acetyltransferase production (choice D) is a mechanism of drug resistance exhibited by Klebsiella and Enterobacter against gentamicin and by Salmonella against chloramphenicol. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production (choice E) is expressed in Pseudomonas and contributes to resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. It does not confer resistance to as many drugs as the alteration of the porin proteins, but is still a significant cause of resistance."

    "question": "A 2-week-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a one-day history of labored breathing. His home birth was uneventful and his immunizations are up-to-date but his mother reports that he developed conjunctivitis on the fourth day of life. He is afebrile and has a respiratory rate of 40/minute. Physical examination shows bilateral inspiratory crackles and a slight wheeze on auscultation of the chest. A chest x-ray is consistent with bilateral pneumonia. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 15,000/mm³ with 40% eosinophils. Which of the following is the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Chlamydia trachomatis",
      "C. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "D. Mycoplasma pneumoniae",
      "E. Neisseria gonorrhoeae",
      "F. Pneumocystis jiroveci",
      "G. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "H. Varicella zoster virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient presents with symptoms consistent with neonatal atypical pneumonia secondary to Chlamydia trachomatis. This agent is transmitted from the mother's vaginal secretions to the neonate at birth. The conjunctivitis precedes the pneumonitis. Tachypnea, hypoxemia, crackles, wheezing and eosinophilia are evident. Patients with mild to moderate illness with Chlamydia pneumonia may present with the 'staccato cough' (inspiration between each single cough). Chest x-ray may show scattered infiltrates and hyperinflation of the lungs. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) produces ascariasis and can cause pneumonia and eosinophilia. This is caused by ingestion of Ascaris eggs from human fecal contamination. Haemophilus influenzae (choice C) is an agent of pharyngitis, pneumonia, meningitis and epiglottitis in unvaccinated children between the ages of 3 months and 2 years. It would not be common in a neonate and would not associate with eosinophilia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (choice D) is the most common etiologic agent of atypical pneumonia in young people, but not in neonates. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (choice E) can cause ophthalmia neonatorum in this age-group of patient but would not be associated with pneumonia or eosinophilia. Pneumocystis jiroveci (choice F) causes pneumonia in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other immunocompromised patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice G) is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in adults, but would not be a common agent of pneumonia with eosinophilia following conjunctivitis in a neonate. Varicella (choice H) pneumonia is accompanied by pruritic skin lesions. Eosinophilia is not seen."

Examination of lower respiratory tract secretions obtained on transmural needle biopsy shows roughly spherical bodies with sharply outlined walls when stained with methenamine silver. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bordetella pertussis",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii)",
      "D. Respiratory syncytial virus",
      "E. Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The organism described is Pneumocystis jiroveci which is an opportunistic infection in premature infants and in patients with AIDS. It causes an atypical pneumonia due to the over-replication of type 2 pneumocytes and their production of surfactant-rich exudates, which fill the alveolar sacs and eventually cause death by asphyxiation. Bordetella pertussis (choice A) is the causative agent of whooping cough. The incidence of whooping cough has declined with the development of the vaccine. Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) is the causative agent of otitis media, epiglottitis, and meningitis in unvaccinated children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (choice D) would be a likely cause of respiratory distress in a premature infant, but the vignette describes the finding of spherical cysts with sharply outlined walls. RSV findings might indicate giant multinucleated cells or syncytia in the sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice E) is the most common cause of otitis media and pneumonia, but not in premature infants."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the physician because of painful, tingling lesions on her tongue. Physical examination shows vesicular lesions with associated erythema on the tongue. She says that she is preparing for her wedding in a few days. Which of the following best describes the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. A double-stranded DNA virus that has a complex lipid envelope",
      "B. A double-stranded DNA virus that is enveloped and icosahedral",
      "C. A gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic coccus",
      "D. A gram-positive, catalase-positive, beta-hemolytic coccus",
      "E. A positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is nonsegmented and naked"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The painful vesicular lesions on the tongue are characteristic of herpes simplex virus, and the most common strain that causes these lesions above the waist is herpes simplex type 1. Herpes simplex belongs to the Herpesviridae, which are double-stranded DNA viruses that are enveloped with nuclear membrane and are icosahedral. Stress is frequently an activating stimulus that causes herpes gingivostomatitis to break out from its location of latent infection in the ganglia. A double-stranded DNA virus that has a complex lipid envelope (choice A) describes the Poxviridae, a family that contains smallpox virus and molluscum contagiosum virus. Of these, smallpox virus is extinct and molluscum contagiosum is a common cause of benign, wartlike lesions in young adults. Molluscum does not cause vesicular lesions but rather umbilicated warts, and would not be common on the tongue. A gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic coccus (choice C) describes either Streptococcus pyogenes or Strep. agalactiae. Of these, Strep. pyogenes does cause skin lesions (impetigo) in young children, but these are honey-crusted, not vesicular, and would not be common on the tongue in an adult. A gram-positive catalase-positive beta-hemolytic coccus (choice D) describes Staphylococcus aureus, which is another agent of impetigo in children. Staph. aureus causes bullous impetigo, characterized by vesicular lesions, but would not be common on the tongue. A positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is nonsegmented and naked (choice E) describes the family Picornaviridae which includes the agents of herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease. These coxsackieviruses cause blister-like lesions in the mouth but would not be common on the tongue. Hand, foot, and mouth disease presents with vesicular lesions in the front of the buccal mucosa, and herpangina manifests with lesions in the rear of the mouth on the palate and fauces."

      "C. Orthomyxovirus",
      "D. Paramyxovirus",
      "E. Reovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This patient has mumps, which is caused by a negative-sense RNA virus in the Paramyxovirus family. This virus has been quite rare in the United States since the advent of the live-attenuated MMR vaccine. The mention of recent immigration suggests that the child may not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Bilateral parotitis and inflammation of the pancreas or testes are hallmarks of the infection in this age group. Other members of the Paramyxoviridae are parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles. The coronavirus family (choice A) includes corona virus and the SARS agent. The herpesvirus family (choice B) includes herpes simplex 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella zoster virus. The orthomyxovirus family (choice C) includes influenza virus. The reovirus family (choice E) includes rotavirus, reovirus, and Colorado tick fever virus."

    "options": [
      "A. Arthroconidia",
      "B. Monomorphic, encapsulated yeast",
      "C. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90 degrees",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has zygomycosis, caused by fungi of the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, or Mucor. Ketoacidotic diabetics are at risk for developing rhinocerebral infections following inhalation of the sporangiospores of these normally harmless bread molds. The fungi are identified by the nonseptate (ribbon-like) hyphae that branch at 90-degree angles. Arthroconidia and spherules (choices A and E) are the environmental form and diagnostic forms (respectively) of Coccidioides immitis, the causative agent of San Joaquin Valley fever. Monomorphic, encapsulated yeast (choice B) describes Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes meningitis in the immunocompromised. Septate hyphae branching at 45 degrees (choice D) describes Aspergillus, an opportunistic fungus that can cause sinus infections and spread to cause meningitis in the immunocompromised."

    "question": "A 38-year-old man with a history of hemophilia has had multiple infusions of clotting factors in his lifetime. Laboratory studies of ten batches of clotting factors administered to this patient show contamination with the human immunodeficiency virus, yet he has remained HIV-negative. The patient's CD4 count is 900/uL and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the virus is negative. Absence of which of the following cell surface receptors best explains the findings in this patient?",
    "options": ["A. CCR5", "B. CD4", "C. CD8", "D. Gp120", "E. TNF receptor"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection does not always progress to avert acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a few fortunate individuals (called nonprogressors) the infection remains asymptomatic, with a stable CD4 cell count and low or undetectable viremia. It is not entirely clear whether these patients will eventually develop AIDS. Some are resistant to HIV infection because they carry two defective copies of the gene encoding the CCR5 co-receptor. There are 15 known co-receptors, of which CCR5 and CXCR4 are the best characterized. CCR5 is a receptor for chemokines and serves as a co-receptor for HIV internalization into macrophages. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that serves as the co-receptor for HIV internalization into T lymphocytes. Approximately 1% of Caucasians in the United States are homozygous for such a protective CCR5 variant, and 20% are heterozygotes. HIV infection follows a slower course in heterozygotes. Homozygotes for this protective CCR5 variant are not present among Black and Asian populations. CD4 (choice B) is an important receptor of T-helper lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. It acts as the primary receptor for HIV binding. Binding to CD4, however, is not sufficient for the entry of HIV into the cells. Individuals without CD4 positive cells are defined as having a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and such a condition was not mentioned in the stem. The viral envelope gp120 protein (choice D) first binds CD4. This results in a conformational change in gp120 that allows this protein to bind co-receptors. Such co-receptors are present on lymphocytes and macrophages and normally serve as binding sites for chemokines. Once gp120 binds to CD4 and a co-receptor, a second viral protein gp41 facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, allowing 'injection' of the viral core into the cell. Neither CD8 (choice C) nor the receptor for TNF (choice E) plays a role in HIV binding to cells. CD8 is the co-receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes that stabilizes the interaction between the T cell receptor and the major histocompatibility molecule. The TNF receptor is a molecule on T lymphocytes that receives stimulatory signals from macrophages or in other cases receives apoptotic signals in various cells."

Which of the following diseases did this patient most likely have at 1 year of age?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mumps",
      "B. Parvovirus B19",
      "C. Polio",
      "D. Rubella",
      "E. Rubeola"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This child had subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is a very rare, late complication of measles (rubeola) infection at an early age. The existence of this complication is part of the rationale for immunizing children against measles at an early age. It is thought that the immune and neurologic systems of very young children may permit the virus to become established in the brain. The exact mechanism of injury is poorly understood, but the brain shows encephalitis involving both gray and white matter. Forty percent of cases die within 1 year, and it is thought that the disease is probably always eventually fatal. Mumps (choice A) causes parotitis and fever in young children, and causes the complications of pancreatitis and orchitis when older individuals acquire the infection. Mumps is not known to cause CNS pathology. Parvovirus B19 (choice B) causes erythema infectiosum, or slapped-cheek fever in school-age children, and hydrops fetalis in fetuses infected in utero. It is also associated with aplastic crises in sickle-cell anemia patients, but is not known to cause CNS pathology. Polio (choice C) spreads from the blood to the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and motor cortex of the brain. It causes an asymmetric flaccid paralysis without sensory loss. Spasticity is not a common finding in polio. Rubella (choice D) or German measles, causes a mild 3-day rash in adults but is known to be teratogenic in the fetus if a mother is infected during gestation. The syndrome in the neonate (congenital rubella syndrome) includes patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, cataracts, microcephaly, and deafness."

      "D. 600-799 cells/mm³",
      "E. Above 800 cells/mm³"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has progressed from being asymptomatic to the point that he has a condition attributed to HIV infection, but not an AIDS-defining condition. The most likely CD4 count associated with this stage of disease would be between 200 and 399 cells/mm³. A CD4 cell count of 0-199 (choice A) would be the expected count in a patient who has progressed to full-blown AIDS. Full-blown AIDS is defined by the presence of a variety of infections or conditions that demonstrate a life-threatening collapse of the immune system. Examples of such conditions would include HIV encephalopathy, Pneumocystis pneumonia, Kaposi sarcoma, cryptosporidiosis, or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. A CD4 cell count of 400-599 (choice C) is a range that would be associated with a finding of generalized lymphadenopathy or asymptomatic infection. The existence of thrush in the present patient indicates that he has progressed to the early symptomatic phase of the disease. A CD4 cell count in the range of 600-799 (choice D) would be expected in an asymptomatic patient without generalized lymphadenopathy or thrush. A CD4 cell count above 800 (choice E) is considered a normal value in an uninfected individual."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man who recently emigrated from Brazil comes to the physician for a pre-employment physical examination. A chest x-ray shows a patchy, bilateral pneumonia and a lung mass. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the mass shows fungal organisms with a few multiply-budding yeast forms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Blastomycosis",
      "B. Coccidioidomycosis",
      "C. Histoplasmosis",
      "D. Paracoccidioidomycosis",
      "E. Sporotrichosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Latin America and multiply-budding ('pilot's wheel') yeasts are clues for paracoccidioidomycosis. This disease is caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Blastomycosis (choice A) results in large budding yeasts in the sputum. It is found in the great riverbeds of the eastern half of the United States, with North and South Carolina being especially highly endemic. It causes acute and chronic lung infections as well as disseminated disease and is a special problem in the immunocompromised person. Coccidioidomycosis (choice B) is a fungus of the U.S. desert southwest. It also causes acute and chronic pulmonary infections, disseminated infections, and cutaneous lesions, but the tissue form would be spherules with endospores. Histoplasmosis (choice C) is endemic along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio river valleys of the United States. It causes acute and chronic pulmonary infections and disseminated infections in the immunocompromised. The tissue form is an intracellular, unencapsulated yeast. Sporotrichosis (choice E) causes skin lesions in rose gardeners that may be single cutaneous mycetomas or may follow lymphatic drainages. The tissue form is a cigar-shaped yeast."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of pain on swallowing. Physical examination shows white, plague-like material that is easily scraped off from the tongue and on the buccal mucosa. Which of the following laboratory tests is most appropriate to confirm the identity of the causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. CAMP test",
      "B. ELEK test",
      "C. Germ-tube test",
      "D. Heterophile antibody test",
      "E. Weil-Felix test"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Candida albicans produces oral thrush, which is common in acute HIV disease and becomes increasingly common as the CD4+ cell count falls. Candida plaques can generally be scraped off easily while those in a similar condition in HIV-infected individuals, hairy leukoplakia, cannot. Diagnosis is by demonstration of pseudohyphae formation in animal serum, the basis of the germ-tube test. The CAMP test (choice A) is used to identify a partial hemolytic agent produced by Streptococcus agalactiae. It is used to distinguish between group A and group B streptococci, along with testing for bacitracin sensitivity. Group B streptococci cause neonatal meningitis and septicemia, not the oral lesions described here. The ELEK test (choice B) is used to identify toxin-producing strains of bacteria in the oropharynx that resemble Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is used to differentiate between the pathogen C. diphtheriae and normal flora diphtheroids. C. diphtheriae causes gray fibrinous exudates to form on the uvula and upper airways. It does not have an association with HIV infection. Heterophile antibody tests (choice D) are common in medicine in cases in which a causal agent is difficult to identify or culture. These tests depend on the detection of accidental cross-reactions between antibodies formed during an infection with an unrelated substance. Key examples of heterophile antibody tests include the Monospot test for Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis, the Weil-Felix test for rickettsial infections, and the VDRL for syphilis. None of these tests would be used to identify the cause of a white oral exudate in an AIDS patient. The Weil-Felix test (choice E) is a heterophile antibody test used in the diagnosis of several rickettsial diseases. It depends on the accidental cross-reaction between antibodies produced during rickettsial infections and the OX strain of Proteus vulgaris. Rickettsial diseases are arthropod-borne diseases that are all characterized by rashes. None of them would be consistent with the signs in this case."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vaginal itching and a yellow, malodorous discharge that is worse following her menses. She is sexually active with two partners and recently had unprotected sex Pelvic examination shows erythema of the cervix. Microscopic examination of vaginal secretions will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Clue cells",
      "B. Gram-negative diplococci",
      "C. Motile trophozoites",
      "D. Obligate intracellular pathogens",
      "E. Yeast"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan parasite that causes a sexually transmitted disease. The vaginitis it causes is characterized by a frothy yellow discharge. It causes spotty reddening of the mucosa that is referred to as a 'strawberry' mucosa. The organism can be identified in saline mounts of vaginal fluids by its characteristic corkscrew motility. This is caused by the fact that the organism has flagella on one end, and an undulating membrane going down its side that causes it to rotate on its longitudinal axis while it moves in a single direction. Clue cells (choice A) are the diagnostic clue for bacterial vaginosis (BV), usually due to overgrowth of the normal vaginal flora by Gardnerella vaginalis. BV would also have a malodorous discharge, but it would be thin and gray, not frothy and yellow. It is worse following menses, but is not always sexually associated. Gram-negative diplococci (choice B) describes Neisseria gonorrhoeae which would cause a neutrophil-rich discharge and erosions of the vaginal mucosa. A Gram stain of the neutrophilic discharge would show gram-negative diplococci. Obligate intracellular pathogens (choice D) describes Chlamydia trachomatis, serotypes D-K, which would not cause such a discharge. Yeast (choice E) is most likely Candida albicans, a common cause of vaginitis. Candida causes a white, cottage cheese-like discharge."

    "question": "A newborn who is born at 37 weeks' gestation has purple splotches on the skin, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. A CT of the head shows calcifications. Which of the following is also associated with the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hairy oral leukoplakia",
      "B. Heterophile-negative mononucleosis",
      "C. Hodgkin lymphoma",
      "D. Kaposi sarcoma",
      "E. Lymphoproliferative disease"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The most common agents causing congenital infection in the United States are cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Congenital CMV infection, which occurs in 1 to 2% of all live births in the United States, results from transplacental acquisition of a primary or recurrent maternal infection. Most infections are asymptomatic, but about 5% will present with hepatosplenomegaly, periventricular brain calcification, petechial hemorrhages, and hydrops. Sensorineural deafness is a common manifestation in affected infants. Primary infection of the mother is strongly associated with more severe symptoms in affected infants. The mortality rate is 30%, and most of the survivors will have neurologic impairment. CMV infections in children and adults are often asymptomatic; however the virus is responsible for 10% of infectious mononucleosis cases (characterized by an absence of sheep red blood cell agglutinins: heterophile-negative mononucleosis). CMV also causes serious disease in immunosuppressed patients, including bone-marrow recipients and AIDS patients. Ganciclovir is the drug of choice although foscarnet has also been used with some success. Hairy oral leukoplakia (choice A) is a condition caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in AIDS patients and is associated with hyperproliferation of the lingual epithelia. EBV although it belongs to the same family as CMV, is not associated with in utero infections. Hodgkin lymphoma (choice C) is associated with EBV. Kaposi sarcoma (choice D) is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpesvirus-8 coinfections. It is a sarcoma of endothelial cells. Although HIV can be acquired in utero, it would not be associated with thrombocytopenic purpura. Lymphoproliferative disease (choice E) is associated with EBV infections in AIDS patients."

    "question": "A 37-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of incoordination and unsteadiness. Physical examination shows impaired proprioception and locomotor ataxia. A complete blood count is within normal limits. A diagnosis of degeneration of dorsal columns and dorsal roots of the spinal cord is made. Which of the following is most likely present in this patient's history?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ingestion of poorly cooked fish",
      "B. Leukorrheic vaginal discharge",
      "C. Maculopapular, dark-colored rash",
      "D. Painful genital lesion",
      "E. Travel to Africa"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The findings described are those of tabes dorsalis, a form of tertiary syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum. Tabes dorsalis and other forms of tertiary syphilis are now uncommon in the United States; possibly because the common use of antibiotics may 'treat' many unsuspected cases of syphilis. The hallmark lesion of tertiary syphilis is the gumma, a syphilitic granuloma that forms in the central nervous system and in the vasculature. Tertiary syphilis is preceded by secondary syphilis, in which there is a maculopapular, bronzing rash and condylomata lata (flat, wartlike growths in the perianal or perigenital area). Primary syphilis is characterized by the finding of a painless, ulcerated genital lesion. Neurosyphilis can take many forms, including acute syphilitic meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, general paresis and/or optic atrophy. Tabes dorsalis is a slowly progressive degenerative neurologic disease that affects the dorsal columns with demyelination and the dorsal roots with inflammatory changes accompanied by fibrosis. There is loss of pain sensation and peripheral reflexes, accompanied by impairment of vibration and position senses, with progressive ataxia. Ingestion of poorly cooked fish (choice A) is the means of infection with Diphyllobothrium latum, which is a tapeworm that competes with the host for vitamin B12. As a result, the infection may mimic pernicious anemia, and it may also cause degeneration of the dorsal columns and roots of the spinal cord (subacute combined degeneration) that may closely mimic syphilis. However, the two conditions can be distinguished by the presence of a megaloblastic anemia in vitamin B12 deficiency. Leukorrheic vaginal discharge (choice B) would be observed in a woman with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, but is not found in any stage of syphilis. Painful genital ulcers (choice D) are caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, but the chancres of syphilis are painless and indurated. Travel to Africa (choice E) would likely be important in the history of a patient with granuloma inguinale (caused by Klebsiella granulomatis) or lymphogranuloma venereum (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1, L2 and L3) but would not be a prerequisite for a diagnosis of syphilis."

No signet ring cells are seen. Which of the following risk factors has the highest association with this presentation?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alcohol consumption",
      "B. infection with Helicobacter pylori",
      "C. Nitrate content of the diet",
      "D. Pernicious anemia",
      "E. Tobacco use"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has gastric carcinoma, which has been strongly linked to prior gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori with subsequent development of intestinal metaplasia and gastric mucosal atrophy. H. pylori has also been implicated in the etiologies of gastric/peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis, and gastric lymphoma. The disease-causing strains of H. pylori contain a pathogenicity island containing the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and a type IV secretory system that injects the CagA protein into host cells. The relative risk factor associating H. pylori infection with gastric carcinoma is approximately 6.0. Alcohol consumption (choice A) has been shown in several studies to increase the risk of gastric carcinoma two-fold. High nitrate content of the diet (choice C) has been shown to increase the risk of gastric carcinoma by 1.2-fold. Pernicious anemia (choice D) has been associated with a three-fold increase in incidence of gastric carcinoma. Tobacco use (choice E) has been shown to increase the risk of gastric carcinoma almost five-fold."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vaginal discharge, bleeding, and dyspareunia Examination of tissue obtained on cervical scraping shows cytoplasmic inclusions within epithelial cells The most likely causal organism is unable to synthesize which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenosine triphosphate",
      "B. Cell wall",
      "C. Cholesterol",
      "D. Cysteine",
      "E. Protoporphyrin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The disease is chlamydial cervicitis. This sexually transmitted infection is usually suspected after treatment for gonorrhea fails to relieve symptoms. However, a few cases are picked up when cytoplasmic inclusions composed of aggregates of Chlamydia are identified on Pap smears. Confirmation can be made with fluorescent antibodies that pick up both the aggregates and individual bacteria known as 'elementary bodies'. The organisms are obligate intracellular parasites because they have lost the ability to synthesize ATP. They also produce a cell wall that does not contain muramic acid, one of the two normal components of bacterial peptidoglycan. Cell wall (choice B) synthesis is absent in Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma but all other prokaryotes possess a cell wall. Chlamydia have an unusual cell wall made only of N-acetyl-glutamic acid, but it is still a cell wall. Failure to synthesize cholesterol (choice C) is not usually a problem for prokaryotes since they do not have sterols in their cell membranes. Mycoplasmas however, require cholesterol in their diet so that they can include sterols in their unique membranes. Cysteine (choice D) is required by four genera of bacteria (Legionella, Pasteurella, Brucella, and Francisella), but not by Chlamydia. Protoporphyrin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (choice E) are required by Haemophilus organisms, but not Chlamydia."

    "options": [
      "A. Hepatitis B",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The Warthin-Finkeldey (WF) giant cell described here is pathognomonic for measles or the live attenuated measles vaccine. Most giant cells are composed of histiocytes, but the WF giant cell is created by fusion of lymphocytes. Although postvaccinal lymphadenitis may be seen with different vaccines, the usual reaction is immunoblastic proliferation within the paracortical regions of a hyperplastic lymph node. Hepatitis B (choice A), human papillomavirus (choice B), tetanus (choice D), and varicella zoster (choice E) are rarely associated with postvaccinal lymphadenitis."

      "A. antigenically variable pili",
      "B. Both hyphae and spores",
      "C. Cannot make ATP",
      "D. No true cell wall",
      "E. Visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Having both hyphae and spores (choice B) would be true of Candida, which usually causes arthritis as a rare complication of systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma do not have true cell walls (choice D) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete that is visible only with darkfield microscopy (choice E) or direct fluorescent antibody. Secondary syphilis can (uncommonly) cause an acute arthritis, but syphilis is rare in an otherwise healthy adult."

    "question": "A 10-year-old boy develops an abscess on his left knee. Examination of the exudate shows neutrophils containing mixed bacterial flora. Which of the following is the most important virulence factor for bacterial survival within the phagolysosome?",
    "options": [
      "A. catalase",
      "B. Hemolysin",
      "C. Hyaluronidase",
      "D. streptokinase",
      "E. Tetanospasmin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome. Tetanospasmin (choice E) is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It inhibits the inhibitory mediators glycine and GABA, and promotes the rigid paralysis of tetanus. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome."

    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of sore throat and a fever. Physical examination shows pharyngeal erythema with a tonsillar abscess. Culture of oropharyngeal secretions on sheep's blood agar grows colonies of gram-positive cocci that are surrounded by a zone of complete hemolysis. Another culture of the secretions on mannitol salt agar grows well and causes the medium to turn yellow. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "E. Streptococcus salivarius"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx; constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx and a tonsillar exudate. Streptococcus salivarius (choice E) is a gram-positive coccus that is usually alpha-hemolytic. It is normal flora of the oral cavity and is sometimes implicated in subacute bacterial endocarditis, but is not associated with tonsillar abscesses."

      "D. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "E. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "F. Streptococcus sanguis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Streptococcus bovis is a group D Streptococcus. There is a significant association between S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon and other colonic diseases. Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are reported to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. The group D Streptococci are distinguished by having a cell wall carbohydrate composed of glycerol teichoic acid. S. agalactiae (choice A) is a group B Streptococcus that is the number-one cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia in the United States. S. mutans and S. sanguis (choices C and F) are viridans streptococci, which are normal flora of the oral mucosa. While they are associated with bacterial endocarditis, it is usually associated with invasive dental work and a preexisting heart valve defect. S. pneumoniae (choice D) which is a non-groupable Streptococcus (it does not have a C cell wall carbohydrate), is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in the United States. S. pyogenes (choice E) is a group A Streptococcus and is associated with pharyngitis, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of a several month history of chronic fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats.

      "E. Virus, p24, RNA Undetectable | CD4+ Normal | Anti-p24 Decreasing | Anti-env Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 525/mm³, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient, measured by RT-PCR for viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Antibodies against the envelope glycoproteins are generally IgM, which does not require a primary immune response. The IgM anti-env antibody can be made in the absence of TH cells. Increasing p24 virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood. This does not happen in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This young woman is infected with Chlamydia trachomatis the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells. It has sterols in its membrane (choice A) is a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These are the only prokaryotes that totally lack a cell wall, but instead have sterols in their membranes. It lacks a cell wall (choice B) is also a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These prokaryotes are devoid of a cell wall but have sterols in their membranes. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol (choice C) is a statement that describes the fungi. The ergosterol molecule is unique to fungi and is the target molecule for nystatin and the imidazoles.

      "C. It inhibits the synthesis of beta-glucan",
      "D. It interferes with mitotic spindle function",
      "E. It interferes with thymidylate synthetase and DNA synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test, the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the “conazole” antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A). This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patients oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum. Flucytosine interferes with thymidylate synthetase (choice E). This agent is used in the treatment of cryptococcosis. It is contraindicated in HIV patients, as it may cause bone marrow suppression in those patients."

    "question": "A medical virology laboratory coinfects cells in a tissue culture flask with influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1). The flask is incubated for 48 hours and the progeny viruses are analyzed. Four distinct variants of influenza A are isolated: H3N2, H1N1, H3N1, and H1N2 Which of the following viral attributes most likely made the production of H3N1 and H1N2 variants possible?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. High mutational rate",
      "C. Phenotypic mixing",
      "D. segmented genome",
      "E. Syncytia formation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

    "options": [
      "A. Ecthyma gangrenosum",
      "B. Erythema migrans",
      "C. Food poisoning",
      "D. Nonmycotic mycetoma",
      "E. Pharyngitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes malignant otitis externa which is a severe necrotizing infection of the external ear canal. Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone, temporal bone, sigmoid sinus, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Patients at increased risk include the elderly, people with diabetes, and the immunocompromised. Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes (since the organism can be cultured from the shoes), burn infections, and pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients. Ecthyma gangrenosum is the name of the characteristic lesion that occurs during Pseudomonas septicemias. It has a black, necrotic center and a raised hemorrhagic ring outside. Erythema migrans (choice B) is the target-shaped rash that occurs in the early stages of Lyme disease. Food poisoning (choice C) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas. Nonmycotic mycetoma (choice D) is caused by Actinomyces and Nocardia. Pharyngitis (choice E) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas."

      "D. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus",
      "E. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, naked, icosahedral virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Outbreaks occur seasonally in winter and early spring. Infection does not result in lasting immunity, and reinfection can occur. The virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, a group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are nonsegmented, helical, and enveloped. Double-stranded DNA, naked, icosahedral virus (choice A) describes the Adenoviruses, which are capable of causing conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. However, these agents are not common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Negative-sense single-stranded RNA with eight segments, helical, enveloped virus (choice C) describes the Orthomyxoviruses, which include influenza virus. Influenza is a systemic illness characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache myalgias, malaise, and prostration, followed by cough, nasal obstruction, and sore throat. The lower respiratory tract may also be involved. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus (choice D) describes the Coronaviruses, which cause the common cold (nasal obstruction and discharge, sneezing, mild or no fever, occasional sore throat, and/or cough) and acute pharyngitis (sore throat with or without cervical adenopathy, ulceration, and conjunctivitis). SARS-CoV also belongs to this family and causes a seasonal acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is usually imported into this hemisphere from the Far East. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA naked, icosahedral virus (choice E) describes the Picornaviruses and Caliciviruses. Within the Picornaviridae, rhinoviruses cause the common cold but would not be common agents of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants."

      "A. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes",
      "B. Introns",
      "C. Points of bacteriophage insertion",
      "D. Points of site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. A resistance transfer factor is a bacterial plasmid that encodes one or more drug-resistance genes and has the capability of mediating its own transfer to another bacterium during conjugation (it possesses the F operon). Most of the known resistance transfer factors have been formed by the accumulation of transposons into fertility factor plasmids. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are capable of movement within bacterial cells. When they carry drug-resistance genes and accumulate in plasmids that already possess the F operon, multiple drug-resistant plasmids (resistance transfer factors) are formed. The flanking sequences in the DNA of a transposon are indirect repeats that are complementary and antiparallel to one another. When transposons insert themselves into a new location, they do so by site-specific recombination, creating direct repeats (identical nucleotide sequences created during the repair of a staggered cut created by the transposon restriction endonuclease). Therefore, in the diagram shown, the rectangular blocks could represent either the direct repeats caused by transposition or the indirect repeats that are the outside edges of the mobile segments of DNA. In either event, they are representations of points at which transposons have inserted their mobile DNA via site-specific recombination. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes (choice A) is not correct. Although each transposon (and there are three that have moved to create the resistance transfer factor shown) carries its own restriction endonuclease and the gene that encodes it, the diagram clearly shows the presence of two rectangles for each of the transposons, and a given transposon would carry only one copy, not two copies, of its endonuclease gene. Introns (choice B) are repetitive, non-transcribed segments of DNA that do not occur in prokaryotes. Points of bacteriophage insertion (choice C) or insertion sequences are palindromic sequences of nucleotides in a bacterial genome that are identical to those found in the genomes of temperate phages. When these sequences are cleaved by a restriction endonuclease the phage genome can be inserted by site-specific recombination into the bacterial chromosome and the state of lysogeny is begun. Bacteriophages are not involved in the formation of resistance transfer factors. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are responsible for the formation of multiple drug-resistant plasmids such as the one shown here, but they are not represented by the rectangular blocks. In the diagram, the transposons are the sequences between the rectangular blocks, so there are three transposons that accumulated here to create this resistance transfer factor."

    "question": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain over the past 24 hours. She recently returned from a 4-month trip to Central America. She says that she had bloody diarrhea for the last 4 weeks of her trip. A CT scan of the abdomen shows lesions that appear to be multiple abscesses. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "C. Enterobius vermicularis",
      "D. Salmonella typhi",
      "E. Shigella species"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient probably has hepatic amebiasis, which is a life-threatening complication of intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. E. histolytica is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Intestinal colonization (which may be asymptomatic) always precedes infection of the liver. The abscesses generally contain necrotic debris, with amoebas located along the edges of the abscess. Treatment for liver abscesses of this origin is metronidazole, while iodoquinol is useful to destroy the luminal stages of the parasite. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) can cause intestinal obstruction, and may cause abscesses if it invades the common bile duct. It would not cause bloody diarrhea. Enterobius vermicularis (choice C) is the pinworm, which inhabits the rectum. Bloody diarrhea can also be seen with some strains of Salmonella (choice D) and Shigella (choice E), but these organisms do not usually cause hepatic abscesses. Bacterial causes of hepatic abscesses include E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas."

      "E. Septate hyphae at 45-degree angles",
      "F. spherules"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This is a classic case of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis. Clues include the patient population (HIV-positive), and the CSF findings suggesting a fungal etiology. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal meningitis of the immunocompromised in the United States. It is a monomorphic fungus, unlike many of the classic pathogens within the fungal group, so the encapsulated yeast form would be found both in clinical specimens and in the environment as the infectious form. Broad-based, budding yeasts (choice A) would be the forms expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Blastomyces dermatitidis - which is far more likely to present with skin and bone lesions than with meningitis. Budding yeasts in a 'pilot's wheel' arrangement (choice B) would be the form expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis which is limited in geographic region to Central and South America and typically presents as a primary pulmonary disease. Intracellular yeasts within macrophages (choice D) are the diagnostic form of Histoplasma capsulatum which, despite its name, is not an encapsulated yeast. It is primarily a pulmonary infection acquired by exposure to the droppings of birds or bats. Septate hyphae with 45-degree angles (choice E) are the transmission forms of Aspergillus which is a major opportunistic infection. Aspergillus may cause meningitis in this patient population, but it is not nearly as common as Cryptococcus. Spherules (choice F) would be the yeast forms characteristic of Coccidioides immitis which may be a cause of fungal meningitis in immunologically compromised individuals but is geographically restricted to the Sonoran desert zone of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever)."

The physician should monitor this pregnancy closely for the development of which of the fetal conditions?",
    "options": [
      "A. Congenital heart disease",
      "B. Cutaneous scarring",
      "C. Hemolytic anemia",
      "D. Hydrocephalus",
      "E. Non-immune hydrops"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. There are two parts to this question. The first is realizing that the student's illness is the classic description of Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum. It is caused by parvovirus B19, which is spread from human to human. Animals do not carry this particular parvovirus. The disease is contagious prior to the onset of the rash. The initial symptoms, during the period of contagion, are nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, myalgia, lethargy, coryza, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain. When the typical 'slapped-cheek' rash begins, the student is no longer contagious. The rash begins with the erythematous cheeks, then the upper part of the body becomes red and then reticulated, i.e., the typical lacy appearance of the rash develops. This fades but can come and go for the next 3 weeks. Parvovirus is a cause of aplastic anemia. It may be responsible for aplastic crises in patients with sickle-cell anemia. In addition, exposure of a pregnant woman in the first trimester may result in a fetus with aplastic anemia, which results in non-immune hydrops fetalis. Because the virus infects immature erythrocytes, causing severe anemia, the fetus dies of cardiac failure. Congenital heart defects (choice A) may occur due to many different reasons. They are, however associated with the congenital rubella syndrome, in which a patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis are most commonly seen. Cutaneous scarring (choice B) occurs in an infant with congenital varicella syndrome (exposure to varicella during pregnancy). The other major feature is limb defects. Hemolytic anemias (choice C) are usually not associated with prenatal exposure to an infectious agent. They may be produced due to isoimmunization (Rh disease), red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis), or red cell enzyme defects (pyruvate kinase deficiency), as well as many other etiologies. Hydrocephalus (choice D) also has diverse etiologies. There is an association with prenatal exposure to mumps and the fetal development of aqueductal stenosis resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus."

    "question": "An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a fever, sore throat, and rash. Physical examination shows an exudative pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy and tenderness, and a diffuse, sandpaper-like erythematous rash. Which of the following mechanisms is responsible for the expression of the toxin that produces these signs?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Homologous recombination",
      "C. Lysogenic conversion",
      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The question describes a girl with streptococcal pharyngitis with a characteristic rash. This combination is scarlet fever, and is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes via its erythrogenic exotoxin (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, SPE). SPE-A, SPE-B, and SPE-C. The production of this extra virulence is an example of lysogenic conversion. In this case, the DNA of a temperate phage is inserted into the bacterial chromosome and produces a prophage. Besides the repressor protein, the prophage DNA also directs the synthesis of other gene products that make the bacteria more pathogenic. Conjugation (choice A) is one of the three methods whereby DNA is transferred from one cell to another. In this case, it is done by cell-to-cell contact. It is not the means by which the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins are expressed. Homologous recombination (choice B) is a gene exchange process that stabilizes some genes that have been introduced by conjugation, transformation, or transduction. During the process there is an exchange of pieces of DNA between a linear piece of DNA and a region on the stable circular bacterial chromosome. In site-specific recombination (choice D) a DNA molecule is integrated into a molecule of DNA with which it has no homology, except for a small site on each DNA that is called an insertion site. The end result is the sum of the two original DNA molecules. Transformation (choice E) is another way in which genes are transferred. In this case, naked DNA is taken up by another cell. Cells that can take up naked DNA from the environment need to become competent, and do so under certain environmental conditions. The newly introduced DNA is generally linear, homologous DNA from the same type of cell, but one that may be genetically diverse. Once introduced into the new cell, some genes may become stabilized by homologous recombination."

    "question": "During an investigational study, new combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules are found on the progeny viruses of a prevalent serotype of the swine influenza virus and the prevalent serotype of the human influenza virus. The progeny viruses are genetically stable when purified and are used to infect new tissue cultures. Which of the following mechanisms most likely accounts for the production of the new viral progeny?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. Genetic drift",
      "C. Genetic shift",
      "D. Phenotypic masking",
      "E. Phenotypic mixing"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza and other viruses with segmented genomes (Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus) are capable of genetic reassortment. This is an accidental 'shuffling' of the segments of genomic RNA so that new genetic combinations can be produced. Viruses that have segmented genomes have multiple pieces of RNA that must be assembled correctly in the progeny to produce a new generation that is identical to the parental generation. When accidental rearrangements occur, genetic shift results; and in influenza, this is responsible for the production of pandemics of disease. Complementation (choice A) occurs when two viruses infect a single cell. If one is defective in a certain gene product, progeny viruses can be produced as long as that defect can be 'complemented' by the makeup of the other virus. If both viruses have the same defect, no progeny viruses can be produced. In the case given here, two viable viruses were grown in a single cell and new combinations of surface molecules were produced. Genetic drift (choice B) refers to random mutational changes that can occur in any reproducing organism. These changes can change the surface of the organism, which affects the host immune response to the organism. Changes such as these are more gradual than genetic shift, and are best described in viruses such as HIV. Phenotypic masking (choice D) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is created from the genome of one of the viruses while the genome included in the capsid is from the other virus. Thus, one genome is 'masked' or covered with the antigens of the other virus. In the case described here, combinations of surface molecules were expressed. Phenotypic mixing (choice E) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is a mixture of the capsid antigens from the two parental viruses. Since the genomic RNA is not actually reassorted in that case, it would not be a stable genetic change but simply a reflection of the antigens of both parental viruses being inserted on the surfaces of a single progeny generation."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen that is associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and that commonly causes cystitis. It is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod that reduces nitrates to nitrites. It is important to know that the pili and motility of the bacteria contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with cystitis can develop bacteremia and subsequent septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The present patient has an obstructive lesion of the urinary tract that predisposes him to the overgrowth of microorganisms such as E. coli. Pulmonary symptoms are consistent with ARDS. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) might be a Neisseria sp. or Moraxella catarrhalis. N. gonorrhoeae is the cause of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that presents asymptomatically or with urethritis. Patients are usually younger and sexually active. M. catarrhalis is usually implicated as a cause of otitis media and sinusitis in children. It is also implicated as a cause of purulent tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in a population of patients who are older than 50 years and who have underlying obstructive lung disease. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis rarely cause cystitis. S. saprophyticus causes UTIs but the patients are typically young, sexually active women. Enterococcus is a relatively common cause of UTIs in hospitalized patients with indwelling urinary catheters who are receiving broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Enterococcal bacteremia can lead to endocarditis, but would not commonly cause ARDS. Gram-positive diplococci (choice D) would be a description of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Gram-positive rods (choice E) would include members of the following genera: Clostridium, Bacillus, Listeria, and Corynebacterium. The only significant member of this group to produce UTIs is Corynebacterium urealyticum (C. jeikeium). This organism creates an alkaline urine environment with the potential for stone formation. Patients are usually immunocompromised or have had recurrent UTIs."

These infections are most common in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America and are associated with a very high mortality among pregnant women. Hepatitis E is caused by a naked capsid RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae (formerly Caliciviridae). Adenoviridae (choice A) is a group of naked capsid double-stranded DNA viruses that may cause upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis, but are not generally associated with hepatitis. Flaviviridae (choice B) is the family to which hepatitis C virus belongs.

      "E. Poliovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Most RNA viruses (e.g., poliovirus) replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore can replicate in enucleated cells. Poliovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae. These viruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA. The exception to the rule regarding RNA viruses is the family Orthomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses (choice C). Orthomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral mRNA transcription. Adenoviruses (choice A) are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome. All DNA viruses except the family Poxviridae carry out their replication in the nucleus, and therefore would not be capable of completing their life cycles in enucleated cells. Cytomegalovirus (choice B) is a member of family Herpesviridae. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome, and thus replicates in the nucleus. JC virus (choice D) belongs to family Polyomaviridae. It is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded circular DNA genome. It would not be able to complete its life cycle in an enucleated cell."

    "question": "A total of 2 x 10² Streptococcus viridans are inoculated into a flask containing 1 L of enriched broth. If the lag time is 30 minutes and the generation time is 20 minutes, how many bacteria will there be in the culture after 2.5 hours?",
    "options": [
      "A. 6 x 10²",
      "B. 12 x 10²",
      "C. 16 x 10²",
      "D. 32 x 10²",
      "E. 128 x 10²"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. During the lag time by definition, bacteria newly introduced into a culture will undergo metabolic changes necessary for use of the medium, but will not increase in number. Therefore, at the end of the first 30 minutes of elapsed time the number of bacteria in the culture will be 2 x 10². Thereafter, the number of bacteria will double every 20 minutes (the definition of 'generation time'). This means that after 2.5 hours (150 minutes) of total elapsed time, 120 minutes (150 min - 30 min lag) will be available for growth. Since generation time is 20 minutes, six generations will have occurred (120 min / 20 min/gen = 6 gen). So the original inoculum will double six times: 2 x 10² * 2⁶ = 2 x 10² * 64 = 128 x 10². Choice A (6 x 10²) is not the correct answer. The student who selects this answer forgot that lag periods occur only once per culture, and also incorrectly multiplied the starting inoculum number by an incorrect number of generations (three). Choice B (12 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of counting the number of possible generations and multiplying by that number. Remember that every generation time means that every bacterium in that culture has divided into two, so the student must multiply by 2 six times, or 2⁶. Choice C (16 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of forgetting that the lag time occurs only one time per culture. The student who selects this answer divided the 2.5 hours of culture time between three lag periods and three correctly calculated generations (2³). Choice D (32 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of including the lag period within the first generation time (overlapping the two, and forgetting that they are distinct and separate periods). The student who did this would therefore count five possible generations and, multiplying correctly thereafter by 2⁵, would arrive at this incorrect answer."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man with AIDS develops multifocal encephalitis. He reports having a unilateral, vesicular rash 1 month ago Treatment with acyclovir is begun, but he dies on the fourth day after admission. Which of the following viruses is most likely responsible for the development of encephalitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus",
      "B. Herpes simplex type-1",
      "C. Herpes simplex type-2",
      "D. Herpes zoster",
      "E. Measles virus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The specific clue to the cause of the severe encephalitis in this AIDS patient is the history of shingles, due to reactivation of the herpes zoster (varicella zoster) virus. In otherwise healthy adults, the virus (which is usually introduced to the body as a childhood case of chickenpox) remains dormant in a dorsal root ganglion only to reactivate in later life, causing a painful vesicular eruption that characteristically conforms to the distribution of a single dermatome. In AIDS patients, the virus can cause a severe multifocal encephalitis that may be resistant to acyclovir therapy. Cytomegalovirus (choice A) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but is less likely in the present patient, given his past history of shingles. Herpes simplex type-1 (choice B) and type-2 (choice C) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but are less likely in this patient, given his past history of shingles and the lack of response to acyclovir. Measles virus (choice E) appears to be related to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis but this condition is not specifically increased in AIDS patients."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes comes to the physician because of an unresolved skin lesion on his foot. The lesion appeared several weeks ago, but recently has expanded and become painful. Physical examination shows a 5-cm lesion with a black, necrotic center and raised erythematous edges. Which of the following toxins has a mechanism of action most similar to the toxin most likely responsible for this patient's skin lesion?",

      "H. Shigatoxin",
      "I. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins",
      "J. Tetanus toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient's wound is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the characteristic lesion described is called ecthyma gangrenosum. The Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which is responsible for the tissue damage, inhibits protein synthesis by acting on EF-2, with a primary target cell in the liver. The diphtheria toxin has a similar action, although its target cells are heart and nerve. Anthrax toxin (choice A) is a three-component toxin that contains a single binding component (protective antigen) and two active components. The edema factor (EF) is an adenylate cyclase that causes fluid loss from cells, and the lethal factor (LF) is an endoprotease that causes apoptosis. Botulinum toxin (choice B) is a neurotoxin that prevents neurosecretory vesicles from fusing with synaptic membranes and releasing acetylcholine. Cholera toxin (choice C) acts to increase adenylate cyclase activity by ribosylation of GTP-binding protein. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (choice D) is a lecithinase. Escherichia coli labile toxin (choice F) works in a fashion similar to the cholera toxin. Pertussis toxin (choice G) causes fluid loss by ribosylating Gi. Shigatoxin (choice H) decreases protein synthesis by inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins (choice I) act as superantigens to increase cytokine production. Tetanus toxin (choice J) is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA."

    "question": "A 4-year-old girl who recently emigrated from Somalia is brought fo the emergency department by her parents because of a fever and persistent cough. Her temperature is 40.1°C (104.2°F). Physical examination shows inspiratory stridor, and a thick, gray film covering the uvula and pharynx that bleeds when displaced with a tongue depressor. Cultures of the oropharyngeal secretions grow gram-positive rods. In the image above, the patient's isolate is strain 1. Which of the following best describes strain 1?",
    "options": [
      "A. It contains an episome",
      "B. It contains free plasmid DNA",
      "C. It contains a prophage",
      "D. It is not a diphtheroid",
      "E. It is a motile organism"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has developed diphtheria, which is rare in the United States because of our use of a very effective vaccine, the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis). Immigrant children from impoverished areas of the globe might not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is a gram-positive rod that is morphologically identical to normal flora organisms in the oropharynx, which are called diphtheroids. The difference between the pathogen and a normal flora diphtheroid is established using the ELEK test, which is shown in the image. This test involves diffusion in gel and a precipitation reaction that will occur when antigen (toxin) produced by the pathogen precipitates in the presence of antitoxin antibodies. In the image, the horizontal lines are the strains of bacteria to be tested for the production of the toxin. The vertical rectangle is a strip of filter paper that has been soaked in antitoxin antibodies. The white lines that form in the right angle where bacteria and filter paper meet are lines of precipitation. In C. diphtheriae, toxin production occurs following infection of the bacterium with a temperate phage that encodes the toxin. This is an example of lysogenic conversion. Episomes (choice A) are plasmids that have integrated into a bacterial chromosome; Diphtheria toxin is produced following stable integration of a phage genome into the chromosome, not due to the integration of plasmid DNA. Containing free plasmid DNA (choice B) is not the distinction between toxin-producing and non-producing strains of C. diphtheriae. The tetanus toxin is produced by virtue of possession of a non-conjugative plasmid by Clostridium tetani, but this is not true of diphtheria. It is not a diphtheroid (choice D). A diphtheroid is a non-toxin producing strain of C. diphtheriae (a normal flora organism). The strains that are streaked in the image as the two central lines are non-toxin producers (diphtheroids). It is a motile organism (choice E) is not the case and motility is not tested by the ELEK test. C. diphtheriae is a nonmotile organism, and the eventual development of peripheral neuropathies and cardiomyopathies during the pathogenesis are a result of the fact that the toxin becomes bloodborne, not that the organism moves from its site of residence in the oropharynx and upper airways."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man who is a farmer develops a pustule on the hand. The pustule ruptures to form a black eschar surrounded by expanding edema. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the development of these symptoms in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. A boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod",
      "B. A cigar-shaped yeast",
      "C. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine",
      "D. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining",
      "E. A large spirochete"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causative organism, Bacillus anthracis is found in many animal species, and humans can acquire the organism either through contact with animals or from locally contaminated soil. The pustule described in the question stem is called a 'malignant pustule' and may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy. Malignant pustules after rupture form a black eschar surrounded by edema. Most cases remain localized but death can occur as the result of complications such as bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Bacillus is a large, boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod that forms spores centrally placed inside the bacillus, so that they look like bamboo shoots. A cigar-shaped yeast (choice B) describes the tissue form of Sporothrix schenckii, the agent of rose-gardener's disease. The lesion in such a case would be a mycetoma, draining yellow granular pus through multiple sinus tracts. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine (choice C) describes Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. The organism can persist for weeks to months but does not form spores that could survive for hundreds or thousands of years. Most human cases occur in the endemic areas of the United States, in Arkansas and Missouri. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining (choice D) describes Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague. This organism does not form stable spores that can survive for extended periods of time. The hallmark of bubonic plague is the formation of buboes which are black, necrotic lymph nodes that form at the site of the vector fleabite. A large spirochete (choice E) describes Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme disease. In the first stage of this disease, there is a localized, expanding, erythematous rash rather than an eschar. Furthermore, Lyme disease occurs in the United States, Europe, and Asia, corresponding to the distribution of Ixodes ticks, which spread the infection."

    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative diplococci",
      "B. Gram-negative rods",
      "C. Gram-positive cocci",
      "D. Gram-positive rods",
      "E. Monomorphic yeast",
      "F. Septate hyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in this case are consistent with a fungal infection in the central nervous system (100-1000 cells, mostly lymphocytes, glucose <50 mg/dL, protein >=50 mg/dL). Cryptococcus is a monomorphic encapsulated yeast. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. While this patient is in the appropriate age group for meningococcal meningitis, his HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Gram-negative rods (choice B) would be indicative of any of the enteric organisms, particularly Escherichia coli. E. coli is an agent of neonatal meningitis and septicemia, but the patient's HIV status, age, and CSF findings refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) would be indicative of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of adult meningitis, but the CSF findings in this case refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive rods (choice D) would be indicative of Listeria monocytogenes, which also could be a feasible answer but again, the patient's HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Septate hyphae (choice F) would describe Aspergillus fumigatus, which is another fungal agent of meningitis in the immunocompromised, but it is not the most likely cause."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man develops malaise, fatigue, and anorexia after returning from a trip to Calcutta, India. His symptoms slowly resolve and he does not seek treatment. Three months later laboratory studies of serum show HBsAb Negative, HBeAb Positive, HBcAb Positive, HBeAg Negative, HBsAg Negative. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb is likely indicative of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. The patient has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B",
      "B. The patient is anergic to hepatitis B",
      "C. The patient is immune to hepatitis B",
      "D. The patient is in the window period",
      "E. The patient is making an excess of HBsAb"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has clearly returned from Calcutta with an active infection of hepatitis B, since his serum is positive for antibody against the core antigen of hepatitis B. This is the standard diagnostic for this infection. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb from the serum reflects that the patient has entered the 'window period,' a good prognostic indicator because it demonstrates that antibodies to the surface antigen are being made in enough concentration to precipitate the corresponding antigen out of the circulation. Successful vaccination against hepatitis B (choice A) would be reflected by a positive titer of HBsAb only. The presence of antibody against the e core antigen reflects the existence of an active infection. Anergy to hepatitis B (choice B) is not correct because a person who is anergic is selectively unresponsive or tolerant to the antigen in question. Clearly, the presence of antibodies to several of these viral antigens in the serum demonstrates that this patient is not anergic. Although the patient is beginning to mount a protective immune response (antibody to HBsAg, choice C), it has not yet reached a protective level. If the patient were making an excess of HBsAb (choice E), there would be a rising titer of HBsAb. Thus the patient would be positive for HBsAb and negative for HBsAg."

    "question": "An investigator is conducting a study of resistance of enterococcal species against penicillin and tetracycline. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for the acquisition of this type of multi-drug resistance?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacteriophage",
      "B. Exogenotes",
      "C. Prophage",
      "D. Restriction endonuclease",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Transposons are mobile segments of DNA that can move themselves or a copy of themselves from one molecule of DNA to another. They are found in eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. They need at least one gene coding for a transposase, which are the enzymes involved in this movement. The transposase recognizes a specific nucleotide sequence, and the DNA inserts into this position. This insertion creates direct repeats on each side of the transposon. Transposons include some genes for drug resistance and play an important role in building multiple-drug resistance plasmids. These multi-drug resistance plasmids have played a major role in the explosive spread of drug resistances throughout the bacterial world. Bacteriophages (choice A) are viruses that infect the bacterial cell. Temperate phage DNA may be inserted into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Imported bacterial DNA (i.e., DNA that has been transferred into a cell by conjugation, transformation, or transduction) is on short linear pieces of DNA called exogenotes (choice B). Most linear DNA is not stable in cells because it is broken down by exonucleases. Although technically all transferred DNA involved in emerging drug resistances is of exogenote origin, this is not the best answer because it is not specific enough. A prophage (choice C) is a repressed temperate phage DNA inserted into a bacterial chromosome. The prophage DNA may encode the synthesis of products that make bacteria more pathogenic. This enhanced virulence is called lysogenic conversion. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Restriction endonucleases (choice D) are site-specific endonucleases that recognize specific base sequences and cleave the nucleic acid backbone in the interior of the nucleic acid strand. Although restriction endonucleases are involved in transposon movement, they are not the means by which the drug resistances are acquired."

      "A. Image A",
      "B. Image B",
      "C. Image C",
      "D. Image D",
      "E. Image E"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has a fungus ball, or aspergilloma. These noninvasive or minimally locally invasive lesions are caused by Aspergillus species. They show saprophytic growth in preexisting lung cavities, which may be formed by tuberculosis, tumor, bronchiectasis, or other chronic lung infections. Patients are often asymptomatic but may become allergic to the fungus. Aspergillus fumigatus is a dematiaceous (dark-colored) fungus which forms hyphae that branch at acute angles. Choice A is an image of the arthroconidia of Coccidioides immitis. These are the infectious forms that are found in desert sand. Coccidioides causes San Joaquin Valley fever, which may be an acute or chronic pulmonary condition but is unlikely to invade cavitary lesions of the lung and cause fungus balls. Choice B is an image of the infectious form of Sporothrix schenckii that causes rose-gardener's disease. These are hyphae with sleeves of conidia that would be found in vegetative material in gardens worldwide. Sporothrix causes cutaneous or lymphocutaneous lesions associated with puncture wounds formed while gardening or handling plant material. Choice D is an image of germ tubes (pseudohyphae) formed by Candida albicans when it invades tissues. Candida is an opportunistic pathogen, but it does not cause fungus balls by invading cavitary lesions in the lung. Choice E is an image of the hyphae of the Zygomycophyta (Mucor, Rhizopus or Absidia) which cause rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and cancer patients."

      "D. Papillomavirus",
      "E. Parvovirus",
      "F. Poxvirus"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Examples of viruses in the Poxvirus family are variola, vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum. All DNA viruses are icosahedral, except for Poxviruses, which are described as brick-shaped complexes. Poxvirus DNA is enveloped. All DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the nucleus, except for Poxvirus, which replicates in the cytoplasm via a virion-associated transcriptase. All of the enzymes and factors necessary for viral replication are then made in the cytoplasm. Adenoviruses (choice A) like the other DNA viruses (except Poxvirus), are icosahedral and have double-stranded linear DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The DNA is not enveloped and there is no virion-associated polymerase. The main example of the Hepadnavirus (choice B) family is the hepatitis B virus. It is icosahedral and contains partially double-stranded circular DNA that is enveloped. Viruses carry a DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity to synthesize an RNA intermediate that is then used to make genomic DNA. Herpesviruses (choice C) consist of herpes simplex, varicella zoster, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus. These are icosahedral and contain enveloped double-stranded linear DNA. The DNA replicates in the nucleus and the virus is assembled in the nucleus. Papillomaviruses (choice D) are icosahedral and contain naked double-stranded circular DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The most important of the Parvoviruses (choice E) is parvovirus B19. It is icosahedral and is the only DNA virus that contains single-stranded DNA, which is naked and replicates in the nucleus."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has the signs and symptoms of a viral encephalitis. During the summer months, most types of viral encephalitis are transmitted by mosquitoes. Examples of arthropod-borne viruses include St. Louis virus, West Nile encephalitis virus (Flaviviridae), and Eastern equine, Western equine, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (Togaviridae). Herpes simplex encephalitis is actually the most common type of encephalitis in the United States, but it is transmitted by direct contact with infected tissues. If this had been a herpes simplex encephalitis, the lumbar puncture would have yielded a high opening pressure and multiple red blood cells would have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Aerosol (choice A) is the mechanism of transmission of most of the respiratory viruses. Fecal-oral transmission (choice C) is the most common means of infection with most gastroenteritis viruses. Most of these viruses are naked capsid viruses which are able to withstand passage through the acidity of the stomach. Parenteral transmission (choice D) is common among the enveloped viruses, which require direct transfusion or transplantation to cause disease. Sexual transmission (choice E) is common among the enveloped viruses, which are extremely fragile in the environment."

      "D. Mycobacterium scrofulaceum",
      "E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Despite the stress placed on the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex in discussions about HIV-infected patients, “ordinary” tuberculosis, caused by M. tuberculosis is the most prevalent form of mycobacterial infection at this point. M. avium-intracellulare complex infections usually do not predominate until the CD4 cell count has fallen well below 100/uL. It is also important to maintain a particularly high index of suspicion in AIDS patients, in whom the chest x-ray may be initially normal, possibly due to an impaired immune response. Some of these cases may clinically (and pathologically) resemble a more conventional bacterial pneumonia, because the body substitutes a comparatively ineffective neutrophil response for the granulomatous response it has trouble mounting. M. avium-intracellulare (choice A) are unusual mycobacterial infections that are noted for causing pulmonary and disseminated infections in AIDS patients, but they are less prevalent than M. tuberculosis except when the CD4+ count is less than 60/uL. M. leprae (choice B) causes leprosy. It is not an infection that is associated with HIV infection in the United States. M. marinum (choice C) can cause fish-tank granuloma (an ulcerating granuloma on the hands of tropical fish enthusiasts) when it enters through cuts in the skin in people who maintain home fish tanks. M. scrofulaceum (choice D) is a scotochromogen (produces carotenoid pigments in the dark) that causes solitary cervical lymphadenopathy in children exposed to contaminated water sources."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The photograph shows a stomach with a perforated peptic ulcer. Perforation of a peptic ulcer is potentially fatal, because of either peritonitis with sepsis or sudden exsanguination (if the perforation damages one of the many arteries of the stomach). Peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, possibly gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma have been strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori colonization of the mucus layer covering the gastric mucosa. The most important pathogenic attribute of H. pylori is its production of urease, which neutralizes the acidic pH of the stomach and allows the organism to invade the mucosal surface. The urease-positive organisms can be remembered with the mnemonic PUNCH: Proteus, Ureaplasma, Nocardia, Cryptococcus, Helicobacter. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with the urease breath test. Campylobacter jejuni (choice A) is also a gram-negative curved rod but is not associated with the formation of gastric ulcers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, anaerobic rod that is associated with gangrene and a mild form of food poisoning. Escherichia coli (choice C) is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod associated with many forms of gastroenteritis but not with gastric ulcer formation.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Composite viruses are viruses that are created in laboratories by artificially combining components of different parental viruses. In this case, the genetic material is DNA because the molluscum contagiosum virus is a double-stranded DNA virus in the poxvirus family. Thus the progeny viruses will have a double-stranded DNA genome.

The most common cause of meningitis in AIDS patients in the United States is Cryptococcus neoformans, which is an encapsulated, monomorphic yeast acquired from exposure to pigeon droppings. Although the USMLE likes to mention the India ink test of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in vignettes to avoid having to give away the diagnosis, India ink is not the preferred diagnostic test. The more sensitive test that is used in most hospital situations is latex particle agglutination to detect capsular antigens shed into the CSF. India ink (choice A), a test to diagnose cryptococcal infections, depends on the precipitation of a particulate dye around the capsular material of the organism. It misses about 50% of all infections. Molecular probes (choice C) are used in many diagnoses, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a variety of virus infections. It is not used for cryptococcal meningitis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (choice D) is used to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in infants. This assay detects integrated HIV (provirus). PCRs are available for other virus infections but are not used to diagnose cryptococcosis. Tzanck smear (choice E) is used to diagnose herpesvirus infections. It involves touching a slide or coverslip to a lesion to lift off the multinucleated giant cells caused by the infection."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman who recently emigrated from Southeast Asia comes to the emergency department because of severe right upper quadrant pain. An ultrasound of the gallbladder shows high echogenicity and she undergoes a cholecystectomy Examination of the gallbladder shows a large number of dark-colored, faceted stones with irregular shapes. Infection with which of the following organisms is most likely associated with this type of stone?",
    "options": [
      "A. Clonorchis sinensis",
      "B. Fasciolopsis buski",
      "C. Paragonimus westermani",
      "D. Schistosoma haematobium",
      "E. Taenia saginata"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The stones described are pigment stones, composed of relatively pure calcium bilirubinate. These stones are less common than cholesterol stones. Risk factors for pigment stones include hepatic cirrhosis (unclear mechanism), hemolytic anemias, and liver fluke infection, notably by the Oriental liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Fasciolopsis buski (choice B) is a large intestinal fluke that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal mucosal abscesses. Fasciola spp., not Fasciolopsis, are other liver flukes besides Clonorchis. Paragonimus westermani (choice C) is a lung fluke that can cause cough, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis. Schistosoma haematobium (choice D) is a blood fluke that tends to infect pelvic veins and may cause bladder disease (including cancer). Taenia saginata (choice E) is the beef tapeworm, and may cause intestinal obstruction."

Treatment with morphine is begun and the girl's symptoms are partially relieved. Physical examination shows a raised facial rash. A peripheral blood smear shows severe anemia, and a bone-marrow aspirate shows no erythroid precursor cells. Infection with which of the following is most likely responsible for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Coxsackie virus",
      "B. Echovirus",
      "C. Hepadnavirus",
      "D. Herpesvirus",
      "E. Parvovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses, of which only serotype B19 is pathogenic for humans. This virus causes three distinct syndromes: a childhood febrile rash known as erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), aplastic crisis in individuals with chronic hemolytic diseases (sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia, etc.), and congenital infections that can present as stillbirth, hydrops fetalis (analogous to severe Rh incompatibility), or severe anemia. Coxsackie viruses (choice A) usually cause coldlike illness, but can cause herpangina, myocarditis, and meningitis. Echoviruses (choice B) can infect a variety of organ systems (gastrointestinal, central nervous system, eyes, heart, respiratory, skin), but are not a cause of aplastic crises. Hepadnavirus (choice C) is the causative agent of hepatitis B. Herpesviruses (choice D) cause a variety of acute to chronic infections, including herpes simplex types 1 and 2, chickenpox, chronic herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus infection, and Epstein-Barr virus infections."

    "question": "A stable clone of bacteria that is susceptible to tetracycline is placed in culture with 10 bacteria that are resistant to tetracycline. Within 24 hours, all the bacteria in the culture are tetracycline-resistant. The genetic process by which this occurred is shown Which of the following best describes this process?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Homologous recombination",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The diagram shows the process of conjugation between an F+ donor and an F- recipient bacterium. This process transfers plasmids in their entirety from the donor to the recipient. The traits that will be transferred in this way are those encoded in the plasmid and all recipients will become donors in the process. Generalized transduction (choice B) can be accomplished by both lytic and temperative phage only during the lytic cycle. The process involves the phage mistakenly packaging bacterial DNA into the capsid and transferring the DNA to another bacterial cell. In this type of transduction any gene can be transferred. Homologous recombination (choice C) is not a mechanism of genetic transfer for bacteria but a mechanism by which bacterial nucleic acid is stabilized following transfer. Transformation, transduction, and Hfr conjugation are all followed by homologous recombination requiring recombinase A. Specialized transduction (choice D) can only be accomplished by a temperate phage in which there is an excision error during induction of the phage from the bacterial chromosome. In this case, bacterial nucleic acid is mistakenly excised along with phage DNA. Only certain genes (located next to the phage insertion sites) have an opportunity to be transferred. Transformation (choice E) is the uptake of naked DNA by certain 'competent' bacterial cells."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman develops a dry cough, fever, headache, and muscular pains. She has been treated unsuccessfully for the past 1 week with aspirin and ampicillin. Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath and worsening cough. An x-ray of the chest shows scattered interstitial opacities. Treatment with erythromycin is begun and her symptoms rapidly improve. Which of the following findings is most likely associated with the causal organism of patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cold agglutinins",
      "B. Dieterle silver staining",
      "C. Quellung reaction",
      "D. Requirement for cysteine",
      "E. Requirement for factors X and V"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient's clinical presentation is typical of primary atypical pneumonia. This type of pneumonia is typically caused by intracellular organisms such as viruses, or Chlamydiae, but since Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall, it does not elicit the characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate caused by most other bacteria. Because the patient's infection responded to erythromycin, it cannot have been caused by a virus; so the most likely causative agent is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A finding in about 65% of Mycoplasma patients is the production of cold agglutinins: IgM isohemagglutinins that will agglutinate autologous erythrocytes at 4°C (39.2°F). The Dieterle silver stain (choice B) is used to identify Legionella pneumophila, which is an agent of atypical pneumonia of the elderly but would be more likely in a smoker or immunosuppressed patient. Legionella would respond to erythromycin, but this patient is not immunocompromised. The Quellung reaction (choice C) is a technique used to identify the capsular serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium is the most common cause of adult typical pneumonia and would not cause the interstitial presentation described here. Requirement for cysteine (choice D) is a characteristic of four genera of bacteria: Francisella, Legionella, Brucella, and Pasteurella. Although Francisella, Legionella, and Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens that could cause atypical pneumonia, they would not be expected in this patient. Francisella is acquired from ticks or from handling infected reservoir animals. Brucella is acquired from contaminated dairy products or contact with animals. Legionella is a disease of elderly smokers who are immunosuppressed. Pasteurella is found in the mouths of many animals and is transmitted most commonly from cat bites. Requirement for factors X and V (choice E) is characteristic of Haemophilus. Haemophilus is an extracellular bacterium that causes otitis media, epiglottitis, pharyngitis and meningitis in unvaccinated children who are between 3 months and 2 years of age. It would not be expected in the present patient's age group."

    "options": [
      "A. 2-to-5-μm yeast with a thin cell wall but no true capsule",
      "B. 4-to-10-μm yeast with a broad, slimy capsule",
      "C. 10-to-60-μm yeast with multiple budding",
      "D. 20-to-50-μm nonbudding spherule filled with endospores",
      "E. Hyphae branching dichotomously at acute angles"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. A variety of fungi can produce acute or chronic lung disease like that described in this case history. They are distinguished by geographic incidence and examination of the sputum or biopsy. Histoplasma capsulatum which causes histoplasmosis, is observed most frequently in the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri river valleys of the United States (Central U.S.). The organism is a small (2-to-5-μm) intracellular yeast which, despite the name, has no true capsule. Calcifying lesions forming in the lungs are very suggestive of fungal infection. Blastomyces dermatitidis could cause similar presentation in this area, but it would be found in the sputum as a broad-based budding yeast, and that option is not available within the choices. Choice B describes Cryptococcus which is the most common cause of fungal meningitis in immunosuppressed patients notably those with AIDS or hematopoietic disorders. Choice C describes Paracoccidioides which can cause pulmonary disease in patients from South and Central America. Choice D describes Coccidioides, which can cause skin lesions or pulmonary disease in the desert southwest and far west of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever). Choice E describes Aspergillus an opportunistic fungus that can invade cavitary lesions in the lung and cause aspergilloma, or fungus ball."

    "question": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of fever, joint and muscle pain, photophobia, and malaise. He says that he felt well until 4 days ago, but now has a headache and has been vomiting. His temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). Physical examination shows no rash, ulceration, or petechiae Laboratory studies show an absolute leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased serum transaminases. A peripheral blood smear shows granulocytes that contain berry-like clusters of intracellular organisms. The vector for the causative agent of his illness is the same as that for which of the following organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "B. Francisella tularensis",
      "C. Plasmodium vivax",
      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has granulocytic ehrlichiosis, caused by Ehrlichia phagocytophila. This intracellular bacterium is transmitted by the Ixodes tick, which also transmits Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. The disease presents similarly to Rocky Mountain spotted fever but does not have a rash. The pathognomonic feature in this case history is the presence of morulae (berry-like clusters of organisms) inside the patient's granulocytes. Francisella tularensis (choice B) can be transmitted in a number of different ways, but when an arthropod is implicated, it is the Dermacentor tick. This is the same tick that transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Tularemia is an ulceroglandular disease with fever, ulcer at the bite site, and lymph node enlargement. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of most of the encephalitis viruses, all species of malaria parasites, dengue yellow fever, and filariasis. This patient clearly does not have encephalitis, and malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and filariasis would not be expected in a 16-year-old boy in the continental United States. Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) is the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and is transmitted by the Dermacentor tick. Rocky Mountain spotted fever has a characteristic rash that begins on the ankles and wrists progressing toward the trunk. The Weil-Felix test, which is a nonspecific test for antibodies that agglutinate Proteus organisms, would be positive. This tick also transmits Francisella tularensis but the symptoms of this patient are not consistent with either tularemia (an ulceroglandular disease) or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (choice E) is the agent of scrub typhus. It is transmitted by mites in the genus Leptotrombidium. Rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari) is also transmitted in this fashion, but both of these diseases are rare in the United States and would be characterized by rash and Weil-Felix test positivity."

    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a seizure. His mother says that he developed a fever, a severe prefrontal headache, and an altered sense of smell ten days after swimming in a lake near his camp. Physical examination shows a profuse green discharge from the nose. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 100 neutrophils, 50 lymphocytes, 30 mg/dL glucose, and 60 mg/dL protein. He dies two days after admission despite aggressive therapy Which of the following is most likely to be found on microscopic examination of the central nervous system at autopsy?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci",
      "B. Gram-positive, catalase-negative diplococci",
      "C. Motile flagellated trophozoites",
      "D. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies",
      "E. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles",
      "F. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has acquired primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri. This organism is a free-living ameba that is found in warm freshwater lakes. During the act of diving into such lakes, changes in pressure can force the organism through the cribriform plate and result in the production of necrotic lesions spreading from the olfactory lobes. The form of the organism that is found in human tissue is a flagellated trophozoite. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. This is a common cause of meningitis in young adults, but the case history would have to describe the presence of petechial hemorrhages from endotoxin toxicity. N. meningitidis overproduces outer membrane fragments and thus produces very early signs of endotoxin shock compared to other gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive catalase-negative diplococci (choice B) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although this is the most common cause of typical pneumonia, meningitis and sinusitis in the United States, it is not associated with swimming or diving, and the CSF would have shown extremely high numbers of neutrophils, low glucose, and high protein. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice D) describes cells infected with herpes simplex virus. This is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. It is not associated with swimming or diving. Although the CSF cell, protein, and glucose values could have indicated a viral etiology, herpes simplex encephalitis is also associated with a high opening pressure and the presence of many red blood cells. Encephalitis is also generally associated with confusion or change in mental status. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles (choice E) describes the zygomycophyta: bread mold fungi in the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, and Mucor. These agents can cause fatal rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and adults with cancer. The symptoms would be quite similar to those described in this case history, but these are opportunistic pathogens that do not cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts (choice F) describes Cryptococcus neoformans. This monomorphic fungus is the principal cause of meningitis in patients with Hodgkin disease or AIDS."

Which of the following tests will be most helpful in confirming the identity of the most likely causal agent of his fever and respiratory symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. CD4 cell count",
      "B. Direct fluorescent antibody test",
      "C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Western blot"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The most common atypical pneumonia in AIDS is caused by the atypical fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii). Patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia have great difficulty producing sputum, so bronchial lavage or transmural biopsy are generally required. The sample is then submitted to the direct fluorescent antibody test or stained with Gomori methenamine silver stain to visualize the organisms. The direct fluorescent antibody test is a technique to demonstrate the presence of antigen from a pathogen in a patient. Antigen-detecting tests will remain useful throughout the life of an AIDS patient because they do not depend on detection of the patient's immune response to the pathogen (which may be absent at the end of AIDS). When stained with methenamine silver, Pneumocystis cysts have a characteristic cup or boat shape; the individual cells are difficult to demonstrate without electron microscopy. CD4 cell count (choice A) is used to measure the progression of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since the virus infects and destroys these cells, the number remaining in the circulation becomes a good predictor of the progression of disease. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (choice C) is used as the screening test to diagnose HIV infection. It is a serologic test (i.e., identifies antibodies against the virus) and once the patient progresses into full-blown AIDS, antibody levels other than IgM will decline, so in general, serologic tests in late HIV infection tend to be less useful than tests that detect antigens from a pathogen. Polymerase chain reaction (choice D) is used to detect the viral load of the HIV virus in infected patients and infants. Western blot (choice E) is the confirmatory serologic test that is used in the diagnosis of HIV infection."

    "options": [
      "A. Cell wall",
      "B. Cytoplasmic membrane",
      "C. Flagella",
      "D. Outer surface protein",
      "E. Periplasmic space"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This woman has developed a positive tuberculin skin test indicating exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The molecule injected into the skin of the forearm to elicit this response is a purified protein derivative (PPD), which is composed of tuberculin (an outer surface protein) and mycolic acids of the organism. This is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction requiring sensitized TH1 cells. Only proteins can evoke such responses, since T cells are only capable of recognizing peptides presented to them in the context of an MHC molecule. The cell wall (choice A) of mycobacteria contains a thinner-than-normal layer of peptidoglycan and mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids. However, this material is not proteinaceous and therefore does not stimulate the TH1 cells necessary for the formation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The cytoplasmic membrane (choice B) of mycobacteria is a phospholipid bilayer that is similar to the inner membranes of all other prokaryotes and does not contribute to the specific skin test for tuberculosis. Flagella (choice C) are not present on M. tuberculosis because the organism is not motile. M. tuberculosis does not possess a periplasmic space (choice E) because it is an organism that is taxonomically related to the gram-positives. Only gram-negative bacteria possess a periplasmic space."

Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the brain shows demyelination with abnormal giant oligodendrocytes, some of which contain eosinophilic inclusions. This patient's condition occurs most commonly in association with which of the following diseases?",

      "A. AIDS",
      "B. Chickenpox",

      "D. Multiple sclerosis",
      "E. Rabies",
      "F. Syphilis",
      "G. Tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rapidly progressive demyelinating disorder in which the JC virus (a polyomavirus) infects oligodendroglial cells in the brain. The eosinophilic inclusions represent accumulations of JC virus. PML occurs in about 1% of AIDS patients, and is the AIDS-defining illness in half of the patients who develop the condition. Symptoms include aphasia, hemiparesis, cortical blindness, ataxia, and conjugate gaze abnormalities. The condition can progress to quadriparesis and coma. There is no effective treatment for this disorder. Shingles and postinfectious encephalitis can follow chickenpox (choice B) but varicella is not specifically associated with demyelination. Measles (choice C) can cause an encephalitis and, in some cases, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) may follow previous measles infection. These disorders would affect not only white matter but gray matter as well. Also, SSPE usually occurs before the age of 18. Multiple sclerosis (choice D) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease characterized by demyelination. The immunologic basis of the pathology appears to be that TH1 lymphocytes reactive against myelin stimulate macrophages to destroy the myelin. It is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity response. Women are affected twice as often as men. The disease tends to have a relapsing and remitting course and may involve visual impairment, cranial nerve signs, ataxia, nystagmus, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Spinal cord lesions give rise to motor and sensory difficulties of the trunk and limbs, and spasticity and loss of control of bladder function. Rabies (choice E) produces eosinophilic inclusions (Negri bodies) in the brain but these are found in the gray matter. Signs of rabies would include excessive salivation, hallucinations, and hydrophobia. Syphilis (choice F) can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord damage, but the disease process would not be limited to the white matter. Tuberculosis (choice G) can cause a granulomatous meningitis, typically affecting the base of the brain."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The patient is suffering from conjunctivitis caused by Haemophilus, a fastidious organism requiring factors V (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and X (hematin), which must be released from whole-blood preparations to be accessible to the organism. This can be done by gentle heating, which lyses the red blood cells, or by co-culture with Staphylococcus aureus, which is beta-hemolytic and lyses the red blood cells to provide the factors Haemophilus needs for growth. This is called the satellite phenomenon. Antibiotics (choice A) would not be necessary since, with proper culture techniques, no normal flora should be available to confuse the diagnosis of conjunctivitis. Antibiotics and antifungals are added to chocolate agar to create Thayer-Martin medium to prevent the growth of normal flora when culturing from the genital tract. Cold temperature (choice B) would not be necessary because Haemophilus grows at normal body temperature. Listeria is the genus commonly mentioned for which a cold temperature is necessary. Cholesterol (choice C) is necessary for the growth of Mycoplasma but not Haemophilus. Low oxygen tension (choice D) is necessary for the growth of the microaerophiles (such as Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Borrelia), but is not a condition for growth of Haemophilus."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This woman has developed a pulmonary abscess, as evidenced by the chest radiograph. Of the organisms listed, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely cause of bacterial pneumonia complicated by abscess formation. Bacteria that commonly produce pneumonia that develops in the context of influenza include Staph. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of these, Staph. aureus is most destructive to lung tissue and likely to cause cavitary lesions. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus (choice A) describes Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium would be a cause of pneumonia in alcoholic or diabetic patients, or in those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A gram-positive catalase-negative alpha-hemolytic diplococcus (choice B) describes Strep. pneumoniae. This agent causes a necrotizing abscessing pneumonia with appearance similar to that of Staph. aureus, but it rarely causes cavitary lesions. A silver-staining cyst (choice D) describes Pneumocystis jiroveci. This agent is associated with atypical pneumonia in the immunocompromised or in premature infants.

Fever, malaise, headache, and myalgia may also be present, particularly in the prodromal phase. Tzanck smear of the base of a vesicle may demonstrate multinucleated giant cells. Immunocompromised patients can be treated with acyclovir to prevent dissemination. Chickenpox may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, systemic spread (immunosuppressed patients), neurologic involvement (rare), Reye syndrome (rare), and/or hemolytic anemia (rare). Genital vesicles and ulcers (choice A) are associated with herpes simplex type 2. Infectious mononucleosis (choice B) is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus.

Treatment with penicillin derivatives (ampicillin) leads to a maculopapular rash. Chest x-ray (choice A) is useful for a respiratory or cardiac process. Infectious mononucleosis cannot be diagnosed by any radiographic study. ELISA (choice B) would be a useful screening test for a variety of infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A lateral x-ray of the neck (choice D) is useful in acute epiglottitis; it would show epiglottic swelling. The symptoms of epiglottitis include extreme sore throat, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. A rapid antigen test (choice E) is used to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is characterized by fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A scarlatiniform rash may follow the pharyngitis. The rash, a diffuse erythema that later desquamates, is caused by an erythrotoxin. Antibodies to the varicella virus (choice F) can be detected by immunofluorescence. The symptoms of varicella include a vesicular rash (in various stages of evolution), fever, and malaise. The treatment is bathing soaks and antipruritic topical medication. Treatment with aspirin has been associated with Reye syndrome and should therefore be avoided."

    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a fever, nausea, diarrhea, and a rash. Her last menstrual period began 3 days ago. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a diffuse erythematous rash with areas of desquamation over the hands and feet. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, nonfermenting, nonmotile, non-H₂S-producing bacillus",
      "B. Gram-positive anaerobic rod",
      "C. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus",
      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus",
      "E. Single-stranded diploid RNA virus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a multisystem syndrome caused by a toxin (TSST-1) formed by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. TSS usually affects several organ systems (gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary) and can result in death. TSS has historically been associated with the use of tampons in young women, but can also occur in other patient populations. Fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and diffuse rash with desquamation of the hands and feet are common symptoms. Management of shock, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a priority if these conditions are present, in addition to appropriate antibacterial treatment. S. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting, nonmotile, non-H₂S-producing bacillus (choice A) describes the genus Shigella, which causes dysentery, characterized by fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea. A gram-positive anaerobic rod (choice B) describes Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene with necrosis of soft tissues, usually after a traumatic wound. It is also a cause of food poisoning. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus (choice D) describes Staph. epidermidis, which is part of the normal skin flora but is notorious for causing infections of intravenous lines and prosthetic heart valves. A single-stranded diploid RNA virus (choice E) describes the retroviruses. Although HIV-1 can cause many diverse findings and should never be immediately ruled out, the findings in the present patient are most specific for TSS."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of fever, myalgias, and cough He owns an automobile repair shop and recently cleaned his garage, which was infested with mice. He is tachypneic and must use accessory respiratory muscles to breathe. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "A. California encephalitis",
      "B. Cytomegalovirus",
      "C. Hantavirus",
      "D. Plague",
      "E. Poliovirus",
      "F. Rabies",
      "G. Tularemia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, first reported in 1993, consists of fever, myalgia, and rapid development of respiratory failure leading to death. The initial cases were mostly among Navajo Indians, however, cases have been documented in many U.S. states and in Canada. It is most common in the U.S. Four Corners states: New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. The causative agent is a hantavirus belonging to the family Bunyaviridae. The virus has also been called the Sin Nombre (Spanish for 'without a name') virus. Infection is thought to be through inhalation of aerosolized secretions from the common deer mouse. The disease typically begins with a nonspecific prodrome (fever, generalized myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances) followed 4 to 5 days later by respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea). This progresses rapidly to an adult respiratory distress syndrome and, in many cases, death. California encephalitis (choice A) is caused by an arbovirus transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Most cases are in children younger than 10 years of age. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Myalgias and arthralgias are typically present. Seizure activity is most frequently observed in infants and young children. Most cases are in the midwestern United States. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (choice B) is a Herpesvirus that produces a variety of infections. Primary CMV infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients, but can cause a heterophile-negative mononucleosis syndrome. Perinatal infections can occur in utero, intrapartum, or postpartum, and can produce congenital malformations. CMV can be transmitted by leukocytes in blood transfusions. In patients with AIDS or other immunosuppressive states, CMV can produce severe disease, including retinitis, pneumonia, encephalitis, adrenalitis, and gastrointestinal tract ulcerations. Plague (choice D) is caused by Yersinia pestis. It is endemic in the desert southwest of the United States, but plague normally begins with an extremely high fever, conjunctivitis, and septicemia. If it is acquired by fleabite, then buboes (hemorrhagic lymph nodes) will be found; if it is acquired in the pneumonic form, then cough will be observed. Poliovirus (choice E) is a member of the Picornavirus family. It remains epidemic in parts of Asia and Africa even though the wild type has been eliminated from the western hemisphere. The virus affects cranial nerve nuclei and anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, producing a flaccid paralysis that is usually asymmetric. Vaccine-related polio can occur with the live virus vaccine. Rabies (choice F) is a Rhabdovirus that produces encephalitis and/or myelitis. It should be considered in persons who have recently traveled outside of the United States. The most common sources of exposure are dogs, cats, skunks, foxes, raccoons (in Florida and Connecticut), wolves, and bats. The infection is acquired from the bite of a rabid animal or by inhalation. Rabies also has been reported to occur in patients after corneal transplantation. The virus spreads along peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. Symptoms include hallucinations, hydrophobia and copious salivation. Tularemia (choice G) is caused by Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative, cysteine-requiring facultative intracellular bacillus. The disease is most common in Arkansas and Missouri, and is acquired by handling, ingesting, or inhaling material from infected reservoir animals such as deer, rabbits and small rodents. It may also be transmitted by ticks from one of the reservoir animals to humans. Tularemia is generally characterized by disseminated granulomatous lesions, and would not be expected to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome."

    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of a headache and a high fever. He recently returned from a 2-week trip to Europe where he went diving in several natural pools. A diagnosis of meningoencephalitis localized to the base of his brain is made. A photomicrograph of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is shown. Through which of the following structures did the causal organism most likely gain access to the brain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cavernous sinus",
      "B. Cribriform plate",
      "C. Lacrimal bone",
      "D. Mandible",
      "E. Nasal bone",
      "F. Zygomatic bone"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The rare but life-threatening meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri apparently ensues when the organism enters the body through the nasal mucosa and crosses the cribriform plate to enter the brain via the olfactory nerves. It has been speculated that changes in pressure created during diving predispose to this infection. The cavernous sinus (choice A) is the site of entry of the zygomycophyta (Rhizopus, Mucor or Absidia) into the brain in diabetic ketoacidotic patients or adults with cancer. The lacrimal bone (choice C) of the medial aspect of the orbit does not appear to be involved in amebic infection. The mouth and its associated bones, including the mandible (choice D), do not appear to be routes of infection for this organism. The nasal bones (choice E) located on the superior surface of the nose, do not appear to be a route of infection for this organism. The zygomatic bone (choice F) which forms the cheekbone, does not appear to be a route of infection for this organism."

    "question": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of malaise, loss of appetite. nausea. and jaundice. Laboratory studies show a serum alanine transaminase (ALT) of 3,200 U/L. Serology for hepatitis viruses is performed and shows the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM antibody Antibody tests for HBsAb and HAV are negative. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these results?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute HBV infection",
      "B. A dual infection of HBV and HAV",
      "C. Chronic hepatitis B infection",
      "D. Immunity to hepatitis B virus",
      "E. Past hepatitis A infection"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) along with hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM Ab), and the absence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), indicate the early stages of an acute infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). A dual infection of HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (choice B) is not plausible since the IgM anti-HAV serology is negative. Chronic HBV infection (choice C) is unlikely because the patient has HBc IgM Ab, which is characteristic of an acute infection rather than a chronic infection. Immunity to HBV (choice D) is not plausible due to the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM Ab and the lack of HBsAb. Past hepatitis A infection (choice E) would be manifested by the presence of IgG antibodies against HAV."

An x-ray of the chest shows multiple patchy infiltrates in both lung fields An echocardiogram shows damage to the tricuspid valve. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacterial endocarditis",
      "B. Congenital heart disease",
      "C. Rheumatic fever",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has acute infective endocarditis. The most common cause of acute bacterial endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus. This type of endocarditis is typically acquired by illicit intravenous drug use, which can introduce skin organisms into the venous system that then attack the tricuspid valve. Staph. aureus accounts for between 60 and 90% of cases of endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Damage to the tricuspid valve is common. The endocarditis associated with congenital heart disease (choice B) typically involves either damaged valves or atrial or ventricular septal defects. The tricuspid valve is not particularly vulnerable. Rheumatic fever (choice C) most commonly damages the mitral and aortic valves, and tricuspid damage is usually less severe and seen only when the mitral and aortic valves are heavily involved. Rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) is not associated with bacterial endocarditis. Systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) can produce small, aseptic vegetations on the ventricular and atrial surfaces of the mitral valve (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)."

      "C. Non-pilus adhesins",
      "D. Pili",
      "E. Pneumolysin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common causes of otitis media in children are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In a vignette that gives no Gram stain or culture characteristics, the answer should refer to the number one cause, in this case Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most important virulence factor in Strep. pneumoniae is the capsule, which protects against phagocytosis. Lipopolysaccharide (choice B) is present in all gram-negative bacteria and would not be found in Strep. pneumoniae which is gram-positive. Non-pilus adhesins (choice C) exist in many organisms, and mediate adherence to the epithelial surfaces. For example, hemagglutinin molecules of bacteria and viruses fit this definition, and some toxins like the pertussis toxin have adhesive abilities. Pili (choice D) are glycoprotein “hairs” which mediate attachment to the epithelium. In gram-positives such as this one they are referred to as fimbriae and in gram-negatives they are extremely important virulence factors in allowing colonization of the uroepithelium by Escherichia coli, for example. Pneumolysin (choice E) is a cytotoxin produced by Strep. pneumoniae which destroys ciliated epithelial cells."

      "A. Flea",
      "B. Louse",
      "C. Mosquito",
      "D. Reduviid bug",
      "E. Tick"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has myocarditis due to Trypanosoma cruzi. This infectious condition, known as Chagas disease, is endemic in vast areas of South America and is transmitted from person to person by the reduviid bug, also known as the 'kissing bug'. Experts assess the number of persons with Chagas disease at about 7 million, with about 35 million at risk in South America. T. cruzi is an intracellular protozoan that localizes mainly in the heart and nerve cells of the myenteric plexus, leading to myocarditis and dysmotility of hollow organs, such as the esophagus, colon, and ureter. Cardiac involvement manifests with ventricular dilatation and congestive heart failure secondary to myocyte necrosis and fibrosis. Intracellular parasites can be visualized in tissue sections. Chagas disease is a cause of acquired achalasia, in which the distal third of the esophagus dilates because of loss of its intrinsic innervation. A similar pathologic mechanism accounts for megacolon and megaureter in Chagas disease. The flea (choice A) is the vector for Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. The louse (choice B) is the vector for Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus. The mosquito (choice C) is the vector for many of the Arboviruses that cause encephalitis. West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis are examples. Ticks (choice E) are the vectors for Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia, Rickettsia rickettsii, for example."

    "question": "A strain of Escherichia coli is resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, ampicillin, kanamycin, and neomycin Another strain of the same bacteria is not resistant to any of these drugs. When 100 bacteria from the resistant strain are added to a flask of bacteria of the sensitive strain and incubated overnight, all the bacteria in the flask develop resistance to the full complement of antibiotics Which of the following best explains these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation",
      "B. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction",
      "C. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction",
      "D. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation",
      "E. Transfer of multiple drug-resistance plasmids via conjugation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli are well known for their ability to transfer multiple-drug resistances during a single conjugative event. When these resistance genes become accumulated on a plasmid capable of mediating conjugation (a fertility factor), all drug-resistance genes are transferred efficiently and swiftly to the other partner of conjugation. Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation (choice A) would not be likely to have the same level of efficiency as that described in the question stem. Although the Hfr cell transfers some DNA via conjugation, it transfers chromosomal DNA, not plasmid DNA. Because the chromosome is so much larger, the exchange is never complete, and only some genes can be successfully transferred in each conjugative event. Because all the sensitive bacteria in this experiment acquired all the drug-resistance genes, it is unlikely that these were all chromosomal genes. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction (choice B) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Generalized transduction is the mechanism by which a lytic phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction (choice C) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Specialized transduction is the mechanism by which a temperate phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation (choice D) requires the uptake of free DNA from the environment by competent cells. It is not likely that such a large amount of DNA could be transferred in this way with 100% efficiency."

    "options": [
      "A. Bacillus cereus",
      "B. Clostridium perfringens",
      "C. Escherichia coli",
      "D. Shigella sonnei",
      "E. Staphylococcus aureus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxin A, which is the likely contaminant that was present in the pastries. When ingested, the toxin causes severe nausea and vomiting within a few hours (average incubation time: 3-6 hours). There is little diarrhea associated with this type of food-poisoning outbreak. Bacillus cereus (choice A) is a gram-positive, spore-forming rod that is associated with food-poisoning outbreaks following the ingestion of rice served in buffet-style restaurants. The time of onset and the symptoms would mimic staphylococcal disease; the major differentiating feature is the food involved. This organism survives the boiling of the rice because it is a spore-former. It germinates as the rice cools, then it grows and elaborates an enterotoxin. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe that can cause a longer incubation (8-to-24-hour) food poisoning, typically with marked diarrhea. Once again, the spores allow the organism to survive the heating process used in the preparation of the food. C. perfringens is associated with re-heated meat dishes. The symptoms of Escherichia coli (choice C) food poisoning are usually watery diarrhea (traveler's diarrhea) with minimal nausea and vomiting, or a bloody diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive strains of the agent. Shigella sonnei (choice D) causes enterocolitis characterized by fever cramps, and diarrhea after an incubation period of 1 to 4 days. Transmission is fecal-oral, associated with poor hygiene. A wide range of foods has been implicated."

      "F. Pleomorphic gram-negative rods in parallel short chains",
      "G. Spirochetes visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. This is a typical case description of chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, a pleomorphic, gram-negative rod that displays a characteristic pattern ('school of fish') on Gram-stained slides. It grows on chocolate agar or on whole blood agar with a satellite phenomenon (around Staphylococcus aureus). Treat with azithromycin or ceftriaxone. Encapsulated bacteria inside mononuclear cells (choice A) describes Klebsiella granulomatis, the agent of granuloma inguinale. This disease is rare in the United States and would be expected most commonly in the tropics of Africa. It is generally a painless genital or perianal lesion that begins as a beefy-red bump and then breaks into granulation tissue that bleeds easily. Epithelial cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice B) are found with herpes simplex infections but these lesions would be vesicular and painful. Iodine-staining intracellular inclusion bodies (choice C) would be found during infections with Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of lymphogranuloma venereum, but this lesion is generally nonpainful. It is associated with lymphadenopathy and genital elephantiasis. Koilocytotic squamous epithelial cells (choice D) are found in infections with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is associated with genital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and penile cancer. Neutrophils containing gram-negative diplococci (choice E) would be found if this were gonorrhea. However, in gonorrhea, the patient would have a leukorrheic urethral discharge, and not the ulcerative genital lesion described here. Spirochetes (choice G) would be found on darkfield microscopy if this were a case of syphilitic chancre but that chancre would be hard and nontender."

      "B. The child has been exposed to a child with chickenpox",
      "C. The child has been exposed to a grandparent with shingles",
      "D. The rash is a normal side effect of the MMR",
      "E. The vaccine was contaminated with live virus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The rash shown in the image is clearly unilateral and follows a dermatome, which is diagnostic of the rash of shingles, the second manifestation of infection with the varicella zoster virus. After the initial episode of chickenpox (primary infection), the varicella zoster virus develops a latent infection in the sensory ganglia. If the latent virus is reactivated, shingles develops. The majority of cases of chickenpox present in children, who will show an asynchronous pruritic rash consisting of papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusted lesions in crops in various stages. Shingles mainly presents in the elderly population as unilateral painful vesicles restricted to one dermatome. When shingles occurs in young children such as this one, it is typically due to the fact that the initial exposure to varicella zoster happened during a period of time when the child was passively protected by maternal antibodies acquired across the placenta or in breast milk. Because the child does not develop a robust active response to this infection, reactivational disease tends to onset at earlier than the normal age. Exposure of a 'naive' individual to chickenpox (choice B) or to shingles (choice C) would result in a case of chickenpox, which has different symptomatology from that described. The MMR is an attenuated live virus vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella. Adverse reactions to the MMR include fever, arthralgia and rash, but the rash shown here is clearly shingles, which is caused by varicella zoster virus (choice D). Contamination with live virus (choice E) is not a possibility because any contamination of the MMR vaccine with varicella zoster virus would have resulted in a case of chickenpox, not shingles."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A,B, Ba and C) causes a conjunctival and corneal infection that is spread in developing countries by eye-seeking flies and hand-to-eye contact. The lesions begin with formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva. With disease progression, there is tissue necrosis, granulation tissue deposition, and scar formation, leading to lacrimal duct obstruction and distortion of the eyelids. The organism is an obligate intracellular parasite spread from human to human in a metabolically inactive, extracellular form called an elementary body. The form that would be grown in tissue culture cells is the reticulate body. Elementary bodies (choice A) are the infectious form but are metabolically inactive and cannot be cultured. Gram-negative diplococcus (choice B) describes Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can cause ophthalmia neonatorum but would not cause pannus formation and scarring. Gram-positive coccus (choice C) could describe Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause conjunctivitis but not pannus formation and scarring.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has floppy-baby syndrome, caused by ingestion of the spores of Clostridium botulinum, germination of the organism in the gut of the infant, and subsequent production of the botulinum toxin, which causes a flaccid paralysis by blocking release of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The genetic coding for production of this neurotoxin is found in the genome of a lysogenic phage, and therefore is produced only in virus-infected bacterial cells. Other medically important attributes that are encoded in this way include the cholera toxin, Shiga toxin, O antigen of Salmonella, the erythrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes, and the diphtheria toxin. The bacterial chromosome (choice A) is the location of all essential genes in the bacterium. Loss of any essential gene will result in the death of the organism. Although most exotoxins are encoded on bacterial plasmids, endotoxin production is chromosomally encoded. An episome (choice B) is a plasmid that has become stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome. This is the mechanism by which Hfr cells arise in nature but is not known to play a role in exotoxin production in bacteria. Plasmids (choice D) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that replicate autonomously and carry genes for most exotoxins, fertility factors, and most antibiotic resistances. The botulinum toxin, the erythrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes and the diphtheria toxin are not encoded on plasmids but in the genomes of lysogenic phages. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are capable of mediating their own movement within and between strands of DNA inside cells. Transposition is believed to be responsible for the arising of multiple-drug resistance plasmids but is not believed to play a role in exotoxin production."

In infants, coxsackie A can cause disseminated disease involving multiple organs, but unlike cytomegalovirus (the most common cause of disseminated fetal infections in the U.S.), coxsackie virus infections will typically resolve without sequelae. The coxsackie viruses (as well as poliovirus, echoviruses, and rhinoviruses) are Picornaviruses that are composed of single-stranded linear positive-sense RNA. The virus particles are non-enveloped, 27-nm icosahedrons with 60 subunits that replicate in the cytoplasm. The mnemonic for remembering the Picornaviruses is 'PEECoRNA viruses': Polio, Entero, Echo, Coxsackie, Rhino, hep A. The mnemonic for remembering the positive-sense RNA viruses is 'Call Henry, Pico and Flo To Come Right away': Calicivirus, Hepevirus, Picornavirus, Flavivirus, Togavirus, Coronavirus, Retrovirus. Poxviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses have double-stranded DNA (choice A). Of these, molluscum contagiosum (poxvirus) causes umbilicated warts; herpes 6 causes roseola infantum, which is a mild febrile disease followed by a rash; and adenoviruses cause conjunctivitis, pharyngoconjunctivitis, upper respiratory disease, and gastroenteritis. None of these would be compatible with the stem in this case. Reoviruses have double-stranded RNA (choice B) and include rotaviruses which cause prolonged, watery diarrhea in infants. Parvoviruses have single-stranded DNA (choice C) and include B19 virus, the cause of erythema infectiosum (slapped cheek disease) in school age children. Orthomyxoviruses have single-stranded, negative-sense RNA (choice D) and include influenza virus, which causes fever, myalgia, cough, and malaise."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police after being found staggering in the streets. His rectal temperature is 38.8°C (101.6°F), and he smells of wine His coughing produces thick, bloody sputum. Physical examination shows dullness to percussion, increased vocal fremitus, decreased breath sounds, and wet crackles over the right lung field A chest x-ray shows consolidation of the right upper lobe Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus",
      "B. A gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus",
      "C. A gram-negative, pleomorphic bacillus requiring factors X and V",
      "D. A gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus",
      "E. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This man has pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae as suggested by his alcoholism, lobar consolidation, and 'currant jelly' sputum. Klebsiella is a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae, so it is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus. A gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus (choice B) describes Pseudomonas aeruginosa which may cause pneumonia but would be more likely in a patient with cystic fibrosis than in an alcoholic. The sputum would have a blue-green color and a fruity odor. A gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus requiring factors X and V (choice C) describes Haemophilus influenzae. It is a cause of pneumonia, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and otitis media, but does not typically cause lobar consolidation or bloody sputum. A gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus (choice D) describes the genus Streptococcus, of which S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in adults (including alcoholics). The sputum of streptococcal pneumonia, however is 'rusty' or tinged with brown blood, not bright red and gelatinous as described here. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus (choice E) describes the genus Staphylococcus, of which S. aureus is a common cause of pneumonia. It is most commonly associated with aspiration pneumonia in alcoholics but causes a salmon-colored sputum, not one that is bright red and gelatinous."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man comes to the physician because of chronic, symmetric arthritis of the knees. He developed an extensive rash after a deer-hunting trip several years ago. He says that he felt 'sick' at that time, and developed knee pain that prevented him from climbing stairs for several months, but the pain has partially resolved. Which of the following is likely to be part of this patient's past medical history?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aplastic crisis",
      "B. Bell palsy",
      "C. Erythema nodosum",
      "D. Pharyngitis",
      "E. Urethral discharge"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This history is characteristic for Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The clues are deer, rash, knees, and acute arthritis followed by chronic arthritis. The first sign of disease is typically a migrating red rash in the shape of concentric rings (erythema migrans), and this stage is frequently followed by neurologic symptoms such as Bell palsy. This may be followed by signs of cardiac arrhythmia or pericarditis, and finally by arthritis and arthralgias, which are believed to be immune complex-mediated. Aplastic crisis (choice A) is caused by parvovirus B19 in patients with sickle-cell anemia. It is not associated with Lyme disease. Erythema nodosum (choice C) or desert bumps, are caused by Coccidioides immitis in the desert of the U.S. Southwest. These symptoms are not associated with Lyme disease. Pharyngitis (choice D) is not a common finding in Lyme disease, although other influenza-like symptoms may occur, such as fever, chills, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and musculoskeletal pain. Urethral discharge (choice E) would not be expected with Lyme disease, but if you thought the arthritis was caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, this answer would have been appropriate."

    "question": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. Gynecologic examination shows several raised verrucous lesions of the vulva. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the lesion shows a tree-like proliferation of the epithelium associated with a fibrous stroma. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on a Pap smear?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cowdry type A inclusions",
      "B. Guarnieri bodies",
      "C. Koilocytes",
      "D. Negri bodies",
      "E. Owl's-eye inclusions"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV causes infected cells to have an enlarged nucleus and perinuclear vacuolization. These cells are called koilocytic cells, which are diagnostic for HPV. Cowdry type A inclusions (choice A) are diagnostic for herpesviruses. Herpes simplex virus causes vesicular lesions. Guarnieri bodies (choice B) are intracytoplasmic inclusions diagnostic for poxviruses. Of these, molluscum contagiosum can produce genital warts, but these warts are friable and umbilicated and would not have the fibrous stroma described here. Negri bodies (choice D) are diagnostic for rabies virus. They are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions in neurons, and would not be associated with warts. Owl's-eye inclusions (choice E) are basophilic intranuclear inclusions with clearing around them that are diagnostic for cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus is not associated with warts."

Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the mass shows multiple tiny oval forms within macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Blastomycosis",
      "B. Coccidioidomycosis",
      "C. Histoplasmosis",
      "D. Paracoccidioidomycosis",
      "E. Sporotrichosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Histoplasmosis is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus that grows as a mold in the wild but as a tiny yeast inside macrophages in humans. The disease is typically asymptomatic or mild enough to go undetected, but when symptomatic it presents with cough, fever, and malaise. It is commonly seen in geographic areas surrounding the central riverbeds of the United States. The primary and secondary treatments of choice for uncomplicated histoplasmosis are itraconazole and fluconazole, respectively. More serious cases are treated with amphotericin B. Blastomycosis (choice A) is characterized by a larger, round, budding yeast form, seen free in the tissues. Coccidioidomycosis (choice B) is seen mainly in the desert parts of the southwestern United States. In the lungs, spherules containing endospores are seen. Paracoccidioidomycosis (choice D) is endemic in Latin America, especially in Brazil. The infected cells show a typical 'pilot's wheel' appearance due to multiple yeasts sprouting out of a single parent cell. Sporotrichosis (choice E) most often produces a localized cutaneous infection, following inoculation occurring in association with minor skin trauma during gardening."

    "question": "A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of multiple blister-like lesions on the glans of the penis. He has had 2 episodes of similar symptoms during the past 2 years. Physical examination shows tender, 3-to-4-mm vesicles on the shaft of the penis with no crusting, drainage, or bleeding There is also mild bilateral inguinal adenopathy Which of the following best describes the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. The agent becomes latent in B cells",
      "B. The agent becomes latent in mononuclear cells",
      "C. The agent becomes latent in the dorsal root ganglia",
      "D. The agent becomes latent in the sacral ganglia",
      "E. The agent becomes latent in trigeminal ganglia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is a classic example of an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV, probably type 2). This agent causes lytic infections in mucoepithelial cells. It then moves by retrograde transport into neurons of the sacral ganglia, where it lies dormant during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. The Tzanck smear is a diagnostic test involving the touching of a microscope slide to a vesicular lesion. Multinucleated giant cells will be lifted off onto the slide and can be stained and identified as having a herpesvirus origin. B cells (choice A) are the site of latency for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Mononuclear cells (choice B) are the site of latency for cytomegalovirus (CMV). The dorsal root ganglia (choice C) are the sites of latency for varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles. Since the present lesions are on the genitalia, the virus would move into latency in the sacral ganglia, not the trigeminal ganglia (choice E). HSV introduced into the oral mucosa becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglia."

    "question": "An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of crampy abdominal pain, nausea, and mild diarrhea for the past 2 weeks. Her mother states that the girl vomited a 10-cm (4-inch) long cylindrical white worm 24 hours ago. Which of the following best describes the most likely route of infection in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Autoinfection",
      "B. Ingestion of cysts in contaminated water",
      "C. Ingestion of eggs from an infected pet",
      "D. Ingestion of eggs from human feces",
      "E. Mosquito transmission of larvae",
      "F. Skin penetration of larvae"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is a case of Ascaris lumbricoides infection, the only helminth infection caused by a cylindrical white worm of this remarkably large size. It is acquired directly with no intermediate host, from fecal contamination from other human beings, and the stage of the life cycle that is transmitted is the egg. Autoinfection (choice A) is a rare occurrence in helminthic infections, possible only with Strongyloides stercoralis (the threadworm), Enterobius vermicularis (the pinworm), and Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm). Ingestion of cysts in contaminated water (choice B) is the normal mechanism of infection used by intestinal protozoa. There are no helminthic infections in the United States that are transmitted via cysts in water. Ingestion of eggs from an infected pet (choice C) occurs in visceral larva migrans when the ascarids of dogs and cats infect the human, an aberrant host. It would never result in the introduction of an adult worm into the vomitus, as described here. Mosquito transmission of larvae (choice E) is a means of transmission of the filarial nematodes, none of which are found in the United States and none of which would be found in vomitus. Skin penetration of larvae (choice F) is the mechanism of infection used by hookworms, threadworms, and schistosomes. None of these helminths would fit the description of the worm that was recovered in this case, since none of these is larger than 1 cm in length."

    "question": "A 16-year-old girl who is an exchange student from Panama is brought to the emergency department by her host family because of a high-grade fever and delirium She has had 2 episodes of similar symptoms during the past 2 years. A peripheral blood smear shows Schüffner dots in enlarged erythrocytes containing oval bodies. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Babesia microti",
      "B. Plasmodium falciparum",
      "C. Plasmodium malariae",
      "D. Plasmodium ovale",
      "E. Plasmodium vivax"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The description of Schüffner dots tells us this patient is infected with Plasmodium vivax or ovale malaria. Schüffner dots are morphologic changes that occur in infected host erythrocytes, are visible by light microscopy in Romanovsky-stained blood smears, and appear as multiple brick-red dots. Both P. vivax and P. ovale (choice D) are capable of causing relapse following recovery from the primary infection. Both organisms leave dormant forms in the liver, called hypnozoites. Of these two, however, only P. vivax occurs in the western hemisphere. P. falciparum and P. malariae (choices B and C) do not possess these dormant forms and thus are incapable of causing relapses, but if drug treatment of the erythrocytic stages is inadequate the symptoms can 'recrudesce' due to renewed multiplication in the bloodstream. Relapses and recrudescences look the same symptomatically, because once parasites begin multiplying again in the bloodstream, the cyclic fevers return. Babesia microti (choice A) causes malaria-like symptoms and is transmitted by the same tick that spreads Lyme disease. It does not occur in Panama."

Qualitative analysis of stool shows few leukocytes, trace mucus, and no blood. The causal agent produces a toxin with a mechanism of action that is closest to the mechanism of action of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus",
      "B. Diphtheria toxin",
      "C. Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
      "D. Labile toxin of Escherichia coli",
      "E. Pertussis toxin",
      "F. Verotoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae. The voluminous 'rice-water' stools described in the question result from the action of the cholera enterotoxin. Cholera enterotoxin acts by activating adenylate cyclase by ADP ribosylation of a GTP-binding protein in small intestinal crypt cells, turning on massive secretion of isotonic fluid. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli produce a toxin very similar to cholera toxin, the heat-labile toxin. The alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus (choice A) is a pore-forming toxin that punches holes in cellular membranes. Diphtheria toxin (choice B) acts by ribosylating eukaryotic elongation factor-2 and thereby inhibiting eukaryotic protein synthesis. Its binding component targets heart, nerve, and epithelial cells. Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (choice C) acts very similarly to the diphtheria toxin, inhibiting elongation factor-2, but targeting liver cells. Pertussis toxin (choice E) causes edema by ADP-ribosylating Gi, the inhibitory subunit of G protein, thus increasing cyclic AMP. Verotoxin (choice F) is produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and acts in a mechanism similar to that of the Shiga toxin, shutting down eukaryotic protein synthesis by clipping the 60S ribosomal subunit."

Gram stain of the shunt exudate shows gram-positive cocci that are catalase-positive and coagulase-negative. Which of the following is the most important pathogenic property of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Biofilm production",
      "B. Endotoxin production",
      "C. Intracellular habitat",
      "D. Novobiocin resistance",
      "E. Superantigen action"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common cause of infections involving catheters and prosthetic devices is Staphylococcus epidermidis. Materials left in the body for prolonged periods of time are almost always coated with Teflon™, which is so slippery that most organisms cannot adhere and cause infections there. S. epidermidis is capable of initiating infection even on Teflon-coated surfaces because it produces a biofilm that alters the surface tension of liquids around itself. Endotoxin production (choice B) is not an attribute of S. epidermidis. Endotoxin, or lipopolysaccharide is a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. S. epidermidis is a gram-positive organism. Intracellular habitat (choice C) is not an attribute of S. epidermidis. Staphylococci are extracellular bacteria. Novobiocin resistance (choice D) is exhibited by S. saprophyticus but not S. epidermidis, and it is a diagnostic aid, not a pathogenicity factor. Superantigen action (choice E) is expressed by the exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but it does not contribute to the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis."

When he is brought to the emergency department three days later, he has more than 10 bowel movements per day, and mucus, blood and pus are seen in the stool. He has developed weight loss and severe dehydration. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacillus anthracis",
      "B. Salmonella enterica subsp. typhi",
      "C. Shigella sonnei",
      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Yersinia pestis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The child has shigellosis (bacillary dysentery), which is an acute infection of the bowel that can be caused by a variety of Shigella organisms, including S. flexneri, S. sonnei (the most common isolate in the United States), S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae. The organism is spread via the fecal-oral route by contaminated food or inanimate objects; spread in contaminated water is unusual. Epidemics commonly occur in crowded populations with poor sanitation. Mini-epidemics have occurred in the daycare setting. The presentation given here is typical; adults may have a slower presentation. Diagnosis is important because untreated children may die (of dehydration and circulatory collapse) in the first 12 days. Fluid replacement is the most critical aspect of therapy and may require IV fluids in severe cases. The condition resolves spontaneously; use of antibiotics (TMP-SMX) may shorten duration. Bacillus anthracis (choice A) causes anthrax, which can produce skin infection and pneumonia. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi (choice B) causes typhoid fever, which differs from shigellosis because it is an enteric fever with more prominent systemic symptoms. Vibrio cholerae (choice D) causes cholera, with characteristic 'rice-water stool' diarrhea. Yersinia pestis (choice E) causes plague, with prominent lymph node and lung involvement."

      "B. A gram-positive, aerobic, spore-forming rod",
      "C. A gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming rod",

      "E. A gram-positive, coagulase-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This is a case of ecthyma gangrenosum, the hallmark lesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. It is a common nosocomial infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, or severe burns. P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-positive, aerobic (a nonfermenter), and catalase-positive. It is a prodigious producer of a capsule (slime layer) and is also distinguished by its production of a blue-green pigment and a grapelike odor. Bacillus is a gram-positive aerobic, spore-forming rod (choice B). Superficially, the skin lesion of anthrax (the anthrax eschar) might resemble the lesion caused by Pseudomonas but would not be a common finding in burn patients and indeed is quite rare in the United States. Clostridium is an anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive rod (choice C). Clostridium would not be a common pathogen in burn patients and would not cause such a lesion. A gram-positive, coagulase-negative coccus (choice D) could be Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus or any of the members of the genus Streptococcus. None of these agents would be likely to produce a lesion such as the one shown. Staph. epidermidis is a member of the normal skin flora and is best known for its ability to colonize intravenous catheters and the endocardium via its production of a biofilm. Staph. saprophyticus is best known as an agent of urinary tract infection in young, sexually active women, and the streptococci cause a wide variety of diseases, such as pharyngitis, meningitis, cellulitis, and endocarditis. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive coagulase-positive coccus (choice E). It is a member of the normal skin flora and causes abscesses, furuncles and boils, but not the lesion shown in the image here."

Which of the following is most likely responsible for the skin rash?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Hyaluronic acid capsule",
      "D. M protein",
      "E. Pyrogenic exotoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The rash described is that of scarlet fever, which can be a complication of streptococcal sore throat (as in this question) or streptococcal wound infection. In past centuries, scarlet fever was a major childhood disease that often caused death, but it has become much less common (possibly as a result of early antibiotic therapy) and is now only a rare cause of death. The fever and rash in this disease are due to the pyrogenic exotoxin, which is phage-encoded. The alpha toxins (choice A) of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are cytolysins. The alpha toxin of S. aureus is a pore former, and that of C. perfringens is a lecithinase. Endotoxin (choice B) is found in gram-negative organisms. Endotoxin directly activates macrophages to overproduce IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and causes gram-negative shock. Hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein (choices C and D) are both found in Streptococcus pyogenes, but are not responsible for the fever and rash seen in the present case. The hyaluronic acid capsule is non-immunogenic and makes it difficult for the immune system to recognize the infection. M protein is an anti-phagocytic surface protein."

      "C. Ephedrine",
      "D. Phenelzine",
      "E. Succinylcholine"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Botulism is caused by a protein toxin produced by the gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin type A is also available commercially as the compound OnabotulinumtoxinA. Botulinum toxin selectively cleaves the docking proteins for acetylcholine (ACh) exocytosis. As a result, there is decreased ACh transmission in all parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions and decreased sympathetic cholinergic transmission in sweat glands and neuromuscular junctions. Mydriasis is a result of decreased ACh activity on muscarinic receptors in parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions. Skeletal muscle weakness results from decreased ACh stimulation of nicotinic receptors in neuromuscular junctions. Skeletal muscle weakness is the differentiating feature between anticholinergic agents (i.e., atropine) and botulinum toxin. Serious adverse effects of botulinum toxin type A include respiratory compromise, development or worsening of acute angle-closure glaucoma, brachial plexopathy, dysphonia, muscle weakness, and anticholinergic side effects. Atropine (choice A), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, causes tachycardia, mydriasis, and elevated body temperature but does not cause muscle weakness. Ephedrine (choice C) is an indirect sympathomimetic and causes tachycardia, mydriasis, and possibly elevated body temperature from increased metabolic rate. It would not cause diffuse muscle weakness, however. Phenelzine (choice D), an MAO inhibitor, would also enhance the sympathetic system but with no effects on skeletal muscle. Succinylcholine (choice E), a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, causes muscle weakness but none of the other symptoms."

The other major cause of impetigo is Staphylococcus aureus and these two genera are distinguished on the basis of the catalase test. Staphylococcus is catalase-positive and Streptococcus is catalase-negative. The CAMP test (choice A) is the test used to distinguish the group B streptococci from other streptococci. It would not be useful here. The ELEK test (choice C) is the immunodiffusion test used to identify toxin-producing strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Although now rare in the United States due to vaccination programs, diphtheria is a serious disease with fatality rates between 5 and 10% in adults. The disease is an upper respiratory tract infection characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent pseudomembrane on the tonsil, pharynx, and/or nose. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a facultatively anaerobic gram-positive bacterium. Diphtheria toxin inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) in eukaryotic cells via ADP-ribosylation. The inactivation of eEF-2 inhibits cell protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. This directly affects translation elongation. Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin primarily targets the heart, nerves, and epithelium. Transcription initiation (choice A) and elongation (choice B) may be affected by drugs that target RNA polymerase, such as rifampin. These drugs are mainly used for mycobacteria. Transcription termination (choice C) is usually determined by chromatin structure, such as pin-loops. It is not generally easily targeted for inhibition by toxins or drugs.

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that produces blue-green pigments. It can easily be distinguished from the family Enterobacteriaceae because Pseudomonas is oxidase-positive. It is an opportunistic pathogen that has an increased chance of causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients who have indwelling catheters or who are on antibiotics. Pseudomonas is an agent of hot-tub folliculitis in normal patients using contaminated spas, and causes infections in burn patients and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. Esophagitis in AIDS patients (choice A) can be caused by Candida albicans. This is a yeast that can cause urinary tract infections in poorly controlled diabetics because glucose in the urine enhances its growth. Neonatal septicemia (choice C) is most frequently caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes. Of these, S. agalactiae is a gram-positive coccus and L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod; and although E. coli is a gram-negative rod, it is oxidase-negative and lactose-fermenting. E. coli is the most common cause of UTI overall. Pneumonia in AIDS patients (choice D) is caused by a variety of organisms, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis and Pneumocystis jiroveci. None of these is a gram-negative bacillus. Staghorn calculi in the urinary tract (choice E) are formed during infections with urease-positive organisms such as Proteus and Ureaplasma. Proteus is a gram-negative rod but is oxidase-negative, and Ureaplasma is a cell wall-less prokaryote related to Mycoplasma that would not stain at all with Gram stain."

    "question": "A 55-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intense, burning pain upon urination. Treatment with ampicillin is begun. One week later, she returns to the physician because of fever and flank pain. Her temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 90/30 mm Hg Blood cultures grow gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacilli. Which of the following virulence factors is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

      "A. Common core polysaccharide",
      "B. Lecithinase",
      "C. Lipid A",
      "D. O-specific polysaccharide",
      "E. Peptidoglycan"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Septic shock is a feared, potentially fatal complication of systemic infection with a wide variety of gram-negative organisms. The primary toxic agent is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Further, it has been established that the most toxic part of the LPS is lipid A. The pathophysiologic effects of LPS are related to triggering the release of potent cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor) from macrophages and activation of coagulation cascades. Common core polysaccharide (choice A) is a portion of the LPS that is the same in all gram-negative bacteria. The polysaccharide component of LPS is the immunogenic component. It is not the most important factor in pathogenesis. Lecithinase (choice B) is an enzyme produced by Clostridium perfringens that damages cell membranes. O-specific polysaccharide (choice D) is a portion of the LPS that induces specific immunity. Peptidoglycan (choice E) is found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and can be indirectly linked to LPS."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient became symptomatic with prolonged diarrhea, which is common in AIDS patients. All of the agents on the list are common causes of diarrhea in AIDS, but the only one that would produce acid-fast oocysts of this size in the stool is Cryptosporidium. Adenovirus (choice A) is a viral cause of diarrhea in AIDS. Viruses are minute in size compared to bacteria and eukaryotes, and would not be visible by standard microscopy of the stool. Listeria (choice C) is a gram-positive bacterium. Most bacteria measure less than 2 microns in size. Mycobacterium avium complex (choice D) commonly presents in AIDS patients with diarrhea, fever, and wasting. Although the organism is acid-fast, it is a bacterium that is intracellular, and as such its size is much smaller than that of a eukaryote. Salmonella (choice E) is a common cause of diarrhea in AIDS, but it is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacterium that would be about 2 μm in diameter."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This child has neonatal infection with Escherichia coli. The most important pathogenic attribute of the strains that cause neonatal disease is the K1 capsule that prevents phagocytosis. Most of the strains that cause this have the K1 serotype. E. coli is the most common gram-negative rod that infects children from maternal contamination as they pass through the birth canal. Beta hemolysis (choice A) is an attribute of some strains of urotropic E. coli but is not a major factor in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Biofilm production (choice B) is an attribute of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and enteroaggregative E. coli, but is not believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Exotoxin production (choice C) is involved in enterotoxigenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli pathogenesis, but is not believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Motility (choice E) is an important pathogenic mechanism among the agents of urinary tract infection because it gives them the ability to enter the bladder against the flow of urine. It is not believed to be important in the pathogenesis of neonatal disease caused by E. coli."

      "D. Dog bite",
      "E. Endogenous flora"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has pseudoappendicitis, and Yersinia enterocolitica is the pathogen that produces this clinical syndrome. Yersinia is transmitted to patients via the oral route, most commonly from contaminated milk, and occasionally, from blood transfusion. Y. enterocolitica is associated with cooler climates since it grows well at less than body temperature. Arthropod vectors (choice A) are not involved in transmission of Y. enterocolitica. Arthropods such as ticks transmit tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. Insects such as mosquitoes transmit viral encephalitides and malaria. Contaminated ground beef (choice B) is involved in the transmission of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), but is not a common source of infection with Y. enterocolitica. Dog bite (choice D) is not involved in the transmission of Y. enterocolitica. Dogs may transmit rabies, Capnocytophaga or Pasteurella. Endogenous transmission (choice E) is important in the formation of intestinal abscesses by anaerobic normal flora organisms, but is not believed to be involved with Y. enterocolitica transmission."

    "question": "A 12-year-old boy has a productive cough characterized by large volumes of foul-smelling sputum. He has a history of pancreatic insufficiency and steatorrhea. Cultures of the sputum grow colorless, oxidase-positive colonies with a fruity aroma on blood agar Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the exotoxin produced by the causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Activation of macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines",
      "B. Block release of acetylcholine",
      "C. Block release of GABA and glycine",
      "D. Increasing levels of cAMP",
      "E. Inhibition of protein synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This boy is displaying the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis with bronchiectasis (accounting for the foul-smelling sputum) and pancreatic insufficiency producing steatorrhea. However, the question directly relates to the infectious agent causing the pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an oxidase-positive bacterium with a fruity aroma. Pseudomonas produces blue-green pigments that act as siderophores when grown in an iron-limited environment, but are often colorless on blood agar. P. aeruginosa is a strictly aerobic, gram-negative rod that produces an exotoxin (exotoxin A) that ADP-ribosylates, and therefore inhibits, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2), which is a G protein involved in the eukaryotic translation of proteins. Activation of macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines (choice A) is the mechanism by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes damage. This is an endotoxin and is not to be confused with an exotoxin. Blocking release of acetylcholine (choice B) is specific for Clostridium botulinum which produces a neurotoxin that causes a flaccid paralysis. Blocking release of GABA and glycine (choice C) is specific for Clostridium tetani which produces a neurotoxin that causes a spastic paralysis. Increasing levels of cAMP (choice D) refers to the toxins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Vibrio cholerae, Bordetella pertussis and Bacillus anthracis. These exotoxins each increase cellular fluid loss, leading to the causation of edema or diarrhea."

    "options": [
      "A. Hydrops fetalis",
      "B. Necrotizing encephalitis",
      "C. Patent ductus arteriosus",
      "D. Pulmonary stenosis",
      "E. Retinochoroiditis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Toxoplasma gondii is capable of crossing the placenta and causing harmful fetal infection only during an acute maternal infection. During this period, rapidly dividing forms called tachyzoites can be spread via the bloodstream and thus cross the placenta. As soon as the maternal immune response is initiated, parasitemia ceases and the parasite can no longer enter the fetus. In a patient such as this one, occupational exposure to cats (the definitive host of the parasite) might be assumed. In the general U.S. population, however, it is more common to acquire the infection from poorly cooked pork. When the organism infects the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy there is little risk of fetal infection, but infections that do occur often involve serious damage to the central nervous system, e.g. necrotizing encephalitis, or disseminated disease. When the organism infects the mother in later trimesters the fetus has a greater likelihood of infection, but most of those infections will be asymptomatic. Hydrops fetalis (choice A) is a common consequence of fetal infection with the B19 virus, which infects immature erythrocytes. It may occur following in utero infection with Toxoplasma but it is not the most common sequela. Patent ductus arteriosus (choice C) and pulmonary stenosis (choice D) are aspects of congenital rubella syndrome, caused when rubella virus crosses the placenta. Retinochoroiditis (choice E) is a consequence of infection of second- and third-trimester fetuses with Toxoplasma gondii. It may also occur 20 to 30 years after birth in children born with asymptomatic Toxoplasma infections."

      "E. Gram-positive bacillus",
      "F. Gram-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. The clinical presentation and lumbar puncture suggests meningitis. The presence of numerous neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests a bacterial pathogen. The most common cause of neonatal meningitis is Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a gram-positive coccus. Acid-fast bacillus (choice A) describes a bacterium in the genus Mycobacterium. These bacteria are not causes of neonatal meningitis. Double-stranded DNA virus with nuclear membrane envelope (choice B) describes a virus in the herpesvirus family. Herpesviruses may cause encephalitis in newborns but would not be a likely cause of meningitis in this age group. A gram-negative bacillus (choice C) describes Escherichia coli among many others. E. coli is the second most common cause of neonatal meningitis. Gram-negative diplococcus (choice D) describes the genera Neisseria, Moraxella and Veillonella. Of these, Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis, but usually in adolescents and young adults. It would not be the most common cause of a neonatal presentation such as this one. Gram-positive bacillus (choice E) describes Listeria monocytogenes among others. Listeria is the third most common cause of neonatal meningitis in the United States."

Infection with which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cryptosporidium parvum",
      "B. Dientamoeba fragilis",
      "C. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "D. Giardia lamblia",
      "E. Isospora belli"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Entamoeba histolytica may produce asymptomatic infection or more severe disease characterized by mucosal ulcerations and submucosal spread causing abdominal distress and bloody stools. Stools may show either trophozoite forms or the typical spherical cysts. E. histolytica cysts characteristically are spherical in shape, are 10-20 μm in diameter and have granular cytoplasm containing up to four nuclei. Cryptosporidium parvum (choice A) infections occur in the immunocompromised population and may cause severe diarrhea. The organism presents as minute (2-5 μm) intracellular spheres or arc-shaped merozoites under normal mucosa, and can be difficult to see by light microscopy. Cysts in the stool are too small (4-5 μm) to be confused with Entamoeba. Dientamoeba fragilis (choice B) is an intestinal ameba that also may produce an infectious diarrhea. It does not have a cyst form, and only the trophozoite forms are seen in stools. Giardia lamblia (choice D) is a flagellate protozoan that infects the stomach and small intestine when contaminated water is ingested. Diagnosis is usually made by examining duodenal contents; however, the stools may contain the oval or elliptical cysts, which are thick-walled and measure 8-14 μm in diameter. Spherical cysts are not seen in Giardia infection, and giardial diarrheas are not bloody. Isospora belli (choice E) produces self-limited intestinal infections, mostly in the tropics, in which fever and diarrhea may last weeks to months. The stool-borne cysts are much larger than Entamoeba (30 by 15 μm), are asymmetrical, and are typically almond-shaped."

    "options": [
      "A. Multiple serotypes",
      "B. Negative-sense genome",
      "C. Spread by respiratory droplets",
      "D. Syncytia formation",
      "E. Viral hemagglutinin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The disease is mumps, caused by a paramyxovirus. In children, mumps causes a transient inflammation of the parotid glands, and less commonly, of the testes, pancreas, or central nervous system. Mumps tends to be a more severe disease in adults than in children. Mumps in adults involves the testes (causing orchitis) and pancreas with some frequency. The paramyxoviruses are negative-sense RNA viruses that spread from cell to cell by syncytia formation. This protects them from exposure to substances that exist extracellularly (such as antibodies) and makes cell-mediated immunity an absolutely essential event for recovery and cure. This is why the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine must be live-attenuated, to stimulate strong cell-mediated immunity. Multiple serotypes (choice A) of medical importance do not exist in mumps virus. The vaccine contains a single serotype. A negative-sense genome (choice B) is possessed by the Paramyxoviridae, but this attribute is not associated with the lack of efficacy of antibodies. The negative-sense genome causes these viruses to require a virion-associated polymerase for infectivity. It is true that the mumps virus is spread by respiratory droplets (choice C) - but this attribute does not have a relationship to making antibodies ineffective in cure. Many viruses that are spread by respiratory droplets can be prevented by an adequate IgA or IgG antibody response. Viral hemagglutinin (choice E) in the case of mumps virus exists in a complex with the neuraminidase molecule and thus is not found alone on the surface of the virion. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase complex is responsible for the attachment to cells via sialic acid residues and the release from the cell following the clipping off of sialic acid residues. Many viruses that have hemagglutinin-neuraminidase complexes on the surface of their membrane can be neutralized by antibodies, so this attribute does not contribute to the need for a cell-mediated immune response."

Out of 100 bacterial cultures subsequently tested, two cultures showed ampicillin resistance but failed to show viral cytolysis. Which of the following processes of DNA transfer most likely occurred in these two cultures?",
    "options": [
      "A. F+ to F- conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Hfr to F- conjugation",
      "D. Homologous recombination",
      "E. Site-specific recombination",
      "F. Specialized transduction",
      "G. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The mechanism involving transfer of bacterial DNA from cell to cell using a lytic phage as a vector is called generalized transduction. It occurs when bacterial DNA is accidentally captured into a phage head during the lytic virus life cycle and then transferred to another bacterial cell. If the recipient cell is capable of homologous recombination of the newly donated DNA, then that cell can acquire new genetic traits that will persist stably in its genome. F+ to F- conjugation (choice A) involves the transfer of a plasmid from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. The experimental situation described here does not involve two cells exchanging DNA, but rather a virus picking up DNA from one cell and transferring it to another. Hfr to F- conjugation (choice C) involves the transfer of chromosomal DNA from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. The experimental situation described here does not involve two cells exchanging DNA. Homologous recombination (choice D) is a process by which linear DNA that has been delivered into a new cell can be successfully recombined into the chromosome and stabilized for the next generation. It is not a mechanism of transfer of bacterial DNA, but rather a mechanism which allows for the protection of DNA transferred into another cell. Although homologous recombination is a necessary final step in all mechanisms of transfer of bacterial DNA with the exception of the F+ to F- cross, it is not the means by which a virus transfers DNA from cell to cell. Site-specific recombination (choice E) is a process by which circles of DNA may become integrated together. It occurs during the lysogenic viral life cycle, when transposons move within bacterial cells, and during the formation of the Hfr chromosome when a conjugative plasmid inserts itself into the bacterial genome. It is not a mechanism of transfer of DNA from cell to another. Specialized transduction (choice F) is the mechanism by which lysogenic (temperate) phages transfer DNA from one bacterium to another as an accident of the lysogenic viral life cycle. Viruses establish lysogeny by inserting their DNA into the bacterial chromosome by site-specific recombination. Later, if an error of excision occurs during induction, bacterial genes adjacent to the insertion site may be transferred. Since the virus that was added to cultures in this question was a lytic virus, it is not capable of performing this type of transduction. Transformation (choice G) is the process by which free bacterial DNA can be picked up by competent bacteria, imported, and integrated into the chromosome with homologous recombination. No viruses are involved in transformation."

      "B. Clostridium perfringens",
      "C. Francisella tularensis",
      "D. Listeria monocytogenes",
      "E. Yersinia pestis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Any previously healthy person in the Southwestern United States who develops septic shock or severe pulmonary disease should be evaluated for plague. Plague is not an extinct disease but is still encountered in sporadic cases in various places in the world, including Asia, Africa, parts of Europe, and the U.S. Southwest. The causative organism is Yersinia pestis which is endemic in many wild-animal populations and can be transmitted to humans either by direct contact or by flea bite. Human plague may take many forms, including pestis minor (mild lymphadenopathy), bubonic plague (prominent hemorrhagic lymphadenopathy), pneumonic plague (as in this patient), and septicemic plague. The primary pneumonic form typically presents as described. Antibiotics are most effective if given within the first 24 hours, which can be problematic if medical staff does not suspect the disease. Since plague is rare in the United States, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required to make a rapid diagnosis and to institute timely treatment. If the diagnosis is missed, the mortality rate is quite high. Brucella abortus (choice A) causes brucellosis characterized by undulating fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Brucellosis occurs rarely in the United States, mainly in slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians and farmers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) causes gangrene and gastroenteritis. Francisella tularensis (choice C) causes tularemia, which is associated with a spectrum of manifestations from an influenza-like syndrome to adenopathy with ulceration at the site of inoculation. In the United States it occurs most commonly in hunters in Arkansas and Missouri. Listeria monocytogenes (choice D) causes listeriosis. Infection during pregnancy may result in sepsis, abortion, or premature delivery. Infection in the neonate may produce meningitis. In immunocompromised adults, either meningitis or sepsis may occur."

      "D. Inactivation of complement",
      "E. Protein A"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The tests mentioned reveal a gram-positive coccus with the characteristics of Staphylococcus (gram-positive cocci in grapelike clusters). The organism is beta-hemolytic (breaks hemoglobin down to a colorless product) and catalase-positive (produces water and oxygen gas from the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide). Production of a fibrin clot in a tube of animal serum reveals that the organism is coagulase-positive. The only organism that fits all of these criteria is Staphylococcus aureus. Staph. aureus evades phagocytosis by producing protein A, which binds to the Fc component of IgG, thus preventing opsonization. Capsules (choice A) of bacteria and fungi are antiphagocytic but this is not the means used by S. aureus to evade phagocytosis. Key encapsulated organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans. Diffuse fimbriate layers (choice B) of gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes cause adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. They do not protect against phagocytosis. IgA proteases (choice C) are produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae. They do not protect against phagocytosis, although they do tend to prevent the bacteria that produce them from immediately being shed from the mucosal surfaces. Inactivation of complement (choice D) is a mechanism used by Strep. pneumoniae to protect itself against opsonization."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has cystitis caused by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Quinolones inhibit DNA synthesis, recombination, and repair by inhibiting DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV. The genes encoding resistance to quinolones are primarily chromosomally encoded and involve mutations in the structural genes for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase type IV. It also involves decreased drug uptake caused by mutations in genes that regulate membrane permeability. Another minor mechanism involved in quinolone resistance, which is encoded by plasmids, consists of the overexpression of a pumping mechanism that actively exports the drug. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone whose main mechanism of resistance is chromosomally mediated. Conjugative plasmids (choice B) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that are capable of mediating their own transfer from cell to cell via conjugation. Although they are a very common source of drug-resistance genes, they are not involved in the majority of the cases of resistance to quinolones. Episomes (choice C) are plasmids that have been integrated into the chromosome of the bacterial cell. Genes encoding quinolone resistance are not known to exist in episome form. Nonconjugative plasmids (choice D) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that do not contain the tra operon. They are not involved in quinolone resistance. Prophages (choice E) are temperate bacteriophages that have integrated their DNA into the chromosome of the bacterial cell. Although abnormal excision can cause bacteriophages of this type to transfer drug-resistance genes the prophage DNA, by itself does not include the drug-resistance genes."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman who recently emigrated from Africa develops thick, erythematous nodules on the ears and nose with significant associated sensory loss. The nodules have grown slowly over the course of many years. Biopsy of the lesions shows dermal granulomas with giant cells and a few acid-fast bacteria. Cultures on blood agar and Lowenstein-Jensen medium show no growth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cutaneous leishmaniasis",
      "B. Lepromatous leprosy",
      "C. Onchocerciasis",
      "D. Rhinoscleroma",
      "E. Smallpox",
      "F. Tuberculoid leprosy"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Mycobacterium leprae is endemic to parts of Africa, Asia, and South America. Tuberculoid leprosy is an indolent disease, typically affecting cooler parts of the body (such as the nose and ears) producing dermal granulomas with rare, acid-fast bacilli and damage to peripheral nerves. This is in marked contrast to lepromatous leprosy, which is progressive, invasive and generally characterized by the presence of numerous acid-fast bacteria in a histiocytic but nongranulomatous tissue response. M. leprae has not been successfully grown on artificial media. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (choice A) is due to Leishmania species that show a worldwide distribution. The infection is transmitted through a sandfly bite, and the skin lesion is typically ulcerated. Histology shows intracellular parasites within the dermis and epidermis. Granulomas are not formed. Lepromatous leprosy (choice B) is the form of disease when the wrong T-helper (TH) cell is activated. Because TH2 cells stimulate antibody production, they have no value against an intracellular pathogen, and the patient develops disfiguring disseminated disease. Onchocerciasis (choice C) or river blindness, is a roundworm infection transmitted by blackflies of Africa and South America. The microfilariae grow at the site of inoculation and cause an inflamed subcutaneous nodule. The organism is seen on tissue sections. Rhinoscleroma (choice D) is a destructive granulomatous infection of the nasopharynx and is caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. Gram-negative rods can be cultured from the lesions. Smallpox (choice E), the infection caused by the variola virus (a DNA poxvirus) produces malaise, headaches, and a macular/pustular rash involving the face and distal extremities. Smallpox has been eradicated through worldwide vaccination."

    "options": [
      "A. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "B. Colorado tick fever virus",
      "C. Francisella tularensis",
      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. West Nile virus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The combination of a 1-week incubation period and the intraerythrocytic parasites strongly suggests Babesia microti as the infecting organism. The clinical disease is called babesiosis. The infecting protozoan is related to Plasmodium and is transmitted by the bite of the Ixodes scapularis tick. Occasional cases have been transmitted by blood transfusions. Most patients are asymptomatic; symptomatic cases in reasonably healthy individuals have the features described in the question stem. Rare severe cases, which may be fatal, may develop in severely debilitated or asplenic individuals and can be accompanied by severe hemolysis (up to 30% of red blood cells may have the parasites) with subsequent hemoglobinuria, hemolysis, and renal failure. Ixodes ticks are potential vectors of Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi) and Anaplasma (formerly Ehrlichia) phagocytophila (the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis). Colorado tick fever virus (choice B), Francisella tularensis (choice C) and Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) are all transmitted by the Dermacentor tick, not the Ixodes tick. West Nile encephalitis virus (choice E) is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes."

    "question": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive muscular weakness and poor head control. The mother says that she feeds the boy a soy-based formula sweetened with honey. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is ingestion of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. A gram-positive vegetative bacillus",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Exotoxin",
      "D. Neurotoxin",
      "E. Spores"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This baby has infant botulism (floppy-baby syndrome), which is due to germination of Clostridium botulinum spores in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. This disorder is most common in children under the age of 6 months. Older children and adults do not appear to be vulnerable to this form of botulism, but are susceptible to botulism caused by ingestion of preformed toxin. Floppy-baby syndrome is acquired following the ingestion of spores of the organism. A gram-positive vegetative bacillus (choice A) describes C. botulinum, but it is not ingestion of the vegetative bacteria that causes this condition. Endotoxin (choice B), or lipopolysaccharide, is found on all gram-negative bacteria; and C. botulinum is a gram-positive rod. Exotoxin (choice C) could describe any secreted toxin, including neurotoxins, but again this infant's condition was not an intoxication and was not due to ingestion of any kind of toxin directly. A neurotoxin (choice D) describes tetanospasmin or botulinum toxin, which is produced by C. tetani or C. botulinum respectively. Tetanus toxin causes a rigid paralysis due to the inhibition of glycine and GABA at inhibitory synapses. The present case is one of infant botulism, which was not due to ingestion of a preformed toxin or an intoxication as is adult botulism."

      "B. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi",
      "C. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Yersinia enterocolitica"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Yersinia enterocolitica is an important cause of 'mini-epidemics' of pediatric diarrhea. Outbreaks are common in colder climates and the organism can be grown well at 4°C (39.2°F). Adults can also be affected, but less commonly than children. Some diarrheal cases are severe (and occasionally fatal) and may be complicated by severe dysentery, appendicitis, or chronic relapsing ileocolitis that may require antibiotics (quinolone, third-generation cephalosporin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) to shorten the course. Helicobacter pylori (choice A) is an important cause of gastritis and ulcers. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi (choice B) causes typhoid fever. It is not common in the United States, but symptoms of infection include fever, abdominal rash and splenomegaly. Diarrhea is not a consistent feature. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice C) usually causes respiratory infections rather than diarrhea. Vibrio cholerae (choice D) causes cholera. It is not a common cause of diarrhea in day-care centers in the United States but is normally associated with massive environmental doses of bacteria in contaminated water. Patients with cholera have severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."

Some have had blood-tinged stools and some have had profound abdominal cramping and fever. All the affected individuals attended a dinner party several days ago. An overnight stool culture at 42°C (107.6°F) grows microaerophilic, oxidase-positive, gram-negative curved rods with polar flagella. Which of the following is the most likely source of this infection?",

      "G. Rare red meat dishes",
      "H. Rice dishes",
      "I. Smoked fish",
      "J. Soft cheeses"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. This case history and culture characteristics describe a typical gastroenteritis due to Campylobacter jejuni, the most common bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. Contaminated poultry or poultry products are responsible for more than 60% of all infections. Carriers (choice A) are not known to occur with Campylobacter, and are best known with Salmonella typhi. Typhoid fever is an enteric fever that presents with fever, lymphadenopathy and constipation. Custard and potato-salad dishes (choice B) would be the most likely source if the agent was Staphylococcus aureus, but this would have had an onset of 2 hours, and a gram-positive coccus would have been the cause. Milk and cream (choice C) might contain Listeria or Mycobacterium bovis, but Listeria is a gram-positive rod and Mycobacterium is an acid-fast rod. Both may cause a minor gastroenteritis in healthy adults but would be unlikely to present with blood in the stool. Poorly canned green vegetables (choice D) are the usual source of Clostridium botulinum, which would cause a flaccid paralysis. Clostridium is a genus of gram-positive rods. Poorly washed salad greens (choice E) could be sources of infection with multiple agents such as Escherichia coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella or Shigella. The E. coli strains which cause non-bloody diarrhea are usually associated with travel out of the home country (traveler's diarrhea). E. coli is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-negative. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that does not occur commonly in the United States but instead requires travel to a tropical country, and Salmonella and Shigella would be more likely to cause frankly bloody stools. Both are gram-negative rods that are oxidase-negative. Rare red meat dishes (choice G) would be good sources for Escherichia coli or Trichinella spiralis. E. coli is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod and Trichinella is a nematode. The serotype of E. coli associated with rare meat dishes in the United States causes bloody diarrhea without leukocytes. Trichinosis causes myalgia, fever, eosinophilia, splinter hemorrhages and periorbital edema. Rice dishes (choice H) are most frequently incriminated in the transmission of Bacillus cereus, which has a 1-to-2-hour onset of vomiting followed by diarrhea. Bacillus is a genus of gram-positive rods. Smoked fish (choice I) is a common source of Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive spore-forming rod that would produce a flaccid paralysis. Soft cheeses (choice J) are a common source of Listeria monocytogenes, which is a gram-positive rod that causes mild gastroenteritis."

    "question": "A healthy 32-year-old primigravid woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal examination. She states that she emigrated from Southeast Asia and that three years ago, she had fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice joint pains, and generalized skin lesions that slowly disappeared. Which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered to investigate the patient's past illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibody",
      "B. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM antibody",
      "C. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)",
      "D. IgM antibody to HBcAg",
      "E. IgM antibody to HBsAg"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The clinical signs suggest that this woman had hepatitis B three years ago, and the fact that she is now feeling better also suggests that she recovered from this infection. Since she is pregnant, it is necessary to find out if she still has the agent in her liver (chronic hepatitis B infection) by performing a test for HBsAg. This test will be negative if she has completely recovered from the disease, but it will be positive if she is a chronic carrier. Ordering CMV IgG antibody (choice A) would be of no value because the clinical signs of the disease she had 3 years ago do not match those of CMV, and CMV does not produce chronic infections. Quantitation of HAV IgM antibody (choice B) would be useless, since HAV only causes acute infection. Measurement of IgM antibody to HBcAg (choice D) would be of no value at this time. This antibody is positive in acute hepatitis B, but would no longer be positive in this case. Examination of IgM antibody to HBsAg (choice E) would be of no value at this time. This antibody would be formed early during the recovery from acute hepatitis B, and would class-switch to IgG later on in the disease."

      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Enterotoxin",
      "D. Neurotoxin",
      "E. superantigen toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The disease described is gas gangrene, which is caused by the spore-forming anaerobe Clostridium perfringens and other closely related species. These very dangerous bacteria particularly like to grow in necrotic vascular tissue, and they produce a variety of destructive enzymes and toxins. The toxin produced by C. perfringens that is most strongly associated with myonecrosis is the alpha toxin, which is a lecithinase (phospholipase C) that lyses erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells. This toxin mediates massive hemolysis, increased vascular permeability and bleeding, hepatotoxicity, bradycardia, and hypotension. In the laboratory, the action of the lecithinase can be observed in Nagler's reaction, in which strains of C. perfringens will lyse the lecithin in egg-yolk agar. Endotoxin (choice B) is lipopolysaccharide and is not found on gram-positive organisms such as Clostridium. Enterotoxins (choice C) are produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including C. perfringens but the vignette is clearly specific for myonecrosis and not gastroenteritis. Neurotoxins (choice D) are produced by other members of the genera Clostridium (C. tetanus and C. botulinum), but not by C. perfringens. Superantigen toxin (choice E) is specific for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and the pyrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes. These exotoxins cause fever, petechial rash, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy."

    "options": [
      "A. It captures a nuclear membrane envelope",
      "B. It replicates in the cytoplasm",
      "C. It replicates in the nucleus",
      "D. It utilizes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase",
      "E. It utilizes reverse transcriptase"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The lesions are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum, a typically benign and self-limited condition caused by a poxvirus. The disease can be transmitted either sexually or through direct nonsexual contact. Patients with advanced HIV infection may develop a severe, generalized, and persistent eruption, often involving the face and upper body. Molluscum contagiosum virus is a poxvirus that reproduces in the cytoplasm and produces intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Capturing a nuclear membrane envelope (choice A) and replication in the nucleus (choice C) are characteristics of Herpesviridae. This family includes herpes simplex 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster, herpes 6 and herpes 8. None of these agents cause umbilicated warts, although rashes may occur. Herpes simplex causes vesicular lesions on the mucosae and varicella causes an asynchronous pruritic rash (chickenpox) or a unilateral vesicular rash that follows a dermatome (shingles). Utilization of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (choice D) is characteristic of all RNA viruses. Utilization of reverse transcriptase (choice E) is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus. Reverse transcriptase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase."

    "options": [
      "A. Crohn disease",

      "C. Disseminated gonococcal infection",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"

The condition is characterized by itching and soreness, pain on intercourse, finding of pseudohyphae in vaginal secretions, and absence of a particular odor. Predisposing factors include a high vaginal pH, diabetes, and use of antibiotics. The increased vulnerability in diabetes may reflect increased glucose concentrations in vaginal secretions and relative immunosuppression. Crohn disease (choice A) can predispose for fistulas involving the vagina, rather than vulvovaginitis. Dissemination of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (choice C) can cause septic arthritis. The discharge of gonorrhea is leukorrheic and will contain neutrophils full of gram-negative diplococci. Neither rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) nor systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) is specifically associated with Candida vulvovaginitis."

      "B. Poultry",
      "C. Rice",
      "D. Salad greens",
      "E. Vacuum-packed fish"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This is a typical presentation of botulism, which is caused by the preformed toxin of Clostridium botulinum. Patients develop a progressive flaccid paralysis that can lead to death if the respiratory system is not adequately supported. Mentation is intact in these patients, and they do not exhibit sensory changes except for those related to failure of extraocular and intraocular muscles (e.g., diplopia, cycloplegia). The most common food sources implicated in botulism are canned alkaline vegetables and preserved fish. Since the genus Clostridium is anaerobic, materials packaged in the absence of oxygen will allow germination of the spores and the production of the toxin. Treatment is supportive. An antitoxin is available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) via state Health Departments, but may not be obtained early enough to be helpful. Most patients recover from food-borne botulism without any sequelae. Ground beef (choice A) is often implicated in transmission of Escherichia coli but is not involved in adult botulism. Poultry (choice B) is a common source of food poisoning caused by Campylobacter and Salmonella but is not a source of adult botulism. Rice (choice C) is a food often implicated in Bacillus cereus food poisoning, but not in adult botulism.

      "D. Rubeola",
      "E. Varicella zoster virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, or Fifth disease. Adults typically do not get the facial rash ('slapped cheek') typical of children, but have arthralgias and arthritis. The symmetrical distribution of involved joints is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis. The onset in adults is typically 3 to 4 weeks after exposure. Parvovirus infections may persist in immunosuppressed patients, resulting in red blood cell aplasia. B19 virus can cross the placenta and cause hydrops fetalis because it infects erythroid precursors, and has been linked to the aplastic crises of sickle cell anemia. Human herpesvirus type 6 (choice A) is the causative agent of roseola infantum, which is a common childhood illness that causes an extremely high fever; the fever subsides and then the child develops a lacy body rash. Rubella (choice C) is the German measles, which is sometimes called the three-day measles. Although the rash looks similar to that of rubeola (measles) the rubella rash is less intense than that of rubeola. Rubella is best known for its ability to cross the placenta and cause serious congenital defects. Rubeola (choice D) is the measles, which is characterized by the 3 C's (cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis) and photophobia, Koplik spots, and a maculopapular rash that begins below the ears and eventually spreads downward and also covers the face.

      "C. Respiratory droplets",
      "D. Sexual transmission",
      "E. Transplacental transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The lesions shown are ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, and in an AIDS patient, this is extremely suggestive of infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasmosis presents with seizures in 15-25% of cases. Because 70-80% of the world's population is seropositive, reactivational disease in the immunocompromised is extremely common. The disease is most commonly spread in the United States by ingestion of cysts from undercooked pork, but it can also be spread transplacentally or from cat feces. Tachyzoites develop intracellularly in phagocytic cells and then spread to the brain, muscle, and other tissues, where they encyst and multiply. Primary central nervous system lymphoma in AIDS patients can present clinically in nearly the same manner as toxoplasmosis, but the course is usually much more indolent. Fecal-oral contamination (choice B) is not the most common means of acquiring toxoplasmosis in the United States. Although cats serve as the necessary definitive host, and contamination with cat feces can cause infection, it is not the most common source in this country. Respiratory droplets (choice C) are not known to be a means of infection with T. gondii. Sexual transmission (choice D) is not known to occur in toxoplasmosis. Transplacental transmission (choice E) occurs with Toxoplasma in 2 to 6 out of every 1,000 live births.

      "C. Extracellular spirochetes",
      "D. Greatly enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with glassy amphophilic viral inclusions",
      "E. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient most likely has herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. HSV-1 is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis in the United States, accounting for approximately 10% to 20% of the 20,000 viral encephalitis cases that occur annually. Viral encephalitis is characterized by elevated lymphocytes and erythrocytes in the CSF. HSV-1 encephalitis has a propensity for the temporal lobes of the brain. Other types of viral encephalitis typically affect older patients, occur in the summer months (because of mosquito transmission), and have no particular association to regions of the brain. Cowdry type A inclusions are intranuclear viral inclusion bodies that may be found in both neurons and glia and are characteristic of herpes simplex infection. The presence of both distinct nuclear and ill-defined cytoplasmic inclusions (choice A) specifically suggests cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV infection of the brain characteristically occurs in severely immunosuppressed patients, in whom it tends to localize to the paraventricular subependymal regions of the brain. Extracellular spirochetes (choice C) can sometimes be demonstrated in patients with neuroborreliosis, the brain infection seen in Lyme disease, and in neurosyphilis. Neuroborreliosis can cause aseptic meningitis, facial nerve palsies, and encephalopathy. Neurosyphilis can occur in three basic forms: meningovascular syphilis (involving the base of the brain), general paresis (involving the frontal lobe and other areas of the neocortex), and tabes dorsalis (involving the dorsal roots and spinal cord). Greatly enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with glassy amorphic viral inclusions (choice D) are a feature of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This viral encephalitis usually occurs in immunosuppressed patients and is caused by the JC polyomavirus. PML is characterized by demyelination because it preferentially infects oligodendroglia. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells (choice E) are characteristic of chronic HIV encephalitis, which tends to involve in particular the subcortical white matter, diencephalon, and brainstem."

      "D. An intracellular parasitic protozoan",
      "E. An intracellular yeast"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Patients with AIDS are prone to a variety of opportunistic infections, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia represents one of the most common initial presentations. This organism is a ubiquitous atypical fungus that may cause a life-threatening acute interstitial pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. P. jiroveci appears as a cystlike organism with a characteristic cup shape that has been likened to a 'crushed tennis ball'. Methenamine silver staining allows its identification in bronchoalveolar lavage. A frothy exudate filling the alveolar cavities is a characteristic finding in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia. Pneumocystis has been classified as a fungus by ribosomal RNA analysis, but it is an unusual member of the group. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus (choice A) describes the genus Staphylococcus. Staphylococcus does not silver-stain and is not a common cause of dyspnea in AIDS patients. An encapsulated monomorphic fungus (choice B) describes the genus Cryptococcus. This genus causes dangerous meningitis in the immunocompromised person, but is not a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS. An intracellular parasitic protozoan (choice D) describes Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasma may cause encephalitis in AIDS patients, but it would not be expected to cause pneumonia. An intracellular yeast (choice E) describes Histoplasma capsulatum. This agent causes acute and chronic pulmonary disease in AIDS patients, but would not produce methenamine silver-staining cysts."

In a bacterial culture, cell wall synthesis will occur at a maximal rate during the period of exponential growth, which is marked on the graph by the letter C. The lag phase (choice A) is the initial phase of a bacterial culture during which there is no increase in cell number. Cells in a culture at this stage are activating enzymes necessary for metabolism, but are not undergoing cell wall synthesis. Choice B indicates the initial phase of bacterial multiplication, when cell division has not yet reached a maximum. Although cell wall synthesis would indeed make such cells sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics, it is not the period of maximum sensitivity. Choice D indicates the phase of the bacterial growth curve when toxic metabolic products begin to accumulate and nutrient levels begin to be insufficient to support continued growth. New cell wall synthesis would begin to fall at this point. The stationary phase (choice E) is a period of the bacterial growth curve when the number of bacteria dividing in the culture equals the number of cells dying. This would not be a period of intense cell wall synthesis. The decline (choice F) and death (choice G) phases of the bacterial growth curve are periods when bacteria are dying more rapidly than they are dividing. Cell wall synthesis would be minimal."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right upper quadrant pain and a fever. He also has had a 2-month history of chronic diarrhea and bloody stools. Physical examination shows a large, tender liver. Ultrasound shows an ovoid, hypoechoic lesion near the liver capsule. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the liver will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Image A (Toxoplasma gondii)",
      "B. Image B (Fasciola hepatica)",
      "C. Image C (Clonorchis sinensis ovum)",
      "D. Image D (Entamoeba histolytica trophozoite)",
      "E. Image E (Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts)"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal amebic parasite that either can cause relatively mild diarrhea or can behave more aggressively, causing dysentery (bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain and dehydration), peritonitis, or liver abscess formation (such as this patient has). Treatment is generally administered as soon as the diagnosis is made. Metronidazole is the drug of choice for the treatment of this infection due to its excellent tissue penetration. Metronidazole is effective for both invasive and luminal disease. However, upon successful completion of metronidazole therapy, a 'luminal agent' such as paromomycin or iodoquinol is administered to completely eradicate any remaining gastrointestinal tract infection and prevent an infection relapse. The trophozoite of E. histolytica, which is shown in the image, is identified by the distinctive 'cart-wheel' distribution of chromatin in the nucleus and the evidence of ingested red blood cells. Toxoplasma gondii (choice A) is a cause of encephalitis in the immunocompromised, and birth defects in children infected transplacentally, but is not a common cause of liver abscess or bloody diarrhea. The large tissue cyst shown here would be characteristic of an early active stage of disease or reactivation disease in the immunocompromised. Fasciola hepatica (choice B) is the sheep liver fluke. It can cause bile duct obstruction in infected humans but would not be a likely cause of bloody diarrhea or of liver abscess. It is very rare in the United States. The adult fluke, shown here, is identified by the prominent 'shoulders' on the anterior end. Clonorchis sinensis (choice C) is the Chinese liver fluke. It causes hepatitis and cholangitis in Chinese populations, but not bloody diarrhea or liver abscess. The ovum, which is shown here, is identified by the prominent opercular ridge on the far right of this image. Cryptosporidium parvum (choice E) is a protozoan parasite related to T. gondii. In humans it can cause chronic bloody diarrhea in the immunocompromised, but it is not a cause of liver abscess. The image shows a Giemsa stain of the oocysts that would be found in the stool. Diagnosis of this condition is normally made by acid-fast staining of the stool."

Physical examination shows a tender pinna, swelling and erythema of the external auditory canal, as well as a purulent discharge. The tympanic membrane cannot be visualized A CT scan of the head shows temporal bone erosions and new bone formation. Culture of the discharge will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative bacillus requiring factors X and V",
      "B. Gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting bacillus",
      "C. Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus that produces blue-green pigments",
      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic coccus",
      "E. Gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has malignant external otitis, which is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of self-limited external otitis. It may, however, penetrate the epithelium and invade the underlying soft tissue, cartilage and bone, thus leading to osteomyelitis and cranial nerve palsies. The presenting symptoms include ear pain and discharge, hearing loss, and facial nerve paralysis. Abnormalities of the external ear canal are present. A CT scan may reveal bony erosions and soft-tissue swelling. Cultures will isolate the organism. Treatment includes antibiotics and surgical debridement. Malignant external otitis is most common in elderly diabetic patients. Pseudomonas is a genus of gram-negative bacilli that are oxidase-positive, aerobic, and produce blue-green pigments. Other diseases caused by Pseudomonas include septicemia, wound or burn infections, urinary tract infections in catheterized patients, and life-threatening pneumonias in cystic fibrosis patients. A gram-negative bacillus requiring factors X and V (choice A) describes the genus Haemophilus. This genus may cause otitis media; symptoms of otitis media include ear pain, fever and a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane. A gram-negative oxidase-negative, non-lactose fermenting bacillus (choice B) describes some members (Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, and Salmonella) of the family Enterobacteriaceae. There are no agents of ear infections present in this group. Most of the Enterobacteriaceae are diarrhea-causing agents, or are causes of enteric fevers, neonatal meningitis, or urinary tract infections. A gram-positive, catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic coccus (choice D) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of otitis media but not of otitis externa, as in this case. A gram-positive catalase-negative beta-hemolytic coccus (choice E) describes Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae. S. pyogenes is a common cause of otitis media and S. agalactiae is the most common cause of neonatal septicemia and meningitis in the United States."

    "question": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a near-fatal fire. Over the next several days he develops pneumonia and progressive shortness of breath and is intubated. Gram stain of the sputum shows a gram-negative, encapsulated, oxidase-positive aerobic rod. Which of the following mechanisms allows the most likely causal organism to be resistant to many different antibiotics?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mutation of a penicillin-binding protein",
      "B. Mutation of a porin protein",
      "C. Mutation of a topoisomerase",
      "D. Plasmid-mediated acetyltransferase production",
      "E. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very common opportunist in burn patients, in whom it classically causes secondary wound infections and septicemia. It may also cause cystitis in patients with urinary catheters, and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. The organism is found in water and usually gains access to the body as a contaminant in the water used in respirators or in the water baths used to cleanse wounds. Pseudomonas is resistant to many antibiotics, and mutates to even more resistant strains during therapy. The most important means of resistance is through the mutation of a porin protein that restricts the flow of many antibiotics into the cell. Mutation of a penicillin-binding protein (choice A) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance exhibited by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mutation of a topoisomerase (choice C) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin that is exhibited by Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli. It is not, however considered the major mechanism of drug resistance to a wide variety of drugs. Plasmid-mediated acetyltransferase production (choice D) is a mechanism of drug resistance exhibited by Klebsiella and Enterobacter against gentamicin and by Salmonella against chloramphenicol. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production (choice E) is expressed in Pseudomonas and contributes to resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. It does not confer resistance to as many drugs as the alteration of the porin proteins, but is still a significant cause of resistance."

    "question": "A 2-week-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a one-day history of labored breathing. His home birth was uneventful and his immunizations are up-to-date but his mother reports that he developed conjunctivitis on the fourth day of life. He is afebrile and has a respiratory rate of 40/minute. Physical examination shows bilateral inspiratory crackles and a slight wheeze on auscultation of the chest. A chest x-ray is consistent with bilateral pneumonia. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 15,000/mm³ with 40% eosinophils. Which of the following is the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Chlamydia trachomatis",
      "C. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "D. Mycoplasma pneumoniae",
      "E. Neisseria gonorrhoeae",
      "F. Pneumocystis jiroveci",
      "G. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "H. Varicella zoster virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient presents with symptoms consistent with neonatal atypical pneumonia secondary to Chlamydia trachomatis. This agent is transmitted from the mother's vaginal secretions to the neonate at birth. The conjunctivitis precedes the pneumonitis. Tachypnea, hypoxemia, crackles, wheezing and eosinophilia are evident. Patients with mild to moderate illness with Chlamydia pneumonia may present with the 'staccato cough' (inspiration between each single cough). Chest x-ray may show scattered infiltrates and hyperinflation of the lungs. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) produces ascariasis and can cause pneumonia and eosinophilia. This is caused by ingestion of Ascaris eggs from human fecal contamination. Haemophilus influenzae (choice C) is an agent of pharyngitis, pneumonia, meningitis and epiglottitis in unvaccinated children between the ages of 3 months and 2 years. It would not be common in a neonate and would not associate with eosinophilia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (choice D) is the most common etiologic agent of atypical pneumonia in young people, but not in neonates. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (choice E) can cause ophthalmia neonatorum in this age-group of patient but would not be associated with pneumonia or eosinophilia. Pneumocystis jiroveci (choice F) causes pneumonia in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other immunocompromised patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice G) is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in adults, but would not be a common agent of pneumonia with eosinophilia following conjunctivitis in a neonate. Varicella (choice H) pneumonia is accompanied by pruritic skin lesions. Eosinophilia is not seen."

Examination of lower respiratory tract secretions obtained on transmural needle biopsy shows roughly spherical bodies with sharply outlined walls when stained with methenamine silver. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bordetella pertussis",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii)",
      "D. Respiratory syncytial virus",
      "E. Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The organism described is Pneumocystis jiroveci which is an opportunistic infection in premature infants and in patients with AIDS. It causes an atypical pneumonia due to the over-replication of type 2 pneumocytes and their production of surfactant-rich exudates, which fill the alveolar sacs and eventually cause death by asphyxiation. Bordetella pertussis (choice A) is the causative agent of whooping cough. The incidence of whooping cough has declined with the development of the vaccine. Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) is the causative agent of otitis media, epiglottitis, and meningitis in unvaccinated children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (choice D) would be a likely cause of respiratory distress in a premature infant, but the vignette describes the finding of spherical cysts with sharply outlined walls. RSV findings might indicate giant multinucleated cells or syncytia in the sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice E) is the most common cause of otitis media and pneumonia, but not in premature infants."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the physician because of painful, tingling lesions on her tongue. Physical examination shows vesicular lesions with associated erythema on the tongue. She says that she is preparing for her wedding in a few days. Which of the following best describes the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. A double-stranded DNA virus that has a complex lipid envelope",
      "B. A double-stranded DNA virus that is enveloped and icosahedral",

      "D. A gram-positive, catalase-positive, beta-hemolytic coccus",
      "E. A positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is nonsegmented and naked"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The painful vesicular lesions on the tongue are characteristic of herpes simplex virus, and the most common strain that causes these lesions above the waist is herpes simplex type 1. Herpes simplex belongs to the Herpesviridae, which are double-stranded DNA viruses that are enveloped with nuclear membrane and are icosahedral. Stress is frequently an activating stimulus that causes herpes gingivostomatitis to break out from its location of latent infection in the ganglia. A double-stranded DNA virus that has a complex lipid envelope (choice A) describes the Poxviridae, a family that contains smallpox virus and molluscum contagiosum virus. Of these, smallpox virus is extinct and molluscum contagiosum is a common cause of benign, wartlike lesions in young adults. Molluscum does not cause vesicular lesions but rather umbilicated warts, and would not be common on the tongue. A gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic coccus (choice C) describes either Streptococcus pyogenes or Strep. agalactiae. Of these, Strep. pyogenes does cause skin lesions (impetigo) in young children, but these are honey-crusted, not vesicular, and would not be common on the tongue in an adult. A gram-positive catalase-positive beta-hemolytic coccus (choice D) describes Staphylococcus aureus, which is another agent of impetigo in children. Staph. aureus causes bullous impetigo, characterized by vesicular lesions, but would not be common on the tongue. A positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is nonsegmented and naked (choice E) describes the family Picornaviridae which includes the agents of herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease. These coxsackieviruses cause blister-like lesions in the mouth but would not be common on the tongue. Hand, foot, and mouth disease presents with vesicular lesions in the front of the buccal mucosa, and herpangina manifests with lesions in the rear of the mouth on the palate and fauces."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This patient has mumps, which is caused by a negative-sense RNA virus in the Paramyxovirus family. This virus has been quite rare in the United States since the advent of the live-attenuated MMR vaccine. The mention of recent immigration suggests that the child may not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Bilateral parotitis and inflammation of the pancreas or testes are hallmarks of the infection in this age group. Other members of the Paramyxoviridae are parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles. The coronavirus family (choice A) includes corona virus and the SARS agent. The herpesvirus family (choice B) includes herpes simplex 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella zoster virus. The orthomyxovirus family (choice C) includes influenza virus. The reovirus family (choice E) includes rotavirus, reovirus, and Colorado tick fever virus."

Ketoacidotic diabetics are at risk for developing rhinocerebral infections following inhalation of the sporangiospores of these normally harmless bread molds. The fungi are identified by the nonseptate (ribbon-like) hyphae that branch at 90-degree angles. Arthroconidia and spherules (choices A and E) are the environmental form and diagnostic forms (respectively) of Coccidioides immitis, the causative agent of San Joaquin Valley fever. Monomorphic, encapsulated yeast (choice B) describes Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes meningitis in the immunocompromised. Septate hyphae branching at 45 degrees (choice D) describes Aspergillus, an opportunistic fungus that can cause sinus infections and spread to cause meningitis in the immunocompromised."

    "question": "A 38-year-old man with a history of hemophilia has had multiple infusions of clotting factors in his lifetime. Laboratory studies of ten batches of clotting factors administered to this patient show contamination with the human immunodeficiency virus, yet he has remained HIV-negative. The patient's CD4 count is 900/uL and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the virus is negative. Absence of which of the following cell surface receptors best explains the findings in this patient?",
    "options": ["A. CCR5", "B. CD4", "C. CD8", "D. Gp120", "E. TNF receptor"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection does not always progress to avert acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a few fortunate individuals (called nonprogressors) the infection remains asymptomatic, with a stable CD4 cell count and low or undetectable viremia. It is not entirely clear whether these patients will eventually develop AIDS. Some are resistant to HIV infection because they carry two defective copies of the gene encoding the CCR5 co-receptor. There are 15 known co-receptors, of which CCR5 and CXCR4 are the best characterized. CCR5 is a receptor for chemokines and serves as a co-receptor for HIV internalization into macrophages. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that serves as the co-receptor for HIV internalization into T lymphocytes. Approximately 1% of Caucasians in the United States are homozygous for such a protective CCR5 variant, and 20% are heterozygotes. HIV infection follows a slower course in heterozygotes. Homozygotes for this protective CCR5 variant are not present among Black and Asian populations. CD4 (choice B) is an important receptor of T-helper lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. It acts as the primary receptor for HIV binding. Binding to CD4, however, is not sufficient for the entry of HIV into the cells. Individuals without CD4 positive cells are defined as having a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and such a condition was not mentioned in the stem. The viral envelope gp120 protein (choice D) first binds CD4. This results in a conformational change in gp120 that allows this protein to bind co-receptors. Such co-receptors are present on lymphocytes and macrophages and normally serve as binding sites for chemokines. Once gp120 binds to CD4 and a co-receptor, a second viral protein gp41 facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, allowing 'injection' of the viral core into the cell. Neither CD8 (choice C) nor the receptor for TNF (choice E) plays a role in HIV binding to cells. CD8 is the co-receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes that stabilizes the interaction between the T cell receptor and the major histocompatibility molecule. The TNF receptor is a molecule on T lymphocytes that receives stimulatory signals from macrophages or in other cases receives apoptotic signals in various cells."

Which of the following diseases did this patient most likely have at 1 year of age?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mumps",
      "B. Parvovirus B19",
      "C. Polio",
      "D. Rubella",
      "E. Rubeola"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This child had subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is a very rare, late complication of measles (rubeola) infection at an early age. The existence of this complication is part of the rationale for immunizing children against measles at an early age. It is thought that the immune and neurologic systems of very young children may permit the virus to become established in the brain. The exact mechanism of injury is poorly understood, but the brain shows encephalitis involving both gray and white matter. Forty percent of cases die within 1 year, and it is thought that the disease is probably always eventually fatal. Mumps (choice A) causes parotitis and fever in young children, and causes the complications of pancreatitis and orchitis when older individuals acquire the infection. Mumps is not known to cause CNS pathology. Parvovirus B19 (choice B) causes erythema infectiosum, or slapped-cheek fever in school-age children, and hydrops fetalis in fetuses infected in utero. It is also associated with aplastic crises in sickle-cell anemia patients, but is not known to cause CNS pathology. Polio (choice C) spreads from the blood to the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and motor cortex of the brain. It causes an asymmetric flaccid paralysis without sensory loss. Spasticity is not a common finding in polio. Rubella (choice D) or German measles, causes a mild 3-day rash in adults but is known to be teratogenic in the fetus if a mother is infected during gestation. The syndrome in the neonate (congenital rubella syndrome) includes patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, cataracts, microcephaly, and deafness."

      "D. 600-799 cells/mm³",
      "E. Above 800 cells/mm³"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has progressed from being asymptomatic to the point that he has a condition attributed to HIV infection, but not an AIDS-defining condition. The most likely CD4 count associated with this stage of disease would be between 200 and 399 cells/mm³. A CD4 cell count of 0-199 (choice A) would be the expected count in a patient who has progressed to full-blown AIDS. Full-blown AIDS is defined by the presence of a variety of infections or conditions that demonstrate a life-threatening collapse of the immune system. Examples of such conditions would include HIV encephalopathy, Pneumocystis pneumonia, Kaposi sarcoma, cryptosporidiosis, or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. A CD4 cell count of 400-599 (choice C) is a range that would be associated with a finding of generalized lymphadenopathy or asymptomatic infection. The existence of thrush in the present patient indicates that he has progressed to the early symptomatic phase of the disease. A CD4 cell count in the range of 600-799 (choice D) would be expected in an asymptomatic patient without generalized lymphadenopathy or thrush. A CD4 cell count above 800 (choice E) is considered a normal value in an uninfected individual."

It causes acute and chronic lung infections as well as disseminated disease and is a special problem in the immunocompromised person. Coccidioidomycosis (choice B) is a fungus of the U.S. desert southwest. It also causes acute and chronic pulmonary infections, disseminated infections, and cutaneous lesions, but the tissue form would be spherules with endospores. Histoplasmosis (choice C) is endemic along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio river valleys of the United States. It causes acute and chronic pulmonary infections and disseminated infections in the immunocompromised. The tissue form is an intracellular, unencapsulated yeast.

      "D. Heterophile antibody test",
      "E. Weil-Felix test"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Candida albicans produces oral thrush, which is common in acute HIV disease and becomes increasingly common as the CD4+ cell count falls. Candida plaques can generally be scraped off easily while those in a similar condition in HIV-infected individuals, hairy leukoplakia, cannot. Diagnosis is by demonstration of pseudohyphae formation in animal serum, the basis of the germ-tube test. The CAMP test (choice A) is used to identify a partial hemolytic agent produced by Streptococcus agalactiae. It is used to distinguish between group A and group B streptococci, along with testing for bacitracin sensitivity. Group B streptococci cause neonatal meningitis and septicemia, not the oral lesions described here. The ELEK test (choice B) is used to identify toxin-producing strains of bacteria in the oropharynx that resemble Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is used to differentiate between the pathogen C. diphtheriae and normal flora diphtheroids. C. diphtheriae causes gray fibrinous exudates to form on the uvula and upper airways. It does not have an association with HIV infection. Heterophile antibody tests (choice D) are common in medicine in cases in which a causal agent is difficult to identify or culture. These tests depend on the detection of accidental cross-reactions between antibodies formed during an infection with an unrelated substance. Key examples of heterophile antibody tests include the Monospot test for Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis, the Weil-Felix test for rickettsial infections, and the VDRL for syphilis. None of these tests would be used to identify the cause of a white oral exudate in an AIDS patient. The Weil-Felix test (choice E) is a heterophile antibody test used in the diagnosis of several rickettsial diseases. It depends on the accidental cross-reaction between antibodies produced during rickettsial infections and the OX strain of Proteus vulgaris. Rickettsial diseases are arthropod-borne diseases that are all characterized by rashes. None of them would be consistent with the signs in this case."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vaginal itching and a yellow, malodorous discharge that is worse following her menses. She is sexually active with two partners and recently had unprotected sex Pelvic examination shows erythema of the cervix. Microscopic examination of vaginal secretions will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Clue cells",
      "B. Gram-negative diplococci",
      "C. Motile trophozoites",
      "D. Obligate intracellular pathogens",
      "E. Yeast"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan parasite that causes a sexually transmitted disease. The vaginitis it causes is characterized by a frothy yellow discharge. It causes spotty reddening of the mucosa that is referred to as a 'strawberry' mucosa. The organism can be identified in saline mounts of vaginal fluids by its characteristic corkscrew motility. This is caused by the fact that the organism has flagella on one end, and an undulating membrane going down its side that causes it to rotate on its longitudinal axis while it moves in a single direction. Clue cells (choice A) are the diagnostic clue for bacterial vaginosis (BV), usually due to overgrowth of the normal vaginal flora by Gardnerella vaginalis. BV would also have a malodorous discharge, but it would be thin and gray, not frothy and yellow. It is worse following menses, but is not always sexually associated. Gram-negative diplococci (choice B) describes Neisseria gonorrhoeae which would cause a neutrophil-rich discharge and erosions of the vaginal mucosa. A Gram stain of the neutrophilic discharge would show gram-negative diplococci. Obligate intracellular pathogens (choice D) describes Chlamydia trachomatis, serotypes D-K, which would not cause such a discharge. Yeast (choice E) is most likely Candida albicans, a common cause of vaginitis. Candida causes a white, cottage cheese-like discharge."

    "options": [
      "A. Hairy oral leukoplakia",
      "B. Heterophile-negative mononucleosis",
      "C. Hodgkin lymphoma",
      "D. Kaposi sarcoma",
      "E. Lymphoproliferative disease"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The most common agents causing congenital infection in the United States are cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Congenital CMV infection, which occurs in 1 to 2% of all live births in the United States, results from transplacental acquisition of a primary or recurrent maternal infection. Most infections are asymptomatic, but about 5% will present with hepatosplenomegaly, periventricular brain calcification, petechial hemorrhages, and hydrops. Sensorineural deafness is a common manifestation in affected infants. Primary infection of the mother is strongly associated with more severe symptoms in affected infants. The mortality rate is 30%, and most of the survivors will have neurologic impairment. CMV infections in children and adults are often asymptomatic; however the virus is responsible for 10% of infectious mononucleosis cases (characterized by an absence of sheep red blood cell agglutinins: heterophile-negative mononucleosis). CMV also causes serious disease in immunosuppressed patients, including bone-marrow recipients and AIDS patients. Ganciclovir is the drug of choice although foscarnet has also been used with some success. Hairy oral leukoplakia (choice A) is a condition caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in AIDS patients and is associated with hyperproliferation of the lingual epithelia. EBV although it belongs to the same family as CMV, is not associated with in utero infections. Hodgkin lymphoma (choice C) is associated with EBV. Kaposi sarcoma (choice D) is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpesvirus-8 coinfections. It is a sarcoma of endothelial cells. Although HIV can be acquired in utero, it would not be associated with thrombocytopenic purpura. Lymphoproliferative disease (choice E) is associated with EBV infections in AIDS patients."

      "A. Ingestion of poorly cooked fish",
      "B. Leukorrheic vaginal discharge",
      "C. Maculopapular, dark-colored rash",
      "D. Painful genital lesion",
      "E. Travel to Africa"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The findings described are those of tabes dorsalis, a form of tertiary syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum. Tabes dorsalis and other forms of tertiary syphilis are now uncommon in the United States; possibly because the common use of antibiotics may 'treat' many unsuspected cases of syphilis. The hallmark lesion of tertiary syphilis is the gumma, a syphilitic granuloma that forms in the central nervous system and in the vasculature. Tertiary syphilis is preceded by secondary syphilis, in which there is a maculopapular, bronzing rash and condylomata lata (flat, wartlike growths in the perianal or perigenital area). Primary syphilis is characterized by the finding of a painless, ulcerated genital lesion. Neurosyphilis can take many forms, including acute syphilitic meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, general paresis and/or optic atrophy. Tabes dorsalis is a slowly progressive degenerative neurologic disease that affects the dorsal columns with demyelination and the dorsal roots with inflammatory changes accompanied by fibrosis. There is loss of pain sensation and peripheral reflexes, accompanied by impairment of vibration and position senses, with progressive ataxia. Ingestion of poorly cooked fish (choice A) is the means of infection with Diphyllobothrium latum, which is a tapeworm that competes with the host for vitamin B12. As a result, the infection may mimic pernicious anemia, and it may also cause degeneration of the dorsal columns and roots of the spinal cord (subacute combined degeneration) that may closely mimic syphilis. However, the two conditions can be distinguished by the presence of a megaloblastic anemia in vitamin B12 deficiency. Leukorrheic vaginal discharge (choice B) would be observed in a woman with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, but is not found in any stage of syphilis. Painful genital ulcers (choice D) are caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, but the chancres of syphilis are painless and indurated. Travel to Africa (choice E) would likely be important in the history of a patient with granuloma inguinale (caused by Klebsiella granulomatis) or lymphogranuloma venereum (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1, L2 and L3) but would not be a prerequisite for a diagnosis of syphilis."

    "options": [
      "A. Alcohol consumption",
      "B. infection with Helicobacter pylori",
      "C. Nitrate content of the diet",
      "D. Pernicious anemia",
      "E. Tobacco use"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has gastric carcinoma, which has been strongly linked to prior gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori with subsequent development of intestinal metaplasia and gastric mucosal atrophy. H. pylori has also been implicated in the etiologies of gastric/peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis, and gastric lymphoma. The disease-causing strains of H. pylori contain a pathogenicity island containing the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and a type IV secretory system that injects the CagA protein into host cells. The relative risk factor associating H. pylori infection with gastric carcinoma is approximately 6.0. Alcohol consumption (choice A) has been shown in several studies to increase the risk of gastric carcinoma two-fold. High nitrate content of the diet (choice C) has been shown to increase the risk of gastric carcinoma by 1.2-fold. Pernicious anemia (choice D) has been associated with a three-fold increase in incidence of gastric carcinoma. Tobacco use (choice E) has been shown to increase the risk of gastric carcinoma almost five-fold."

      "A. Adenosine triphosphate",
      "B. Cell wall",
      "C. Cholesterol",
      "D. Cysteine",
      "E. Protoporphyrin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The disease is chlamydial cervicitis. This sexually transmitted infection is usually suspected after treatment for gonorrhea fails to relieve symptoms. However, a few cases are picked up when cytoplasmic inclusions composed of aggregates of Chlamydia are identified on Pap smears. Confirmation can be made with fluorescent antibodies that pick up both the aggregates and individual bacteria known as 'elementary bodies'. The organisms are obligate intracellular parasites because they have lost the ability to synthesize ATP. They also produce a cell wall that does not contain muramic acid, one of the two normal components of bacterial peptidoglycan. Cell wall (choice B) synthesis is absent in Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma but all other prokaryotes possess a cell wall. Chlamydia have an unusual cell wall made only of N-acetyl-glutamic acid, but it is still a cell wall. Failure to synthesize cholesterol (choice C) is not usually a problem for prokaryotes since they do not have sterols in their cell membranes. Mycoplasmas however, require cholesterol in their diet so that they can include sterols in their unique membranes. Cysteine (choice D) is required by four genera of bacteria (Legionella, Pasteurella, Brucella, and Francisella), but not by Chlamydia. Protoporphyrin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (choice E) are required by Haemophilus organisms, but not Chlamydia."

Most giant cells are composed of histiocytes, but the WF giant cell is created by fusion of lymphocytes. Although postvaccinal lymphadenitis may be seen with different vaccines, the usual reaction is immunoblastic proliferation within the paracortical regions of a hyperplastic lymph node.

Physical examination shows swelling of the ankles and wrists and a maculopapular rash over the same areas. Which of the following is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of his illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenylate cyclase exotoxin production",
      "B. Coagulase positivity",
      "C. Granulomatous inflammation",
      "D. Immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity",
      "E. intracellular infection of endothelial cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This clinical description is most consistent with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which (despite the name) is actually more common in the Eastern United States and is due to tickborne Rickettsia rickettsii. The organism has a predilection for infecting endothelial cells, thereby causing a vasculitis that damages many tissues, including the skin and kidney. The mortality rate is as high as 10% in some series of cases. Adenylate cyclase exotoxin production (choice A) is characteristic of Bacillus anthracis. Inhalation anthrax is manifested as a fatal hemorrhagic mediastinal lymphadenitis. Cutaneous anthrax presents as an eschar with a black, necrotic center and a raised hemorrhagic ring, but a rash beginning on the ankles and wrists would not occur. Other organisms that produce an adenylate cyclase toxin include enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae, which are diarrheal agents. Coagulase positivity (choice B) is characteristic of Yersinia pestis which causes plague. It is endemic in the southwestern United States, transmitted from infected rodents by the bite of a flea. The initial lesion of bubonic plague is an enlarged, hemorrhagic lymph node near the site of a flea bite; fever and malaise are associated with tightness in the chest but there is no rash. Staphylococcus aureus is also coagulase-positive, but in toxic shock syndrome, the rash would involve the palms and soles and would not move in the manner described here. Granulomatous inflammation (choice C) is characteristic of Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. Tularemia is most common in Arkansas and Missouri, and usually presents as a papule progressing to a necrotic, ulcerative lesion. It is associated with fever, chills, and malaise, but presents with a rash in only about 20% of cases. Immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity (choice D) is a component of the late-phase arthritis and arthralgia caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease. The rash of Lyme disease is target-shaped, with concentric hyperemic rings."

      "C. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "D. Wucheria bancrofti",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This man has the symptoms of Lyme disease caused by the large spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.

Plasmodium malariae and Wucheria bancrofti (choices B and D) are both transmitted by mosquitoes. Rickettsia rickettsii (choice C) is also transmitted by a tick but it is the Dermacentor tick rather than the Ixodes tick. Francisella tularensis is also transmitted by the Dermacentor tick.

      "C. Cannot make ATP",
      "D. No true cell wall",
      "E. Visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Having both hyphae and spores (choice B) would be true of Candida, which usually causes arthritis as a rare complication of systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma do not have true cell walls (choice D) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete that is visible only with darkfield microscopy (choice E) or direct fluorescent antibody. Secondary syphilis can (uncommonly) cause an acute arthritis, but syphilis is rare in an otherwise healthy adult."

      "A. catalase",
      "B. Hemolysin",
      "C. Hyaluronidase",
      "D. streptokinase",
      "E. Tetanospasmin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome. Tetanospasmin (choice E) is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It inhibits the inhibitory mediators glycine and GABA, and promotes the rigid paralysis of tetanus. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome."

      "A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "E. Streptococcus salivarius"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx; constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx and a tonsillar exudate. Streptococcus salivarius (choice E) is a gram-positive coccus that is usually alpha-hemolytic. It is normal flora of the oral cavity and is sometimes implicated in subacute bacterial endocarditis, but is not associated with tonsillar abscesses."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Streptococcus bovis is a group D Streptococcus. There is a significant association between S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon and other colonic diseases. Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are reported to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. The group D Streptococci are distinguished by having a cell wall carbohydrate composed of glycerol teichoic acid. S. agalactiae (choice A) is a group B Streptococcus that is the number-one cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia in the United States. S. mutans and S. sanguis (choices C and F) are viridans streptococci, which are normal flora of the oral mucosa. While they are associated with bacterial endocarditis, it is usually associated with invasive dental work and a preexisting heart valve defect. S. pneumoniae (choice D) which is a non-groupable Streptococcus (it does not have a C cell wall carbohydrate), is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in the United States.

    "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of a several month history of chronic fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats.

      "E. Virus, p24, RNA Undetectable | CD4+ Normal | Anti-p24 Decreasing | Anti-env Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 525/mm³, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient, measured by RT-PCR for viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Antibodies against the envelope glycoproteins are generally IgM, which does not require a primary immune response. The IgM anti-env antibody can be made in the absence of TH cells. Increasing p24 virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood. This does not happen in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This young woman is infected with Chlamydia trachomatis the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells. It has sterols in its membrane (choice A) is a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These are the only prokaryotes that totally lack a cell wall, but instead have sterols in their membranes. It lacks a cell wall (choice B) is also a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These prokaryotes are devoid of a cell wall but have sterols in their membranes. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol (choice C) is a statement that describes the fungi. The ergosterol molecule is unique to fungi and is the target molecule for nystatin and the imidazoles.

    "options": [
      "A. It blocks ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase",
      "B. It inhibits the CYP450—dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase",
      "C. It inhibits the synthesis of beta-glucan",
      "D. It interferes with mitotic spindle function",
      "E. It interferes with thymidylate synthetase and DNA synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test, the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the “conazole” antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A). This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patients oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum. Flucytosine interferes with thymidylate synthetase (choice E). This agent is used in the treatment of cryptococcosis. It is contraindicated in HIV patients, as it may cause bone marrow suppression in those patients."

    "question": "A medical virology laboratory coinfects cells in a tissue culture flask with influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1). The flask is incubated for 48 hours and the progeny viruses are analyzed. Four distinct variants of influenza A are isolated: H3N2, H1N1, H3N1, and H1N2 Which of the following viral attributes most likely made the production of H3N1 and H1N2 variants possible?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. High mutational rate",
      "C. Phenotypic mixing",
      "D. segmented genome",
      "E. Syncytia formation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

      "A. Ecthyma gangrenosum",
      "B. Erythema migrans",
      "C. Food poisoning",
      "D. Nonmycotic mycetoma",
      "E. Pharyngitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes malignant otitis externa which is a severe necrotizing infection of the external ear canal. Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone, temporal bone, sigmoid sinus, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Patients at increased risk include the elderly, people with diabetes, and the immunocompromised. Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes (since the organism can be cultured from the shoes), burn infections, and pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients. Ecthyma gangrenosum is the name of the characteristic lesion that occurs during Pseudomonas septicemias. It has a black, necrotic center and a raised hemorrhagic ring outside. Erythema migrans (choice B) is the target-shaped rash that occurs in the early stages of Lyme disease. Food poisoning (choice C) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas. Nonmycotic mycetoma (choice D) is caused by Actinomyces and Nocardia. Pharyngitis (choice E) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas."

      "D. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus",
      "E. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, naked, icosahedral virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Outbreaks occur seasonally in winter and early spring. Infection does not result in lasting immunity, and reinfection can occur. The virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, a group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are nonsegmented, helical, and enveloped. Double-stranded DNA, naked, icosahedral virus (choice A) describes the Adenoviruses, which are capable of causing conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. However, these agents are not common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Negative-sense single-stranded RNA with eight segments, helical, enveloped virus (choice C) describes the Orthomyxoviruses, which include influenza virus. Influenza is a systemic illness characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache myalgias, malaise, and prostration, followed by cough, nasal obstruction, and sore throat. The lower respiratory tract may also be involved. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus (choice D) describes the Coronaviruses, which cause the common cold (nasal obstruction and discharge, sneezing, mild or no fever, occasional sore throat, and/or cough) and acute pharyngitis (sore throat with or without cervical adenopathy, ulceration, and conjunctivitis). SARS-CoV also belongs to this family and causes a seasonal acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is usually imported into this hemisphere from the Far East. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA naked, icosahedral virus (choice E) describes the Picornaviruses and Caliciviruses. Within the Picornaviridae, rhinoviruses cause the common cold but would not be common agents of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants."

      "A. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes",
      "B. Introns",
      "C. Points of bacteriophage insertion",
      "D. Points of site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. A resistance transfer factor is a bacterial plasmid that encodes one or more drug-resistance genes and has the capability of mediating its own transfer to another bacterium during conjugation (it possesses the F operon). Most of the known resistance transfer factors have been formed by the accumulation of transposons into fertility factor plasmids. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are capable of movement within bacterial cells. When they carry drug-resistance genes and accumulate in plasmids that already possess the F operon, multiple drug-resistant plasmids (resistance transfer factors) are formed. The flanking sequences in the DNA of a transposon are indirect repeats that are complementary and antiparallel to one another. When transposons insert themselves into a new location, they do so by site-specific recombination, creating direct repeats (identical nucleotide sequences created during the repair of a staggered cut created by the transposon restriction endonuclease). Therefore, in the diagram shown, the rectangular blocks could represent either the direct repeats caused by transposition or the indirect repeats that are the outside edges of the mobile segments of DNA. In either event, they are representations of points at which transposons have inserted their mobile DNA via site-specific recombination. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes (choice A) is not correct. Although each transposon (and there are three that have moved to create the resistance transfer factor shown) carries its own restriction endonuclease and the gene that encodes it, the diagram clearly shows the presence of two rectangles for each of the transposons, and a given transposon would carry only one copy, not two copies, of its endonuclease gene. Introns (choice B) are repetitive, non-transcribed segments of DNA that do not occur in prokaryotes. Points of bacteriophage insertion (choice C) or insertion sequences are palindromic sequences of nucleotides in a bacterial genome that are identical to those found in the genomes of temperate phages. When these sequences are cleaved by a restriction endonuclease the phage genome can be inserted by site-specific recombination into the bacterial chromosome and the state of lysogeny is begun. Bacteriophages are not involved in the formation of resistance transfer factors. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are responsible for the formation of multiple drug-resistant plasmids such as the one shown here, but they are not represented by the rectangular blocks. In the diagram, the transposons are the sequences between the rectangular blocks, so there are three transposons that accumulated here to create this resistance transfer factor."

    "question": "A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain over the past 24 hours. She recently returned from a 4-month trip to Central America. She says that she had bloody diarrhea for the last 4 weeks of her trip. A CT scan of the abdomen shows lesions that appear to be multiple abscesses. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "C. Enterobius vermicularis",
      "D. Salmonella typhi",
      "E. Shigella species"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient probably has hepatic amebiasis, which is a life-threatening complication of intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. E. histolytica is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Intestinal colonization (which may be asymptomatic) always precedes infection of the liver. The abscesses generally contain necrotic debris, with amoebas located along the edges of the abscess. Treatment for liver abscesses of this origin is metronidazole, while iodoquinol is useful to destroy the luminal stages of the parasite. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) can cause intestinal obstruction, and may cause abscesses if it invades the common bile duct. It would not cause bloody diarrhea. Enterobius vermicularis (choice C) is the pinworm, which inhabits the rectum. Bloody diarrhea can also be seen with some strains of Salmonella (choice D) and Shigella (choice E), but these organisms do not usually cause hepatic abscesses. Bacterial causes of hepatic abscesses include E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas."

      "E. Septate hyphae at 45-degree angles",
      "F. spherules"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This is a classic case of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis. Clues include the patient population (HIV-positive), and the CSF findings suggesting a fungal etiology. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal meningitis of the immunocompromised in the United States. It is a monomorphic fungus, unlike many of the classic pathogens within the fungal group, so the encapsulated yeast form would be found both in clinical specimens and in the environment as the infectious form. Broad-based, budding yeasts (choice A) would be the forms expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Blastomyces dermatitidis - which is far more likely to present with skin and bone lesions than with meningitis. Budding yeasts in a 'pilot's wheel' arrangement (choice B) would be the form expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis which is limited in geographic region to Central and South America and typically presents as a primary pulmonary disease. Intracellular yeasts within macrophages (choice D) are the diagnostic form of Histoplasma capsulatum which, despite its name, is not an encapsulated yeast. It is primarily a pulmonary infection acquired by exposure to the droppings of birds or bats. Septate hyphae with 45-degree angles (choice E) are the transmission forms of Aspergillus which is a major opportunistic infection. Aspergillus may cause meningitis in this patient population, but it is not nearly as common as Cryptococcus. Spherules (choice F) would be the yeast forms characteristic of Coccidioides immitis which may be a cause of fungal meningitis in immunologically compromised individuals but is geographically restricted to the Sonoran desert zone of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever)."

The physician should monitor this pregnancy closely for the development of which of the fetal conditions?",
    "options": [
      "A. Congenital heart disease",
      "B. Cutaneous scarring",
      "C. Hemolytic anemia",
      "D. Hydrocephalus",
      "E. Non-immune hydrops"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. There are two parts to this question. The first is realizing that the student's illness is the classic description of Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum. It is caused by parvovirus B19, which is spread from human to human. Animals do not carry this particular parvovirus. The disease is contagious prior to the onset of the rash. The initial symptoms, during the period of contagion, are nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, myalgia, lethargy, coryza, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain. When the typical 'slapped-cheek' rash begins, the student is no longer contagious. The rash begins with the erythematous cheeks, then the upper part of the body becomes red and then reticulated, i.e., the typical lacy appearance of the rash develops. This fades but can come and go for the next 3 weeks. Parvovirus is a cause of aplastic anemia. It may be responsible for aplastic crises in patients with sickle-cell anemia. In addition, exposure of a pregnant woman in the first trimester may result in a fetus with aplastic anemia, which results in non-immune hydrops fetalis. Because the virus infects immature erythrocytes, causing severe anemia, the fetus dies of cardiac failure. Congenital heart defects (choice A) may occur due to many different reasons. They are, however associated with the congenital rubella syndrome, in which a patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis are most commonly seen. Cutaneous scarring (choice B) occurs in an infant with congenital varicella syndrome (exposure to varicella during pregnancy). The other major feature is limb defects. Hemolytic anemias (choice C) are usually not associated with prenatal exposure to an infectious agent. They may be produced due to isoimmunization (Rh disease), red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis), or red cell enzyme defects (pyruvate kinase deficiency), as well as many other etiologies. Hydrocephalus (choice D) also has diverse etiologies. There is an association with prenatal exposure to mumps and the fetal development of aqueductal stenosis resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus."

Which of the following mechanisms is responsible for the expression of the toxin that produces these signs?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Homologous recombination",
      "C. Lysogenic conversion",
      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The question describes a girl with streptococcal pharyngitis with a characteristic rash. This combination is scarlet fever, and is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes via its erythrogenic exotoxin (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, SPE). SPE-A, SPE-B, and SPE-C. The production of this extra virulence is an example of lysogenic conversion. In this case, the DNA of a temperate phage is inserted into the bacterial chromosome and produces a prophage. Besides the repressor protein, the prophage DNA also directs the synthesis of other gene products that make the bacteria more pathogenic. Conjugation (choice A) is one of the three methods whereby DNA is transferred from one cell to another. In this case, it is done by cell-to-cell contact. It is not the means by which the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins are expressed. Homologous recombination (choice B) is a gene exchange process that stabilizes some genes that have been introduced by conjugation, transformation, or transduction. During the process there is an exchange of pieces of DNA between a linear piece of DNA and a region on the stable circular bacterial chromosome. In site-specific recombination (choice D) a DNA molecule is integrated into a molecule of DNA with which it has no homology, except for a small site on each DNA that is called an insertion site. The end result is the sum of the two original DNA molecules. Transformation (choice E) is another way in which genes are transferred. In this case, naked DNA is taken up by another cell. Cells that can take up naked DNA from the environment need to become competent, and do so under certain environmental conditions. The newly introduced DNA is generally linear, homologous DNA from the same type of cell, but one that may be genetically diverse. Once introduced into the new cell, some genes may become stabilized by homologous recombination."

    "question": "During an investigational study, new combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules are found on the progeny viruses of a prevalent serotype of the swine influenza virus and the prevalent serotype of the human influenza virus. The progeny viruses are genetically stable when purified and are used to infect new tissue cultures. Which of the following mechanisms most likely accounts for the production of the new viral progeny?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. Genetic drift",
      "C. Genetic shift",
      "D. Phenotypic masking",
      "E. Phenotypic mixing"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza and other viruses with segmented genomes (Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus) are capable of genetic reassortment. This is an accidental 'shuffling' of the segments of genomic RNA so that new genetic combinations can be produced. Viruses that have segmented genomes have multiple pieces of RNA that must be assembled correctly in the progeny to produce a new generation that is identical to the parental generation. When accidental rearrangements occur, genetic shift results; and in influenza, this is responsible for the production of pandemics of disease. Complementation (choice A) occurs when two viruses infect a single cell. If one is defective in a certain gene product, progeny viruses can be produced as long as that defect can be 'complemented' by the makeup of the other virus. If both viruses have the same defect, no progeny viruses can be produced. In the case given here, two viable viruses were grown in a single cell and new combinations of surface molecules were produced. Genetic drift (choice B) refers to random mutational changes that can occur in any reproducing organism. These changes can change the surface of the organism, which affects the host immune response to the organism. Changes such as these are more gradual than genetic shift, and are best described in viruses such as HIV. Phenotypic masking (choice D) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is created from the genome of one of the viruses while the genome included in the capsid is from the other virus. Thus, one genome is 'masked' or covered with the antigens of the other virus. In the case described here, combinations of surface molecules were expressed. Phenotypic mixing (choice E) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is a mixture of the capsid antigens from the two parental viruses. Since the genomic RNA is not actually reassorted in that case, it would not be a stable genetic change but simply a reflection of the antigens of both parental viruses being inserted on the surfaces of a single progeny generation."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen that is associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and that commonly causes cystitis. It is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod that reduces nitrates to nitrites. It is important to know that the pili and motility of the bacteria contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with cystitis can develop bacteremia and subsequent septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The present patient has an obstructive lesion of the urinary tract that predisposes him to the overgrowth of microorganisms such as E. coli. Pulmonary symptoms are consistent with ARDS. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) might be a Neisseria sp. or Moraxella catarrhalis. N. gonorrhoeae is the cause of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that presents asymptomatically or with urethritis. Patients are usually younger and sexually active. M. catarrhalis is usually implicated as a cause of otitis media and sinusitis in children. It is also implicated as a cause of purulent tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in a population of patients who are older than 50 years and who have underlying obstructive lung disease. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis rarely cause cystitis. S. saprophyticus causes UTIs but the patients are typically young, sexually active women. Enterococcus is a relatively common cause of UTIs in hospitalized patients with indwelling urinary catheters who are receiving broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Enterococcal bacteremia can lead to endocarditis, but would not commonly cause ARDS. Gram-positive diplococci (choice D) would be a description of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia.

These infections are most common in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America and are associated with a very high mortality among pregnant women. Hepatitis E is caused by a naked capsid RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae (formerly Caliciviridae). Adenoviridae (choice A) is a group of naked capsid double-stranded DNA viruses that may cause upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis, but are not generally associated with hepatitis.

Which of the following viruses would be capable of replication in these enucleated cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Cytomegalovirus",
      "C. Influenza virus",
      "D. JC virus",
      "E. Poliovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Most RNA viruses (e.g., poliovirus) replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore can replicate in enucleated cells. Poliovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae. These viruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA. The exception to the rule regarding RNA viruses is the family Orthomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses (choice C). Orthomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral mRNA transcription. Adenoviruses (choice A) are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome. All DNA viruses except the family Poxviridae carry out their replication in the nucleus, and therefore would not be capable of completing their life cycles in enucleated cells. Cytomegalovirus (choice B) is a member of family Herpesviridae. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome, and thus replicates in the nucleus. JC virus (choice D) belongs to family Polyomaviridae. It is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded circular DNA genome. It would not be able to complete its life cycle in an enucleated cell."

    "question": "A total of 2 x 10² Streptococcus viridans are inoculated into a flask containing 1 L of enriched broth. If the lag time is 30 minutes and the generation time is 20 minutes, how many bacteria will there be in the culture after 2.5 hours?",
    "options": [
      "A. 6 x 10²",
      "B. 12 x 10²",
      "C. 16 x 10²",
      "D. 32 x 10²",
      "E. 128 x 10²"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. During the lag time by definition, bacteria newly introduced into a culture will undergo metabolic changes necessary for use of the medium, but will not increase in number. Therefore, at the end of the first 30 minutes of elapsed time the number of bacteria in the culture will be 2 x 10². Thereafter, the number of bacteria will double every 20 minutes (the definition of 'generation time'). This means that after 2.5 hours (150 minutes) of total elapsed time, 120 minutes (150 min - 30 min lag) will be available for growth. Since generation time is 20 minutes, six generations will have occurred (120 min / 20 min/gen = 6 gen). So the original inoculum will double six times: 2 x 10² * 2⁶ = 2 x 10² * 64 = 128 x 10². Choice A (6 x 10²) is not the correct answer. The student who selects this answer forgot that lag periods occur only once per culture, and also incorrectly multiplied the starting inoculum number by an incorrect number of generations (three). Choice B (12 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of counting the number of possible generations and multiplying by that number. Remember that every generation time means that every bacterium in that culture has divided into two, so the student must multiply by 2 six times, or 2⁶. Choice C (16 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of forgetting that the lag time occurs only one time per culture. The student who selects this answer divided the 2.5 hours of culture time between three lag periods and three correctly calculated generations (2³). Choice D (32 x 10²) is not the correct answer and reflects the common student error of including the lag period within the first generation time (overlapping the two, and forgetting that they are distinct and separate periods). The student who did this would therefore count five possible generations and, multiplying correctly thereafter by 2⁵, would arrive at this incorrect answer."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man with AIDS develops multifocal encephalitis. He reports having a unilateral, vesicular rash 1 month ago Treatment with acyclovir is begun, but he dies on the fourth day after admission. Which of the following viruses is most likely responsible for the development of encephalitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus",
      "B. Herpes simplex type-1",
      "C. Herpes simplex type-2",
      "D. Herpes zoster",
      "E. Measles virus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The specific clue to the cause of the severe encephalitis in this AIDS patient is the history of shingles, due to reactivation of the herpes zoster (varicella zoster) virus. In otherwise healthy adults, the virus (which is usually introduced to the body as a childhood case of chickenpox) remains dormant in a dorsal root ganglion only to reactivate in later life, causing a painful vesicular eruption that characteristically conforms to the distribution of a single dermatome. In AIDS patients, the virus can cause a severe multifocal encephalitis that may be resistant to acyclovir therapy. Cytomegalovirus (choice A) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but is less likely in the present patient, given his past history of shingles. Herpes simplex type-1 (choice B) and type-2 (choice C) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but are less likely in this patient, given his past history of shingles and the lack of response to acyclovir. Measles virus (choice E) appears to be related to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis but this condition is not specifically increased in AIDS patients."

The lesion appeared several weeks ago, but recently has expanded and become painful. Physical examination shows a 5-cm lesion with a black, necrotic center and raised erythematous edges. Which of the following toxins has a mechanism of action most similar to the toxin most likely responsible for this patient's skin lesion?",

      "H. Shigatoxin",
      "I. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins",
      "J. Tetanus toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient's wound is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the characteristic lesion described is called ecthyma gangrenosum. The Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which is responsible for the tissue damage, inhibits protein synthesis by acting on EF-2, with a primary target cell in the liver. The diphtheria toxin has a similar action, although its target cells are heart and nerve. Anthrax toxin (choice A) is a three-component toxin that contains a single binding component (protective antigen) and two active components. The edema factor (EF) is an adenylate cyclase that causes fluid loss from cells, and the lethal factor (LF) is an endoprotease that causes apoptosis. Botulinum toxin (choice B) is a neurotoxin that prevents neurosecretory vesicles from fusing with synaptic membranes and releasing acetylcholine. Cholera toxin (choice C) acts to increase adenylate cyclase activity by ribosylation of GTP-binding protein. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (choice D) is a lecithinase. Escherichia coli labile toxin (choice F) works in a fashion similar to the cholera toxin. Pertussis toxin (choice G) causes fluid loss by ribosylating Gi. Shigatoxin (choice H) decreases protein synthesis by inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins (choice I) act as superantigens to increase cytokine production. Tetanus toxin (choice J) is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA."

    "question": "A 4-year-old girl who recently emigrated from Somalia is brought fo the emergency department by her parents because of a fever and persistent cough. Her temperature is 40.1°C (104.2°F). Physical examination shows inspiratory stridor, and a thick, gray film covering the uvula and pharynx that bleeds when displaced with a tongue depressor. Cultures of the oropharyngeal secretions grow gram-positive rods. In the image above, the patient's isolate is strain 1. Which of the following best describes strain 1?",
    "options": [
      "A. It contains an episome",
      "B. It contains free plasmid DNA",
      "C. It contains a prophage",
      "D. It is not a diphtheroid",
      "E. It is a motile organism"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has developed diphtheria, which is rare in the United States because of our use of a very effective vaccine, the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis). Immigrant children from impoverished areas of the globe might not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is a gram-positive rod that is morphologically identical to normal flora organisms in the oropharynx, which are called diphtheroids. The difference between the pathogen and a normal flora diphtheroid is established using the ELEK test, which is shown in the image. This test involves diffusion in gel and a precipitation reaction that will occur when antigen (toxin) produced by the pathogen precipitates in the presence of antitoxin antibodies. In the image, the horizontal lines are the strains of bacteria to be tested for the production of the toxin. The vertical rectangle is a strip of filter paper that has been soaked in antitoxin antibodies. The white lines that form in the right angle where bacteria and filter paper meet are lines of precipitation. In C. diphtheriae, toxin production occurs following infection of the bacterium with a temperate phage that encodes the toxin. This is an example of lysogenic conversion. Episomes (choice A) are plasmids that have integrated into a bacterial chromosome; Diphtheria toxin is produced following stable integration of a phage genome into the chromosome, not due to the integration of plasmid DNA. Containing free plasmid DNA (choice B) is not the distinction between toxin-producing and non-producing strains of C. diphtheriae. The tetanus toxin is produced by virtue of possession of a non-conjugative plasmid by Clostridium tetani, but this is not true of diphtheria. It is not a diphtheroid (choice D). A diphtheroid is a non-toxin producing strain of C. diphtheriae (a normal flora organism). The strains that are streaked in the image as the two central lines are non-toxin producers (diphtheroids). It is a motile organism (choice E) is not the case and motility is not tested by the ELEK test. C. diphtheriae is a nonmotile organism, and the eventual development of peripheral neuropathies and cardiomyopathies during the pathogenesis are a result of the fact that the toxin becomes bloodborne, not that the organism moves from its site of residence in the oropharynx and upper airways."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man who is a farmer develops a pustule on the hand. The pustule ruptures to form a black eschar surrounded by expanding edema. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the development of these symptoms in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. A boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod",
      "B. A cigar-shaped yeast",
      "C. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine",
      "D. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining",
      "E. A large spirochete"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causative organism, Bacillus anthracis is found in many animal species, and humans can acquire the organism either through contact with animals or from locally contaminated soil. The pustule described in the question stem is called a 'malignant pustule' and may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy. Malignant pustules after rupture form a black eschar surrounded by edema. Most cases remain localized but death can occur as the result of complications such as bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Bacillus is a large, boxcar-shaped, gram-positive rod that forms spores centrally placed inside the bacillus, so that they look like bamboo shoots. A cigar-shaped yeast (choice B) describes the tissue form of Sporothrix schenckii, the agent of rose-gardener's disease. The lesion in such a case would be a mycetoma, draining yellow granular pus through multiple sinus tracts. A gram-negative rod requiring cysteine (choice C) describes Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia. The organism can persist for weeks to months but does not form spores that could survive for hundreds or thousands of years. Most human cases occur in the endemic areas of the United States, in Arkansas and Missouri. A gram-negative rod with bipolar staining (choice D) describes Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague. This organism does not form stable spores that can survive for extended periods of time. The hallmark of bubonic plague is the formation of buboes which are black, necrotic lymph nodes that form at the site of the vector fleabite. A large spirochete (choice E) describes Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme disease. In the first stage of this disease, there is a localized, expanding, erythematous rash rather than an eschar. Furthermore, Lyme disease occurs in the United States, Europe, and Asia, corresponding to the distribution of Ixodes ticks, which spread the infection."

    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative diplococci",
      "B. Gram-negative rods",
      "C. Gram-positive cocci",
      "D. Gram-positive rods",
      "E. Monomorphic yeast",
      "F. Septate hyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of meningitis in immunocompromised patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in this case are consistent with a fungal infection in the central nervous system (100-1000 cells, mostly lymphocytes, glucose <50 mg/dL, protein >=50 mg/dL). Cryptococcus is a monomorphic encapsulated yeast. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. While this patient is in the appropriate age group for meningococcal meningitis, his HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Gram-negative rods (choice B) would be indicative of any of the enteric organisms, particularly Escherichia coli. E. coli is an agent of neonatal meningitis and septicemia, but the patient's HIV status, age, and CSF findings refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive cocci (choice C) would be indicative of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of adult meningitis, but the CSF findings in this case refute a bacterial etiology. Gram-positive rods (choice D) would be indicative of Listeria monocytogenes, which also could be a feasible answer but again, the patient's HIV status and CSF findings indicate Cryptococcus. Septate hyphae (choice F) would describe Aspergillus fumigatus, which is another fungal agent of meningitis in the immunocompromised, but it is not the most likely cause."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man develops malaise, fatigue, and anorexia after returning from a trip to Calcutta, India. His symptoms slowly resolve and he does not seek treatment. Three months later laboratory studies of serum show HBsAb Negative, HBeAb Positive, HBcAb Positive, HBeAg Negative, HBsAg Negative. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb is likely indicative of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. The patient has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B",
      "B. The patient is anergic to hepatitis B",
      "C. The patient is immune to hepatitis B",
      "D. The patient is in the window period",
      "E. The patient is making an excess of HBsAb"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has clearly returned from Calcutta with an active infection of hepatitis B, since his serum is positive for antibody against the core antigen of hepatitis B. This is the standard diagnostic for this infection. The absence of HBsAg and HBsAb from the serum reflects that the patient has entered the 'window period,' a good prognostic indicator because it demonstrates that antibodies to the surface antigen are being made in enough concentration to precipitate the corresponding antigen out of the circulation. Successful vaccination against hepatitis B (choice A) would be reflected by a positive titer of HBsAb only. The presence of antibody against the e core antigen reflects the existence of an active infection. Anergy to hepatitis B (choice B) is not correct because a person who is anergic is selectively unresponsive or tolerant to the antigen in question. Clearly, the presence of antibodies to several of these viral antigens in the serum demonstrates that this patient is not anergic. Although the patient is beginning to mount a protective immune response (antibody to HBsAg, choice C), it has not yet reached a protective level. If the patient were making an excess of HBsAb (choice E), there would be a rising titer of HBsAb. Thus the patient would be positive for HBsAb and negative for HBsAg."

    "question": "An investigator is conducting a study of resistance of enterococcal species against penicillin and tetracycline. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for the acquisition of this type of multi-drug resistance?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacteriophage",
      "B. Exogenotes",
      "C. Prophage",
      "D. Restriction endonuclease",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Transposons are mobile segments of DNA that can move themselves or a copy of themselves from one molecule of DNA to another. They are found in eukaryotic cells, bacteria, and viruses. They need at least one gene coding for a transposase, which are the enzymes involved in this movement. The transposase recognizes a specific nucleotide sequence, and the DNA inserts into this position. This insertion creates direct repeats on each side of the transposon. Transposons include some genes for drug resistance and play an important role in building multiple-drug resistance plasmids. These multi-drug resistance plasmids have played a major role in the explosive spread of drug resistances throughout the bacterial world. Bacteriophages (choice A) are viruses that infect the bacterial cell. Temperate phage DNA may be inserted into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Imported bacterial DNA (i.e., DNA that has been transferred into a cell by conjugation, transformation, or transduction) is on short linear pieces of DNA called exogenotes (choice B). Most linear DNA is not stable in cells because it is broken down by exonucleases. Although technically all transferred DNA involved in emerging drug resistances is of exogenote origin, this is not the best answer because it is not specific enough. A prophage (choice C) is a repressed temperate phage DNA inserted into a bacterial chromosome. The prophage DNA may encode the synthesis of products that make bacteria more pathogenic. This enhanced virulence is called lysogenic conversion. Bacteriophages are known to transmit vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Restriction endonucleases (choice D) are site-specific endonucleases that recognize specific base sequences and cleave the nucleic acid backbone in the interior of the nucleic acid strand. Although restriction endonucleases are involved in transposon movement, they are not the means by which the drug resistances are acquired."

      "B. Image B",
      "C. Image C",
      "D. Image D",
      "E. Image E"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has a fungus ball, or aspergilloma. These noninvasive or minimally locally invasive lesions are caused by Aspergillus species. They show saprophytic growth in preexisting lung cavities, which may be formed by tuberculosis, tumor, bronchiectasis, or other chronic lung infections. Patients are often asymptomatic but may become allergic to the fungus. Aspergillus fumigatus is a dematiaceous (dark-colored) fungus which forms hyphae that branch at acute angles. Choice A is an image of the arthroconidia of Coccidioides immitis. These are the infectious forms that are found in desert sand. Coccidioides causes San Joaquin Valley fever, which may be an acute or chronic pulmonary condition but is unlikely to invade cavitary lesions of the lung and cause fungus balls. Choice B is an image of the infectious form of Sporothrix schenckii that causes rose-gardener's disease. These are hyphae with sleeves of conidia that would be found in vegetative material in gardens worldwide. Sporothrix causes cutaneous or lymphocutaneous lesions associated with puncture wounds formed while gardening or handling plant material. Choice D is an image of germ tubes (pseudohyphae) formed by Candida albicans when it invades tissues. Candida is an opportunistic pathogen, but it does not cause fungus balls by invading cavitary lesions in the lung.

    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Examples of viruses in the Poxvirus family are variola, vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum. All DNA viruses are icosahedral, except for Poxviruses, which are described as brick-shaped complexes. Poxvirus DNA is enveloped. All DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the nucleus, except for Poxvirus, which replicates in the cytoplasm via a virion-associated transcriptase. All of the enzymes and factors necessary for viral replication are then made in the cytoplasm. Adenoviruses (choice A) like the other DNA viruses (except Poxvirus), are icosahedral and have double-stranded linear DNA that replicates in the nucleus. The DNA is not enveloped and there is no virion-associated polymerase. The main example of the Hepadnavirus (choice B) family is the hepatitis B virus. It is icosahedral and contains partially double-stranded circular DNA that is enveloped. Viruses carry a DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity to synthesize an RNA intermediate that is then used to make genomic DNA. Herpesviruses (choice C) consist of herpes simplex, varicella zoster, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus. These are icosahedral and contain enveloped double-stranded linear DNA. The DNA replicates in the nucleus and the virus is assembled in the nucleus. Papillomaviruses (choice D) are icosahedral and contain naked double-stranded circular DNA that replicates in the nucleus.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has the signs and symptoms of a viral encephalitis. During the summer months, most types of viral encephalitis are transmitted by mosquitoes. Examples of arthropod-borne viruses include St. Louis virus, West Nile encephalitis virus (Flaviviridae), and Eastern equine, Western equine, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (Togaviridae). Herpes simplex encephalitis is actually the most common type of encephalitis in the United States, but it is transmitted by direct contact with infected tissues. If this had been a herpes simplex encephalitis, the lumbar puncture would have yielded a high opening pressure and multiple red blood cells would have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Aerosol (choice A) is the mechanism of transmission of most of the respiratory viruses. Fecal-oral transmission (choice C) is the most common means of infection with most gastroenteritis viruses. Most of these viruses are naked capsid viruses which are able to withstand passage through the acidity of the stomach. Parenteral transmission (choice D) is common among the enveloped viruses, which require direct transfusion or transplantation to cause disease. Sexual transmission (choice E) is common among the enveloped viruses, which are extremely fragile in the environment."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Despite the stress placed on the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex in discussions about HIV-infected patients, “ordinary” tuberculosis, caused by M. tuberculosis is the most prevalent form of mycobacterial infection at this point. M. avium-intracellulare complex infections usually do not predominate until the CD4 cell count has fallen well below 100/uL. It is also important to maintain a particularly high index of suspicion in AIDS patients, in whom the chest x-ray may be initially normal, possibly due to an impaired immune response. Some of these cases may clinically (and pathologically) resemble a more conventional bacterial pneumonia, because the body substitutes a comparatively ineffective neutrophil response for the granulomatous response it has trouble mounting. M. avium-intracellulare (choice A) are unusual mycobacterial infections that are noted for causing pulmonary and disseminated infections in AIDS patients, but they are less prevalent than M. tuberculosis except when the CD4+ count is less than 60/uL. M. leprae (choice B) causes leprosy. It is not an infection that is associated with HIV infection in the United States. M. marinum (choice C) can cause fish-tank granuloma (an ulcerating granuloma on the hands of tropical fish enthusiasts) when it enters through cuts in the skin in people who maintain home fish tanks. M. scrofulaceum (choice D) is a scotochromogen (produces carotenoid pigments in the dark) that causes solitary cervical lymphadenopathy in children exposed to contaminated water sources."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The photograph shows a stomach with a perforated peptic ulcer. Perforation of a peptic ulcer is potentially fatal, because of either peritonitis with sepsis or sudden exsanguination (if the perforation damages one of the many arteries of the stomach). Peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, possibly gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma have been strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori colonization of the mucus layer covering the gastric mucosa. The most important pathogenic attribute of H. pylori is its production of urease, which neutralizes the acidic pH of the stomach and allows the organism to invade the mucosal surface. The urease-positive organisms can be remembered with the mnemonic PUNCH: Proteus, Ureaplasma, Nocardia, Cryptococcus, Helicobacter. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with the urease breath test. Campylobacter jejuni (choice A) is also a gram-negative curved rod but is not associated with the formation of gastric ulcers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, anaerobic rod that is associated with gangrene and a mild form of food poisoning. Escherichia coli (choice C) is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod associated with many forms of gastroenteritis but not with gastric ulcer formation.

      "D. Positive-stranded RNA",
      "E. Segmented RNA"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Composite viruses are viruses that are created in laboratories by artificially combining components of different parental viruses. In this case, the genetic material is DNA because the molluscum contagiosum virus is a double-stranded DNA virus in the poxvirus family. Thus the progeny viruses will have a double-stranded DNA genome. Double-stranded RNA, segmented (choice B) would be the genome of reoviruses, and neither poxviruses nor poliovirus have this form of genome. Negative-stranded RNA viruses (choice C) is the genome of many viruses including rabies and orthomyxoviruses, but neither is present in this composite virus. Positive-stranded RNA viruses (choice D) is the genome of the polioviruses, but because the example uses only the poliovirus capsid, the poliovirus nucleic acid would not be present in target cells. Segmented RNA (choice E) is carried by Reoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Arenaviridae, but none of these genomes were included in this composite virus."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with AIDS develops a fever, headache, and a stiff neck. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 100 cells, which are mostly lymphocytes, glucose of 35 mg/dL, and protein of 75 mg/dL. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm this patient's diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. India ink",
      "B. Latex particle agglutination",
      "C. Molecular probe",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Tzanck smear"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has symptoms and signs of a fungal cerebrospinal infection. The most common cause of meningitis in AIDS patients in the United States is Cryptococcus neoformans, which is an encapsulated, monomorphic yeast acquired from exposure to pigeon droppings. Although the USMLE likes to mention the India ink test of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in vignettes to avoid having to give away the diagnosis, India ink is not the preferred diagnostic test. The more sensitive test that is used in most hospital situations is latex particle agglutination to detect capsular antigens shed into the CSF. India ink (choice A), a test to diagnose cryptococcal infections, depends on the precipitation of a particulate dye around the capsular material of the organism. It misses about 50% of all infections. Molecular probes (choice C) are used in many diagnoses, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a variety of virus infections. It is not used for cryptococcal meningitis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (choice D) is used to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in infants. This assay detects integrated HIV (provirus). PCRs are available for other virus infections but are not used to diagnose cryptococcosis. Tzanck smear (choice E) is used to diagnose herpesvirus infections. It involves touching a slide or coverslip to a lesion to lift off the multinucleated giant cells caused by the infection."

      "A. Clonorchis sinensis",
      "B. Fasciolopsis buski",
      "C. Paragonimus westermani",
      "D. Schistosoma haematobium",
      "E. Taenia saginata"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The stones described are pigment stones, composed of relatively pure calcium bilirubinate. These stones are less common than cholesterol stones. Risk factors for pigment stones include hepatic cirrhosis (unclear mechanism), hemolytic anemias, and liver fluke infection, notably by the Oriental liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Fasciolopsis buski (choice B) is a large intestinal fluke that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal mucosal abscesses. Fasciola spp., not Fasciolopsis, are other liver flukes besides Clonorchis. Paragonimus westermani (choice C) is a lung fluke that can cause cough, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis. Schistosoma haematobium (choice D) is a blood fluke that tends to infect pelvic veins and may cause bladder disease (including cancer). Taenia saginata (choice E) is the beef tapeworm, and may cause intestinal obstruction."

A peripheral blood smear shows severe anemia, and a bone-marrow aspirate shows no erythroid precursor cells. Infection with which of the following is most likely responsible for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Coxsackie virus",
      "B. Echovirus",
      "C. Hepadnavirus",
      "D. Herpesvirus",
      "E. Parvovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses, of which only serotype B19 is pathogenic for humans. This virus causes three distinct syndromes: a childhood febrile rash known as erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), aplastic crisis in individuals with chronic hemolytic diseases (sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia, etc.), and congenital infections that can present as stillbirth, hydrops fetalis (analogous to severe Rh incompatibility), or severe anemia. Coxsackie viruses (choice A) usually cause coldlike illness, but can cause herpangina, myocarditis, and meningitis. Echoviruses (choice B) can infect a variety of organ systems (gastrointestinal, central nervous system, eyes, heart, respiratory, skin), but are not a cause of aplastic crises. Hepadnavirus (choice C) is the causative agent of hepatitis B. Herpesviruses (choice D) cause a variety of acute to chronic infections, including herpes simplex types 1 and 2, chickenpox, chronic herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus infection, and Epstein-Barr virus infections."

    "question": "A stable clone of bacteria that is susceptible to tetracycline is placed in culture with 10 bacteria that are resistant to tetracycline. Within 24 hours, all the bacteria in the culture are tetracycline-resistant. The genetic process by which this occurred is shown Which of the following best describes this process?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Homologous recombination",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The diagram shows the process of conjugation between an F+ donor and an F- recipient bacterium. This process transfers plasmids in their entirety from the donor to the recipient. The traits that will be transferred in this way are those encoded in the plasmid and all recipients will become donors in the process. Generalized transduction (choice B) can be accomplished by both lytic and temperative phage only during the lytic cycle. The process involves the phage mistakenly packaging bacterial DNA into the capsid and transferring the DNA to another bacterial cell. In this type of transduction any gene can be transferred. Homologous recombination (choice C) is not a mechanism of genetic transfer for bacteria but a mechanism by which bacterial nucleic acid is stabilized following transfer. Transformation, transduction, and Hfr conjugation are all followed by homologous recombination requiring recombinase A. Specialized transduction (choice D) can only be accomplished by a temperate phage in which there is an excision error during induction of the phage from the bacterial chromosome. In this case, bacterial nucleic acid is mistakenly excised along with phage DNA. Only certain genes (located next to the phage insertion sites) have an opportunity to be transferred. Transformation (choice E) is the uptake of naked DNA by certain 'competent' bacterial cells."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman develops a dry cough, fever, headache, and muscular pains. She has been treated unsuccessfully for the past 1 week with aspirin and ampicillin. Three days later, she is brought to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath and worsening cough. An x-ray of the chest shows scattered interstitial opacities. Treatment with erythromycin is begun and her symptoms rapidly improve. Which of the following findings is most likely associated with the causal organism of patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cold agglutinins",
      "B. Dieterle silver staining",
      "C. Quellung reaction",
      "D. Requirement for cysteine",
      "E. Requirement for factors X and V"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient's clinical presentation is typical of primary atypical pneumonia. This type of pneumonia is typically caused by intracellular organisms such as viruses, or Chlamydiae, but since Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall, it does not elicit the characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate caused by most other bacteria. Because the patient's infection responded to erythromycin, it cannot have been caused by a virus; so the most likely causative agent is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A finding in about 65% of Mycoplasma patients is the production of cold agglutinins: IgM isohemagglutinins that will agglutinate autologous erythrocytes at 4°C (39.2°F). The Dieterle silver stain (choice B) is used to identify Legionella pneumophila, which is an agent of atypical pneumonia of the elderly but would be more likely in a smoker or immunosuppressed patient. Legionella would respond to erythromycin, but this patient is not immunocompromised. The Quellung reaction (choice C) is a technique used to identify the capsular serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium is the most common cause of adult typical pneumonia and would not cause the interstitial presentation described here. Requirement for cysteine (choice D) is a characteristic of four genera of bacteria: Francisella, Legionella, Brucella, and Pasteurella. Although Francisella, Legionella, and Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens that could cause atypical pneumonia, they would not be expected in this patient. Francisella is acquired from ticks or from handling infected reservoir animals. Brucella is acquired from contaminated dairy products or contact with animals. Legionella is a disease of elderly smokers who are immunosuppressed. Pasteurella is found in the mouths of many animals and is transmitted most commonly from cat bites. Requirement for factors X and V (choice E) is characteristic of Haemophilus. Haemophilus is an extracellular bacterium that causes otitis media, epiglottitis, pharyngitis and meningitis in unvaccinated children who are between 3 months and 2 years of age. It would not be expected in the present patient's age group."

    "options": [
      "A. 2-to-5-μm yeast with a thin cell wall but no true capsule",
      "B. 4-to-10-μm yeast with a broad, slimy capsule",

      "D. 20-to-50-μm nonbudding spherule filled with endospores",
      "E. Hyphae branching dichotomously at acute angles"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. A variety of fungi can produce acute or chronic lung disease like that described in this case history. They are distinguished by geographic incidence and examination of the sputum or biopsy. Histoplasma capsulatum which causes histoplasmosis, is observed most frequently in the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri river valleys of the United States (Central U.S.). The organism is a small (2-to-5-μm) intracellular yeast which, despite the name, has no true capsule. Calcifying lesions forming in the lungs are very suggestive of fungal infection. Blastomyces dermatitidis could cause similar presentation in this area, but it would be found in the sputum as a broad-based budding yeast, and that option is not available within the choices. Choice B describes Cryptococcus which is the most common cause of fungal meningitis in immunosuppressed patients notably those with AIDS or hematopoietic disorders. Choice C describes Paracoccidioides which can cause pulmonary disease in patients from South and Central America. Choice D describes Coccidioides, which can cause skin lesions or pulmonary disease in the desert southwest and far west of the United States (San Joaquin Valley fever). Choice E describes Aspergillus an opportunistic fungus that can invade cavitary lesions in the lung and cause aspergilloma, or fungus ball."

He says that he felt well until 4 days ago, but now has a headache and has been vomiting. His temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). Physical examination shows no rash, ulceration, or petechiae Laboratory studies show an absolute leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased serum transaminases. A peripheral blood smear shows granulocytes that contain berry-like clusters of intracellular organisms. The vector for the causative agent of his illness is the same as that for which of the following organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "B. Francisella tularensis",
      "C. Plasmodium vivax",
      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has granulocytic ehrlichiosis, caused by Ehrlichia phagocytophila. This intracellular bacterium is transmitted by the Ixodes tick, which also transmits Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. The disease presents similarly to Rocky Mountain spotted fever but does not have a rash. The pathognomonic feature in this case history is the presence of morulae (berry-like clusters of organisms) inside the patient's granulocytes. Francisella tularensis (choice B) can be transmitted in a number of different ways, but when an arthropod is implicated, it is the Dermacentor tick. This is the same tick that transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Tularemia is an ulceroglandular disease with fever, ulcer at the bite site, and lymph node enlargement. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of most of the encephalitis viruses, all species of malaria parasites, dengue yellow fever, and filariasis. This patient clearly does not have encephalitis, and malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and filariasis would not be expected in a 16-year-old boy in the continental United States. Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) is the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and is transmitted by the Dermacentor tick. Rocky Mountain spotted fever has a characteristic rash that begins on the ankles and wrists progressing toward the trunk. The Weil-Felix test, which is a nonspecific test for antibodies that agglutinate Proteus organisms, would be positive. This tick also transmits Francisella tularensis but the symptoms of this patient are not consistent with either tularemia (an ulceroglandular disease) or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (choice E) is the agent of scrub typhus. It is transmitted by mites in the genus Leptotrombidium. Rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari) is also transmitted in this fashion, but both of these diseases are rare in the United States and would be characterized by rash and Weil-Felix test positivity."

      "A. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci",
      "B. Gram-positive, catalase-negative diplococci",
      "C. Motile flagellated trophozoites",
      "D. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies",
      "E. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles",
      "F. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has acquired primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri. This organism is a free-living ameba that is found in warm freshwater lakes. During the act of diving into such lakes, changes in pressure can force the organism through the cribriform plate and result in the production of necrotic lesions spreading from the olfactory lobes. The form of the organism that is found in human tissue is a flagellated trophozoite. Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococci (choice A) describes Neisseria meningitidis. This is a common cause of meningitis in young adults, but the case history would have to describe the presence of petechial hemorrhages from endotoxin toxicity. N. meningitidis overproduces outer membrane fragments and thus produces very early signs of endotoxin shock compared to other gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive catalase-negative diplococci (choice B) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although this is the most common cause of typical pneumonia, meningitis and sinusitis in the United States, it is not associated with swimming or diving, and the CSF would have shown extremely high numbers of neutrophils, low glucose, and high protein. Multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice D) describes cells infected with herpes simplex virus. This is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. It is not associated with swimming or diving. Although the CSF cell, protein, and glucose values could have indicated a viral etiology, herpes simplex encephalitis is also associated with a high opening pressure and the presence of many red blood cells. Encephalitis is also generally associated with confusion or change in mental status. Ribbon-like hyphae branching at 90-degree angles (choice E) describes the zygomycophyta: bread mold fungi in the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, and Mucor. These agents can cause fatal rhinocerebral infections in ketoacidotic diabetics and adults with cancer. The symptoms would be quite similar to those described in this case history, but these are opportunistic pathogens that do not cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. Urease-positive, encapsulated yeasts (choice F) describes Cryptococcus neoformans. This monomorphic fungus is the principal cause of meningitis in patients with Hodgkin disease or AIDS."

Which of the following tests will be most helpful in confirming the identity of the most likely causal agent of his fever and respiratory symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. CD4 cell count",
      "B. Direct fluorescent antibody test",
      "C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay",
      "D. Polymerase chain reaction",
      "E. Western blot"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The most common atypical pneumonia in AIDS is caused by the atypical fungus Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii). Patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia have great difficulty producing sputum, so bronchial lavage or transmural biopsy are generally required. The sample is then submitted to the direct fluorescent antibody test or stained with Gomori methenamine silver stain to visualize the organisms. The direct fluorescent antibody test is a technique to demonstrate the presence of antigen from a pathogen in a patient. Antigen-detecting tests will remain useful throughout the life of an AIDS patient because they do not depend on detection of the patient's immune response to the pathogen (which may be absent at the end of AIDS). When stained with methenamine silver, Pneumocystis cysts have a characteristic cup or boat shape; the individual cells are difficult to demonstrate without electron microscopy. CD4 cell count (choice A) is used to measure the progression of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since the virus infects and destroys these cells, the number remaining in the circulation becomes a good predictor of the progression of disease. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (choice C) is used as the screening test to diagnose HIV infection. It is a serologic test (i.e., identifies antibodies against the virus) and once the patient progresses into full-blown AIDS, antibody levels other than IgM will decline, so in general, serologic tests in late HIV infection tend to be less useful than tests that detect antigens from a pathogen. Polymerase chain reaction (choice D) is used to detect the viral load of the HIV virus in infected patients and infants. Western blot (choice E) is the confirmatory serologic test that is used in the diagnosis of HIV infection."

      "A. Cell wall",
      "B. Cytoplasmic membrane",
      "C. Flagella",
      "D. Outer surface protein",
      "E. Periplasmic space"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This woman has developed a positive tuberculin skin test indicating exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The molecule injected into the skin of the forearm to elicit this response is a purified protein derivative (PPD), which is composed of tuberculin (an outer surface protein) and mycolic acids of the organism. This is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction requiring sensitized TH1 cells. Only proteins can evoke such responses, since T cells are only capable of recognizing peptides presented to them in the context of an MHC molecule. The cell wall (choice A) of mycobacteria contains a thinner-than-normal layer of peptidoglycan and mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids. However, this material is not proteinaceous and therefore does not stimulate the TH1 cells necessary for the formation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The cytoplasmic membrane (choice B) of mycobacteria is a phospholipid bilayer that is similar to the inner membranes of all other prokaryotes and does not contribute to the specific skin test for tuberculosis. Flagella (choice C) are not present on M. tuberculosis because the organism is not motile. M. tuberculosis does not possess a periplasmic space (choice E) because it is an organism that is taxonomically related to the gram-positives. Only gram-negative bacteria possess a periplasmic space."

      "D. Multiple sclerosis",
      "E. Rabies",
      "F. Syphilis",
      "G. Tuberculosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rapidly progressive demyelinating disorder in which the JC virus (a polyomavirus) infects oligodendroglial cells in the brain. The eosinophilic inclusions represent accumulations of JC virus. PML occurs in about 1% of AIDS patients, and is the AIDS-defining illness in half of the patients who develop the condition. Symptoms include aphasia, hemiparesis, cortical blindness, ataxia, and conjugate gaze abnormalities. The condition can progress to quadriparesis and coma. There is no effective treatment for this disorder. Shingles and postinfectious encephalitis can follow chickenpox (choice B) but varicella is not specifically associated with demyelination. Measles (choice C) can cause an encephalitis and, in some cases, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) may follow previous measles infection. These disorders would affect not only white matter but gray matter as well. Also, SSPE usually occurs before the age of 18. Multiple sclerosis (choice D) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease characterized by demyelination. The immunologic basis of the pathology appears to be that TH1 lymphocytes reactive against myelin stimulate macrophages to destroy the myelin. It is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity response. Women are affected twice as often as men. The disease tends to have a relapsing and remitting course and may involve visual impairment, cranial nerve signs, ataxia, nystagmus, and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Spinal cord lesions give rise to motor and sensory difficulties of the trunk and limbs, and spasticity and loss of control of bladder function. Rabies (choice E) produces eosinophilic inclusions (Negri bodies) in the brain but these are found in the gray matter. Signs of rabies would include excessive salivation, hallucinations, and hydrophobia. Syphilis (choice F) can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord damage, but the disease process would not be limited to the white matter. Tuberculosis (choice G) can cause a granulomatous meningitis, typically affecting the base of the brain."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The patient is suffering from conjunctivitis caused by Haemophilus, a fastidious organism requiring factors V (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and X (hematin), which must be released from whole-blood preparations to be accessible to the organism. This can be done by gentle heating, which lyses the red blood cells, or by co-culture with Staphylococcus aureus, which is beta-hemolytic and lyses the red blood cells to provide the factors Haemophilus needs for growth. This is called the satellite phenomenon. Antibiotics (choice A) would not be necessary since, with proper culture techniques, no normal flora should be available to confuse the diagnosis of conjunctivitis. Antibiotics and antifungals are added to chocolate agar to create Thayer-Martin medium to prevent the growth of normal flora when culturing from the genital tract. Cold temperature (choice B) would not be necessary because Haemophilus grows at normal body temperature. Listeria is the genus commonly mentioned for which a cold temperature is necessary. Cholesterol (choice C) is necessary for the growth of Mycoplasma but not Haemophilus. Low oxygen tension (choice D) is necessary for the growth of the microaerophiles (such as Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Borrelia), but is not a condition for growth of Haemophilus."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This woman has developed a pulmonary abscess, as evidenced by the chest radiograph. Of the organisms listed, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely cause of bacterial pneumonia complicated by abscess formation. Bacteria that commonly produce pneumonia that develops in the context of influenza include Staph. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of these, Staph. aureus is most destructive to lung tissue and likely to cause cavitary lesions. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus (choice A) describes Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium would be a cause of pneumonia in alcoholic or diabetic patients, or in those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A gram-positive catalase-negative alpha-hemolytic diplococcus (choice B) describes Strep. pneumoniae. This agent causes a necrotizing abscessing pneumonia with appearance similar to that of Staph. aureus, but it rarely causes cavitary lesions. A silver-staining cyst (choice D) describes Pneumocystis jiroveci. This agent is associated with atypical pneumonia in the immunocompromised or in premature infants.

Chickenpox may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, systemic spread (immunosuppressed patients), neurologic involvement (rare), Reye syndrome (rare), and/or hemolytic anemia (rare). Genital vesicles and ulcers (choice A) are associated with herpes simplex type 2. Infectious mononucleosis (choice B) is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Orchitis (choice C) can complicate mumps infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (choice E) is a rare complication of measles infection."

    "question": "An 18-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of fever, chills, and sore throat. Physical examination shows marked pharyngeal hyperemia, tonsillar exudates, cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Treatment with ampicillin is begun. Two weeks later, he returns to the physician because of a generalized maculopapular rash. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chest x-ray",
      "B. ELISA",
      "C. Heterophile antibody test",
      "D. Lateral x-ray of the neck",
      "E. Rapid antigen test",
      "F. Varicella virus indirect immunofluorescence"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient most likely has infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The clinical features include sore throat, headache, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, hepatosplenomegaly, periorbital edema, rash, and a palatal enanthem. The diagnosis is made by heterophile antibody testing (monospot), EBV antibody titers, and the finding of lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. Treatment includes rest, fluids, and analgesics. Treatment with penicillin derivatives (ampicillin) leads to a maculopapular rash. Chest x-ray (choice A) is useful for a respiratory or cardiac process. Infectious mononucleosis cannot be diagnosed by any radiographic study. ELISA (choice B) would be a useful screening test for a variety of infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A lateral x-ray of the neck (choice D) is useful in acute epiglottitis; it would show epiglottic swelling. The symptoms of epiglottitis include extreme sore throat, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. A rapid antigen test (choice E) is used to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is characterized by fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. A scarlatiniform rash may follow the pharyngitis. The rash, a diffuse erythema that later desquamates, is caused by an erythrotoxin. Antibodies to the varicella virus (choice F) can be detected by immunofluorescence. The symptoms of varicella include a vesicular rash (in various stages of evolution), fever, and malaise. The treatment is bathing soaks and antipruritic topical medication. Treatment with aspirin has been associated with Reye syndrome and should therefore be avoided."

    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a fever, nausea, diarrhea, and a rash. Her last menstrual period began 3 days ago. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a diffuse erythematous rash with areas of desquamation over the hands and feet. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",

      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus",
      "E. Single-stranded diploid RNA virus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a multisystem syndrome caused by a toxin (TSST-1) formed by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. TSS usually affects several organ systems (gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary) and can result in death. TSS has historically been associated with the use of tampons in young women, but can also occur in other patient populations. Fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and diffuse rash with desquamation of the hands and feet are common symptoms. Management of shock, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a priority if these conditions are present, in addition to appropriate antibacterial treatment. S. aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus. A gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting, nonmotile, non-H₂S-producing bacillus (choice A) describes the genus Shigella, which causes dysentery, characterized by fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea. A gram-positive anaerobic rod (choice B) describes Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene with necrosis of soft tissues, usually after a traumatic wound. It is also a cause of food poisoning. Gram-positive, catalase-positive, novobiocin-sensitive coccus (choice D) describes Staph. epidermidis, which is part of the normal skin flora but is notorious for causing infections of intravenous lines and prosthetic heart valves. A single-stranded diploid RNA virus (choice E) describes the retroviruses. Although HIV-1 can cause many diverse findings and should never be immediately ruled out, the findings in the present patient are most specific for TSS."

      "D. Plague",
      "E. Poliovirus",
      "F. Rabies",
      "G. Tularemia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, first reported in 1993, consists of fever, myalgia, and rapid development of respiratory failure leading to death. The initial cases were mostly among Navajo Indians, however, cases have been documented in many U.S. states and in Canada. It is most common in the U.S. Four Corners states: New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. The causative agent is a hantavirus belonging to the family Bunyaviridae. The virus has also been called the Sin Nombre (Spanish for 'without a name') virus. Infection is thought to be through inhalation of aerosolized secretions from the common deer mouse. The disease typically begins with a nonspecific prodrome (fever, generalized myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances) followed 4 to 5 days later by respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea). This progresses rapidly to an adult respiratory distress syndrome and, in many cases, death. California encephalitis (choice A) is caused by an arbovirus transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Most cases are in children younger than 10 years of age. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Myalgias and arthralgias are typically present. Seizure activity is most frequently observed in infants and young children. Most cases are in the midwestern United States. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (choice B) is a Herpesvirus that produces a variety of infections. Primary CMV infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients, but can cause a heterophile-negative mononucleosis syndrome. Perinatal infections can occur in utero, intrapartum, or postpartum, and can produce congenital malformations. CMV can be transmitted by leukocytes in blood transfusions. In patients with AIDS or other immunosuppressive states, CMV can produce severe disease, including retinitis, pneumonia, encephalitis, adrenalitis, and gastrointestinal tract ulcerations. Plague (choice D) is caused by Yersinia pestis. It is endemic in the desert southwest of the United States, but plague normally begins with an extremely high fever, conjunctivitis, and septicemia. If it is acquired by fleabite, then buboes (hemorrhagic lymph nodes) will be found; if it is acquired in the pneumonic form, then cough will be observed. Poliovirus (choice E) is a member of the Picornavirus family. It remains epidemic in parts of Asia and Africa even though the wild type has been eliminated from the western hemisphere. The virus affects cranial nerve nuclei and anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, producing a flaccid paralysis that is usually asymmetric. Vaccine-related polio can occur with the live virus vaccine. Rabies (choice F) is a Rhabdovirus that produces encephalitis and/or myelitis. It should be considered in persons who have recently traveled outside of the United States. The most common sources of exposure are dogs, cats, skunks, foxes, raccoons (in Florida and Connecticut), wolves, and bats. The infection is acquired from the bite of a rabid animal or by inhalation. Rabies also has been reported to occur in patients after corneal transplantation. The virus spreads along peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. Symptoms include hallucinations, hydrophobia and copious salivation. Tularemia (choice G) is caused by Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative, cysteine-requiring facultative intracellular bacillus. The disease is most common in Arkansas and Missouri, and is acquired by handling, ingesting, or inhaling material from infected reservoir animals such as deer, rabbits and small rodents. It may also be transmitted by ticks from one of the reservoir animals to humans. Tularemia is generally characterized by disseminated granulomatous lesions, and would not be expected to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome."

    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of a headache and a high fever. He recently returned from a 2-week trip to Europe where he went diving in several natural pools. A diagnosis of meningoencephalitis localized to the base of his brain is made. A photomicrograph of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is shown. Through which of the following structures did the causal organism most likely gain access to the brain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cavernous sinus",
      "B. Cribriform plate",
      "C. Lacrimal bone",
      "D. Mandible",
      "E. Nasal bone",
      "F. Zygomatic bone"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The rare but life-threatening meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri apparently ensues when the organism enters the body through the nasal mucosa and crosses the cribriform plate to enter the brain via the olfactory nerves. It has been speculated that changes in pressure created during diving predispose to this infection. The cavernous sinus (choice A) is the site of entry of the zygomycophyta (Rhizopus, Mucor or Absidia) into the brain in diabetic ketoacidotic patients or adults with cancer. The lacrimal bone (choice C) of the medial aspect of the orbit does not appear to be involved in amebic infection. The mouth and its associated bones, including the mandible (choice D), do not appear to be routes of infection for this organism. The nasal bones (choice E) located on the superior surface of the nose, do not appear to be a route of infection for this organism. The zygomatic bone (choice F) which forms the cheekbone, does not appear to be a route of infection for this organism."

Serology for hepatitis viruses is performed and shows the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM antibody Antibody tests for HBsAb and HAV are negative. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these results?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute HBV infection",
      "B. A dual infection of HBV and HAV",
      "C. Chronic hepatitis B infection",
      "D. Immunity to hepatitis B virus",
      "E. Past hepatitis A infection"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) along with hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM Ab), and the absence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), indicate the early stages of an acute infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). A dual infection of HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) (choice B) is not plausible since the IgM anti-HAV serology is negative. Chronic HBV infection (choice C) is unlikely because the patient has HBc IgM Ab, which is characteristic of an acute infection rather than a chronic infection. Immunity to HBV (choice D) is not plausible due to the presence of HBsAg and HBc IgM Ab and the lack of HBsAb. Past hepatitis A infection (choice E) would be manifested by the presence of IgG antibodies against HAV."

      "C. Rheumatic fever",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has acute infective endocarditis. The most common cause of acute bacterial endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus. This type of endocarditis is typically acquired by illicit intravenous drug use, which can introduce skin organisms into the venous system that then attack the tricuspid valve. Staph. aureus accounts for between 60 and 90% of cases of endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Damage to the tricuspid valve is common. The endocarditis associated with congenital heart disease (choice B) typically involves either damaged valves or atrial or ventricular septal defects. The tricuspid valve is not particularly vulnerable. Rheumatic fever (choice C) most commonly damages the mitral and aortic valves, and tricuspid damage is usually less severe and seen only when the mitral and aortic valves are heavily involved. Rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) is not associated with bacterial endocarditis. Systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) can produce small, aseptic vegetations on the ventricular and atrial surfaces of the mitral valve (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)."

      "C. Non-pilus adhesins",
      "D. Pili",
      "E. Pneumolysin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common causes of otitis media in children are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In a vignette that gives no Gram stain or culture characteristics, the answer should refer to the number one cause, in this case Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most important virulence factor in Strep. pneumoniae is the capsule, which protects against phagocytosis. Lipopolysaccharide (choice B) is present in all gram-negative bacteria and would not be found in Strep. pneumoniae which is gram-positive. Non-pilus adhesins (choice C) exist in many organisms, and mediate adherence to the epithelial surfaces. For example, hemagglutinin molecules of bacteria and viruses fit this definition, and some toxins like the pertussis toxin have adhesive abilities. Pili (choice D) are glycoprotein “hairs” which mediate attachment to the epithelium. In gram-positives such as this one they are referred to as fimbriae and in gram-negatives they are extremely important virulence factors in allowing colonization of the uroepithelium by Escherichia coli, for example. Pneumolysin (choice E) is a cytotoxin produced by Strep. pneumoniae which destroys ciliated epithelial cells."

      "A. Flea",
      "B. Louse",
      "C. Mosquito",
      "D. Reduviid bug",
      "E. Tick"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The patient has myocarditis due to Trypanosoma cruzi. This infectious condition, known as Chagas disease, is endemic in vast areas of South America and is transmitted from person to person by the reduviid bug, also known as the 'kissing bug'. Experts assess the number of persons with Chagas disease at about 7 million, with about 35 million at risk in South America. T. cruzi is an intracellular protozoan that localizes mainly in the heart and nerve cells of the myenteric plexus, leading to myocarditis and dysmotility of hollow organs, such as the esophagus, colon, and ureter. Cardiac involvement manifests with ventricular dilatation and congestive heart failure secondary to myocyte necrosis and fibrosis. Intracellular parasites can be visualized in tissue sections. Chagas disease is a cause of acquired achalasia, in which the distal third of the esophagus dilates because of loss of its intrinsic innervation. A similar pathologic mechanism accounts for megacolon and megaureter in Chagas disease. The flea (choice A) is the vector for Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. The louse (choice B) is the vector for Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus. The mosquito (choice C) is the vector for many of the Arboviruses that cause encephalitis. West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis are examples. Ticks (choice E) are the vectors for Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia, Rickettsia rickettsii, for example."

    "question": "A strain of Escherichia coli is resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, ampicillin, kanamycin, and neomycin Another strain of the same bacteria is not resistant to any of these drugs. When 100 bacteria from the resistant strain are added to a flask of bacteria of the sensitive strain and incubated overnight, all the bacteria in the flask develop resistance to the full complement of antibiotics Which of the following best explains these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation",
      "B. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction",
      "C. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction",
      "D. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation",
      "E. Transfer of multiple drug-resistance plasmids via conjugation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli are well known for their ability to transfer multiple-drug resistances during a single conjugative event. When these resistance genes become accumulated on a plasmid capable of mediating conjugation (a fertility factor), all drug-resistance genes are transferred efficiently and swiftly to the other partner of conjugation. Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. Transfer of drug resistance from the Hfr chromosome during conjugation (choice A) would not be likely to have the same level of efficiency as that described in the question stem. Although the Hfr cell transfers some DNA via conjugation, it transfers chromosomal DNA, not plasmid DNA. Because the chromosome is so much larger, the exchange is never complete, and only some genes can be successfully transferred in each conjugative event. Because all the sensitive bacteria in this experiment acquired all the drug-resistance genes, it is unlikely that these were all chromosomal genes. Transfer of drug resistance via generalized transduction (choice B) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Generalized transduction is the mechanism by which a lytic phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via specialized transduction (choice C) would require the presence of bacterial viruses in the cultures, but these are not mentioned. Specialized transduction is the mechanism by which a temperate phage can accidentally transfer bacterial DNA from cell to cell if there is an error of excision. Transfer of drug resistance via transformation (choice D) requires the uptake of free DNA from the environment by competent cells. It is not likely that such a large amount of DNA could be transferred in this way with 100% efficiency."

    "question": "Several hours after eating custard pastries, several patrons at a bakery develop nausea and vomiting. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacillus cereus",
      "B. Clostridium perfringens",
      "C. Escherichia coli",
      "D. Shigella sonnei",
      "E. Staphylococcus aureus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxin A, which is the likely contaminant that was present in the pastries. When ingested, the toxin causes severe nausea and vomiting within a few hours (average incubation time: 3-6 hours). There is little diarrhea associated with this type of food-poisoning outbreak. Bacillus cereus (choice A) is a gram-positive, spore-forming rod that is associated with food-poisoning outbreaks following the ingestion of rice served in buffet-style restaurants. The time of onset and the symptoms would mimic staphylococcal disease; the major differentiating feature is the food involved. This organism survives the boiling of the rice because it is a spore-former. It germinates as the rice cools, then it grows and elaborates an enterotoxin. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe that can cause a longer incubation (8-to-24-hour) food poisoning, typically with marked diarrhea. Once again, the spores allow the organism to survive the heating process used in the preparation of the food. C. perfringens is associated with re-heated meat dishes. The symptoms of Escherichia coli (choice C) food poisoning are usually watery diarrhea (traveler's diarrhea) with minimal nausea and vomiting, or a bloody diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive strains of the agent. Shigella sonnei (choice D) causes enterocolitis characterized by fever cramps, and diarrhea after an incubation period of 1 to 4 days. Transmission is fecal-oral, associated with poor hygiene. A wide range of foods has been implicated."

      "F. Pleomorphic gram-negative rods in parallel short chains",
      "G. Spirochetes visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. This is a typical case description of chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, a pleomorphic, gram-negative rod that displays a characteristic pattern ('school of fish') on Gram-stained slides. It grows on chocolate agar or on whole blood agar with a satellite phenomenon (around Staphylococcus aureus). Treat with azithromycin or ceftriaxone. Encapsulated bacteria inside mononuclear cells (choice A) describes Klebsiella granulomatis, the agent of granuloma inguinale. This disease is rare in the United States and would be expected most commonly in the tropics of Africa. It is generally a painless genital or perianal lesion that begins as a beefy-red bump and then breaks into granulation tissue that bleeds easily. Epithelial cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies (choice B) are found with herpes simplex infections but these lesions would be vesicular and painful. Iodine-staining intracellular inclusion bodies (choice C) would be found during infections with Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of lymphogranuloma venereum, but this lesion is generally nonpainful. It is associated with lymphadenopathy and genital elephantiasis. Koilocytotic squamous epithelial cells (choice D) are found in infections with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is associated with genital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and penile cancer. Neutrophils containing gram-negative diplococci (choice E) would be found if this were gonorrhea. However, in gonorrhea, the patient would have a leukorrheic urethral discharge, and not the ulcerative genital lesion described here. Spirochetes (choice G) would be found on darkfield microscopy if this were a case of syphilitic chancre but that chancre would be hard and nontender."

      "C. The child has been exposed to a grandparent with shingles",
      "D. The rash is a normal side effect of the MMR",
      "E. The vaccine was contaminated with live virus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The rash shown in the image is clearly unilateral and follows a dermatome, which is diagnostic of the rash of shingles, the second manifestation of infection with the varicella zoster virus. After the initial episode of chickenpox (primary infection), the varicella zoster virus develops a latent infection in the sensory ganglia. If the latent virus is reactivated, shingles develops. The majority of cases of chickenpox present in children, who will show an asynchronous pruritic rash consisting of papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusted lesions in crops in various stages. Shingles mainly presents in the elderly population as unilateral painful vesicles restricted to one dermatome. When shingles occurs in young children such as this one, it is typically due to the fact that the initial exposure to varicella zoster happened during a period of time when the child was passively protected by maternal antibodies acquired across the placenta or in breast milk. Because the child does not develop a robust active response to this infection, reactivational disease tends to onset at earlier than the normal age. Exposure of a 'naive' individual to chickenpox (choice B) or to shingles (choice C) would result in a case of chickenpox, which has different symptomatology from that described. The MMR is an attenuated live virus vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella. Adverse reactions to the MMR include fever, arthralgia and rash, but the rash shown here is clearly shingles, which is caused by varicella zoster virus (choice D). Contamination with live virus (choice E) is not a possibility because any contamination of the MMR vaccine with varicella zoster virus would have resulted in a case of chickenpox, not shingles."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A,B, Ba and C) causes a conjunctival and corneal infection that is spread in developing countries by eye-seeking flies and hand-to-eye contact. The lesions begin with formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva. With disease progression, there is tissue necrosis, granulation tissue deposition, and scar formation, leading to lacrimal duct obstruction and distortion of the eyelids. The organism is an obligate intracellular parasite spread from human to human in a metabolically inactive, extracellular form called an elementary body. The form that would be grown in tissue culture cells is the reticulate body. Elementary bodies (choice A) are the infectious form but are metabolically inactive and cannot be cultured. Gram-negative diplococcus (choice B) describes Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can cause ophthalmia neonatorum but would not cause pannus formation and scarring. Gram-positive coccus (choice C) could describe Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause conjunctivitis but not pannus formation and scarring.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has floppy-baby syndrome, caused by ingestion of the spores of Clostridium botulinum, germination of the organism in the gut of the infant, and subsequent production of the botulinum toxin, which causes a flaccid paralysis by blocking release of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The genetic coding for production of this neurotoxin is found in the genome of a lysogenic phage, and therefore is produced only in virus-infected bacterial cells. Other medically important attributes that are encoded in this way include the cholera toxin, Shiga toxin, O antigen of Salmonella, the erythrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes, and the diphtheria toxin. The bacterial chromosome (choice A) is the location of all essential genes in the bacterium. Loss of any essential gene will result in the death of the organism. Although most exotoxins are encoded on bacterial plasmids, endotoxin production is chromosomally encoded. An episome (choice B) is a plasmid that has become stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome. This is the mechanism by which Hfr cells arise in nature but is not known to play a role in exotoxin production in bacteria. Plasmids (choice D) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that replicate autonomously and carry genes for most exotoxins, fertility factors, and most antibiotic resistances. The botulinum toxin, the erythrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes and the diphtheria toxin are not encoded on plasmids but in the genomes of lysogenic phages. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are capable of mediating their own movement within and between strands of DNA inside cells. Transposition is believed to be responsible for the arising of multiple-drug resistance plasmids but is not believed to play a role in exotoxin production."

    "question": "A newborn has a severe viral infection with involvement of the heart, liver, and brain. The illness resolves several weeks later. A viral culture of the throat is most likely to grow an organism that contains which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Double-stranded DNA",
      "B. Double-stranded RNA",
      "C. Single-stranded DNA",
      "D. single-stranded negative-sense RNA",
      "E. Single-stranded, positive-sense RNA"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common viral disease of children caused primarily by coxsackie virus. In infants, coxsackie A can cause disseminated disease involving multiple organs, but unlike cytomegalovirus (the most common cause of disseminated fetal infections in the U.S.), coxsackie virus infections will typically resolve without sequelae. The coxsackie viruses (as well as poliovirus, echoviruses, and rhinoviruses) are Picornaviruses that are composed of single-stranded linear positive-sense RNA. The virus particles are non-enveloped, 27-nm icosahedrons with 60 subunits that replicate in the cytoplasm. The mnemonic for remembering the Picornaviruses is 'PEECoRNA viruses': Polio, Entero, Echo, Coxsackie, Rhino, hep A. The mnemonic for remembering the positive-sense RNA viruses is 'Call Henry, Pico and Flo To Come Right away': Calicivirus, Hepevirus, Picornavirus, Flavivirus, Togavirus, Coronavirus, Retrovirus. Poxviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses have double-stranded DNA (choice A). Of these, molluscum contagiosum (poxvirus) causes umbilicated warts; herpes 6 causes roseola infantum, which is a mild febrile disease followed by a rash; and adenoviruses cause conjunctivitis, pharyngoconjunctivitis, upper respiratory disease, and gastroenteritis. None of these would be compatible with the stem in this case. Reoviruses have double-stranded RNA (choice B) and include rotaviruses which cause prolonged, watery diarrhea in infants. Parvoviruses have single-stranded DNA (choice C) and include B19 virus, the cause of erythema infectiosum (slapped cheek disease) in school age children. Orthomyxoviruses have single-stranded, negative-sense RNA (choice D) and include influenza virus, which causes fever, myalgia, cough, and malaise."

      "C. A gram-negative, pleomorphic bacillus requiring factors X and V",
      "D. A gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus",
      "E. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This man has pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae as suggested by his alcoholism, lobar consolidation, and 'currant jelly' sputum. Klebsiella is a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae, so it is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacillus. A gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus (choice B) describes Pseudomonas aeruginosa which may cause pneumonia but would be more likely in a patient with cystic fibrosis than in an alcoholic. The sputum would have a blue-green color and a fruity odor. A gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus requiring factors X and V (choice C) describes Haemophilus influenzae. It is a cause of pneumonia, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and otitis media, but does not typically cause lobar consolidation or bloody sputum. A gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus (choice D) describes the genus Streptococcus, of which S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in adults (including alcoholics). The sputum of streptococcal pneumonia, however is 'rusty' or tinged with brown blood, not bright red and gelatinous as described here. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus (choice E) describes the genus Staphylococcus, of which S. aureus is a common cause of pneumonia. It is most commonly associated with aspiration pneumonia in alcoholics but causes a salmon-colored sputum, not one that is bright red and gelatinous."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man comes to the physician because of chronic, symmetric arthritis of the knees. He developed an extensive rash after a deer-hunting trip several years ago. He says that he felt 'sick' at that time, and developed knee pain that prevented him from climbing stairs for several months, but the pain has partially resolved. Which of the following is likely to be part of this patient's past medical history?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aplastic crisis",
      "B. Bell palsy",
      "C. Erythema nodosum",
      "D. Pharyngitis",
      "E. Urethral discharge"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This history is characteristic for Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The clues are deer, rash, knees, and acute arthritis followed by chronic arthritis. The first sign of disease is typically a migrating red rash in the shape of concentric rings (erythema migrans), and this stage is frequently followed by neurologic symptoms such as Bell palsy. This may be followed by signs of cardiac arrhythmia or pericarditis, and finally by arthritis and arthralgias, which are believed to be immune complex-mediated. Aplastic crisis (choice A) is caused by parvovirus B19 in patients with sickle-cell anemia. It is not associated with Lyme disease. Erythema nodosum (choice C) or desert bumps, are caused by Coccidioides immitis in the desert of the U.S. Southwest. These symptoms are not associated with Lyme disease. Pharyngitis (choice D) is not a common finding in Lyme disease, although other influenza-like symptoms may occur, such as fever, chills, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and musculoskeletal pain. Urethral discharge (choice E) would not be expected with Lyme disease, but if you thought the arthritis was caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, this answer would have been appropriate."

    "options": [
      "A. Cowdry type A inclusions",
      "B. Guarnieri bodies",
      "C. Koilocytes",
      "D. Negri bodies",
      "E. Owl's-eye inclusions"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV causes infected cells to have an enlarged nucleus and perinuclear vacuolization. These cells are called koilocytic cells, which are diagnostic for HPV. Cowdry type A inclusions (choice A) are diagnostic for herpesviruses. Herpes simplex virus causes vesicular lesions. Guarnieri bodies (choice B) are intracytoplasmic inclusions diagnostic for poxviruses. Of these, molluscum contagiosum can produce genital warts, but these warts are friable and umbilicated and would not have the fibrous stroma described here. Negri bodies (choice D) are diagnostic for rabies virus. They are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions in neurons, and would not be associated with warts. Owl's-eye inclusions (choice E) are basophilic intranuclear inclusions with clearing around them that are diagnostic for cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus is not associated with warts."

Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the mass shows multiple tiny oval forms within macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Blastomycosis",
      "B. Coccidioidomycosis",
      "C. Histoplasmosis",
      "D. Paracoccidioidomycosis",
      "E. Sporotrichosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Histoplasmosis is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus that grows as a mold in the wild but as a tiny yeast inside macrophages in humans. The disease is typically asymptomatic or mild enough to go undetected, but when symptomatic it presents with cough, fever, and malaise. It is commonly seen in geographic areas surrounding the central riverbeds of the United States. The primary and secondary treatments of choice for uncomplicated histoplasmosis are itraconazole and fluconazole, respectively. More serious cases are treated with amphotericin B. Blastomycosis (choice A) is characterized by a larger, round, budding yeast form, seen free in the tissues. Coccidioidomycosis (choice B) is seen mainly in the desert parts of the southwestern United States. In the lungs, spherules containing endospores are seen. Paracoccidioidomycosis (choice D) is endemic in Latin America, especially in Brazil. The infected cells show a typical 'pilot's wheel' appearance due to multiple yeasts sprouting out of a single parent cell. Sporotrichosis (choice E) most often produces a localized cutaneous infection, following inoculation occurring in association with minor skin trauma during gardening."

    "question": "A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of multiple blister-like lesions on the glans of the penis. He has had 2 episodes of similar symptoms during the past 2 years. Physical examination shows tender, 3-to-4-mm vesicles on the shaft of the penis with no crusting, drainage, or bleeding There is also mild bilateral inguinal adenopathy Which of the following best describes the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. The agent becomes latent in B cells",
      "B. The agent becomes latent in mononuclear cells",
      "C. The agent becomes latent in the dorsal root ganglia",
      "D. The agent becomes latent in the sacral ganglia",
      "E. The agent becomes latent in trigeminal ganglia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is a classic example of an infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV, probably type 2). This agent causes lytic infections in mucoepithelial cells. It then moves by retrograde transport into neurons of the sacral ganglia, where it lies dormant during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. The Tzanck smear is a diagnostic test involving the touching of a microscope slide to a vesicular lesion. Multinucleated giant cells will be lifted off onto the slide and can be stained and identified as having a herpesvirus origin. B cells (choice A) are the site of latency for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Mononuclear cells (choice B) are the site of latency for cytomegalovirus (CMV). The dorsal root ganglia (choice C) are the sites of latency for varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles. Since the present lesions are on the genitalia, the virus would move into latency in the sacral ganglia, not the trigeminal ganglia (choice E). HSV introduced into the oral mucosa becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglia."

    "question": "An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of crampy abdominal pain, nausea, and mild diarrhea for the past 2 weeks. Her mother states that the girl vomited a 10-cm (4-inch) long cylindrical white worm 24 hours ago. Which of the following best describes the most likely route of infection in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Autoinfection",
      "B. Ingestion of cysts in contaminated water",
      "C. Ingestion of eggs from an infected pet",
      "D. Ingestion of eggs from human feces",
      "E. Mosquito transmission of larvae",
      "F. Skin penetration of larvae"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is a case of Ascaris lumbricoides infection, the only helminth infection caused by a cylindrical white worm of this remarkably large size. It is acquired directly with no intermediate host, from fecal contamination from other human beings, and the stage of the life cycle that is transmitted is the egg. Autoinfection (choice A) is a rare occurrence in helminthic infections, possible only with Strongyloides stercoralis (the threadworm), Enterobius vermicularis (the pinworm), and Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm). Ingestion of cysts in contaminated water (choice B) is the normal mechanism of infection used by intestinal protozoa. There are no helminthic infections in the United States that are transmitted via cysts in water. Ingestion of eggs from an infected pet (choice C) occurs in visceral larva migrans when the ascarids of dogs and cats infect the human, an aberrant host. It would never result in the introduction of an adult worm into the vomitus, as described here. Mosquito transmission of larvae (choice E) is a means of transmission of the filarial nematodes, none of which are found in the United States and none of which would be found in vomitus. Skin penetration of larvae (choice F) is the mechanism of infection used by hookworms, threadworms, and schistosomes. None of these helminths would fit the description of the worm that was recovered in this case, since none of these is larger than 1 cm in length."

A peripheral blood smear shows Schüffner dots in enlarged erythrocytes containing oval bodies. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Babesia microti",
      "B. Plasmodium falciparum",
      "C. Plasmodium malariae",
      "D. Plasmodium ovale",
      "E. Plasmodium vivax"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The description of Schüffner dots tells us this patient is infected with Plasmodium vivax or ovale malaria. Schüffner dots are morphologic changes that occur in infected host erythrocytes, are visible by light microscopy in Romanovsky-stained blood smears, and appear as multiple brick-red dots. Both P. vivax and P. ovale (choice D) are capable of causing relapse following recovery from the primary infection. Both organisms leave dormant forms in the liver, called hypnozoites. Of these two, however, only P. vivax occurs in the western hemisphere. P. falciparum and P. malariae (choices B and C) do not possess these dormant forms and thus are incapable of causing relapses, but if drug treatment of the erythrocytic stages is inadequate the symptoms can 'recrudesce' due to renewed multiplication in the bloodstream. Relapses and recrudescences look the same symptomatically, because once parasites begin multiplying again in the bloodstream, the cyclic fevers return. Babesia microti (choice A) causes malaria-like symptoms and is transmitted by the same tick that spreads Lyme disease. It does not occur in Panama."

    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus",
      "B. Diphtheria toxin",
      "C. Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
      "D. Labile toxin of Escherichia coli",
      "E. Pertussis toxin",
      "F. Verotoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae. The voluminous 'rice-water' stools described in the question result from the action of the cholera enterotoxin. Cholera enterotoxin acts by activating adenylate cyclase by ADP ribosylation of a GTP-binding protein in small intestinal crypt cells, turning on massive secretion of isotonic fluid. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli produce a toxin very similar to cholera toxin, the heat-labile toxin. The alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus (choice A) is a pore-forming toxin that punches holes in cellular membranes. Diphtheria toxin (choice B) acts by ribosylating eukaryotic elongation factor-2 and thereby inhibiting eukaryotic protein synthesis. Its binding component targets heart, nerve, and epithelial cells. Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (choice C) acts very similarly to the diphtheria toxin, inhibiting elongation factor-2, but targeting liver cells. Pertussis toxin (choice E) causes edema by ADP-ribosylating Gi, the inhibitory subunit of G protein, thus increasing cyclic AMP. Verotoxin (choice F) is produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and acts in a mechanism similar to that of the Shiga toxin, shutting down eukaryotic protein synthesis by clipping the 60S ribosomal subunit."

Which of the following is the most important pathogenic property of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Biofilm production",
      "B. Endotoxin production",
      "C. Intracellular habitat",
      "D. Novobiocin resistance",
      "E. Superantigen action"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common cause of infections involving catheters and prosthetic devices is Staphylococcus epidermidis. Materials left in the body for prolonged periods of time are almost always coated with Teflon™, which is so slippery that most organisms cannot adhere and cause infections there. S. epidermidis is capable of initiating infection even on Teflon-coated surfaces because it produces a biofilm that alters the surface tension of liquids around itself. Endotoxin production (choice B) is not an attribute of S. epidermidis. Endotoxin, or lipopolysaccharide is a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. S. epidermidis is a gram-positive organism. Intracellular habitat (choice C) is not an attribute of S. epidermidis. Staphylococci are extracellular bacteria. Novobiocin resistance (choice D) is exhibited by S. saprophyticus but not S. epidermidis, and it is a diagnostic aid, not a pathogenicity factor. Superantigen action (choice E) is expressed by the exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but it does not contribute to the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis."

He has developed weight loss and severe dehydration. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacillus anthracis",
      "B. Salmonella enterica subsp. typhi",
      "C. Shigella sonnei",
      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Yersinia pestis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The child has shigellosis (bacillary dysentery), which is an acute infection of the bowel that can be caused by a variety of Shigella organisms, including S. flexneri, S. sonnei (the most common isolate in the United States), S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae. The organism is spread via the fecal-oral route by contaminated food or inanimate objects; spread in contaminated water is unusual. Epidemics commonly occur in crowded populations with poor sanitation. Mini-epidemics have occurred in the daycare setting. The presentation given here is typical; adults may have a slower presentation. Diagnosis is important because untreated children may die (of dehydration and circulatory collapse) in the first 12 days. Fluid replacement is the most critical aspect of therapy and may require IV fluids in severe cases. The condition resolves spontaneously; use of antibiotics (TMP-SMX) may shorten duration. Bacillus anthracis (choice A) causes anthrax, which can produce skin infection and pneumonia. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi (choice B) causes typhoid fever, which differs from shigellosis because it is an enteric fever with more prominent systemic symptoms. Vibrio cholerae (choice D) causes cholera, with characteristic 'rice-water stool' diarrhea. Yersinia pestis (choice E) causes plague, with prominent lymph node and lung involvement."

      "E. A gram-positive, coagulase-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This is a case of ecthyma gangrenosum, the hallmark lesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. It is a common nosocomial infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, or severe burns. P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-positive, aerobic (a nonfermenter), and catalase-positive. It is a prodigious producer of a capsule (slime layer) and is also distinguished by its production of a blue-green pigment and a grapelike odor. Bacillus is a gram-positive aerobic, spore-forming rod (choice B). Superficially, the skin lesion of anthrax (the anthrax eschar) might resemble the lesion caused by Pseudomonas but would not be a common finding in burn patients and indeed is quite rare in the United States. Clostridium is an anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive rod (choice C). Clostridium would not be a common pathogen in burn patients and would not cause such a lesion. A gram-positive, coagulase-negative coccus (choice D) could be Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus or any of the members of the genus Streptococcus. None of these agents would be likely to produce a lesion such as the one shown. Staph. epidermidis is a member of the normal skin flora and is best known for its ability to colonize intravenous catheters and the endocardium via its production of a biofilm. Staph. saprophyticus is best known as an agent of urinary tract infection in young, sexually active women, and the streptococci cause a wide variety of diseases, such as pharyngitis, meningitis, cellulitis, and endocarditis. Staph. aureus is a gram-positive coagulase-positive coccus (choice E). It is a member of the normal skin flora and causes abscesses, furuncles and boils, but not the lesion shown in the image here."

Which of the following is most likely responsible for the skin rash?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Hyaluronic acid capsule",
      "D. M protein",
      "E. Pyrogenic exotoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The rash described is that of scarlet fever, which can be a complication of streptococcal sore throat (as in this question) or streptococcal wound infection. In past centuries, scarlet fever was a major childhood disease that often caused death, but it has become much less common (possibly as a result of early antibiotic therapy) and is now only a rare cause of death. The fever and rash in this disease are due to the pyrogenic exotoxin, which is phage-encoded. The alpha toxins (choice A) of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are cytolysins. The alpha toxin of S. aureus is a pore former, and that of C. perfringens is a lecithinase. Endotoxin (choice B) is found in gram-negative organisms. Endotoxin directly activates macrophages to overproduce IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and causes gram-negative shock. Hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein (choices C and D) are both found in Streptococcus pyogenes, but are not responsible for the fever and rash seen in the present case. The hyaluronic acid capsule is non-immunogenic and makes it difficult for the immune system to recognize the infection. M protein is an anti-phagocytic surface protein."

      "C. Ephedrine",
      "D. Phenelzine",
      "E. Succinylcholine"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Botulism is caused by a protein toxin produced by the gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin type A is also available commercially as the compound OnabotulinumtoxinA. Botulinum toxin selectively cleaves the docking proteins for acetylcholine (ACh) exocytosis. As a result, there is decreased ACh transmission in all parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions and decreased sympathetic cholinergic transmission in sweat glands and neuromuscular junctions. Mydriasis is a result of decreased ACh activity on muscarinic receptors in parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions. Skeletal muscle weakness results from decreased ACh stimulation of nicotinic receptors in neuromuscular junctions. Skeletal muscle weakness is the differentiating feature between anticholinergic agents (i.e., atropine) and botulinum toxin. Serious adverse effects of botulinum toxin type A include respiratory compromise, development or worsening of acute angle-closure glaucoma, brachial plexopathy, dysphonia, muscle weakness, and anticholinergic side effects. Atropine (choice A), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, causes tachycardia, mydriasis, and elevated body temperature but does not cause muscle weakness. Ephedrine (choice C) is an indirect sympathomimetic and causes tachycardia, mydriasis, and possibly elevated body temperature from increased metabolic rate. It would not cause diffuse muscle weakness, however. Phenelzine (choice D), an MAO inhibitor, would also enhance the sympathetic system but with no effects on skeletal muscle. Succinylcholine (choice E), a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, causes muscle weakness but none of the other symptoms."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Although now rare in the United States due to vaccination programs, diphtheria is a serious disease with fatality rates between 5 and 10% in adults. The disease is an upper respiratory tract infection characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent pseudomembrane on the tonsil, pharynx, and/or nose. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a facultatively anaerobic gram-positive bacterium. Diphtheria toxin inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) in eukaryotic cells via ADP-ribosylation. The inactivation of eEF-2 inhibits cell protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. This directly affects translation elongation. Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin primarily targets the heart, nerves, and epithelium. Transcription initiation (choice A) and elongation (choice B) may be affected by drugs that target RNA polymerase, such as rifampin. These drugs are mainly used for mycobacteria. Transcription termination (choice C) is usually determined by chromatin structure, such as pin-loops. It is not generally easily targeted for inhibition by toxins or drugs. Translation initiation (choice D) may be affected by certain antimicrobials such as aminoglycosides. Translation termination (choice F) is not generally a target of toxins."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is diagnosed with urinary tract obstruction and undergoes surgical correction. An indwelling urinary catheter is in place and two days later, the patient develops a urinary tract infection. Cultures of the urine grow non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rods. The most likely causal organism also causes which of the following illnesses?",
    "options": [
      "A. Esophagitis in AIDS patients",
      "B. Hot-tub folliculitis",
      "C. Neonatal septicemia",
      "D. Pneumonia in AIDS patients",
      "E. Staghorn calculi in the urinary tract"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that produces blue-green pigments. It can easily be distinguished from the family Enterobacteriaceae because Pseudomonas is oxidase-positive. It is an opportunistic pathogen that has an increased chance of causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients who have indwelling catheters or who are on antibiotics. Pseudomonas is an agent of hot-tub folliculitis in normal patients using contaminated spas, and causes infections in burn patients and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. Esophagitis in AIDS patients (choice A) can be caused by Candida albicans. This is a yeast that can cause urinary tract infections in poorly controlled diabetics because glucose in the urine enhances its growth. Neonatal septicemia (choice C) is most frequently caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes. Of these, S. agalactiae is a gram-positive coccus and L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod; and although E. coli is a gram-negative rod, it is oxidase-negative and lactose-fermenting. E. coli is the most common cause of UTI overall. Pneumonia in AIDS patients (choice D) is caused by a variety of organisms, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis and Pneumocystis jiroveci. None of these is a gram-negative bacillus. Staghorn calculi in the urinary tract (choice E) are formed during infections with urease-positive organisms such as Proteus and Ureaplasma. Proteus is a gram-negative rod but is oxidase-negative, and Ureaplasma is a cell wall-less prokaryote related to Mycoplasma that would not stain at all with Gram stain."

      "A. Common core polysaccharide",
      "B. Lecithinase",
      "C. Lipid A",
      "D. O-specific polysaccharide",
      "E. Peptidoglycan"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Septic shock is a feared, potentially fatal complication of systemic infection with a wide variety of gram-negative organisms. The primary toxic agent is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Further, it has been established that the most toxic part of the LPS is lipid A. The pathophysiologic effects of LPS are related to triggering the release of potent cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor) from macrophages and activation of coagulation cascades. Common core polysaccharide (choice A) is a portion of the LPS that is the same in all gram-negative bacteria. The polysaccharide component of LPS is the immunogenic component. It is not the most important factor in pathogenesis. Lecithinase (choice B) is an enzyme produced by Clostridium perfringens that damages cell membranes. O-specific polysaccharide (choice D) is a portion of the LPS that induces specific immunity. Peptidoglycan (choice E) is found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and can be indirectly linked to LPS."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient became symptomatic with prolonged diarrhea, which is common in AIDS patients. All of the agents on the list are common causes of diarrhea in AIDS, but the only one that would produce acid-fast oocysts of this size in the stool is Cryptosporidium. Adenovirus (choice A) is a viral cause of diarrhea in AIDS. Viruses are minute in size compared to bacteria and eukaryotes, and would not be visible by standard microscopy of the stool. Listeria (choice C) is a gram-positive bacterium. Most bacteria measure less than 2 microns in size. Mycobacterium avium complex (choice D) commonly presents in AIDS patients with diarrhea, fever, and wasting. Although the organism is acid-fast, it is a bacterium that is intracellular, and as such its size is much smaller than that of a eukaryote. Salmonella (choice E) is a common cause of diarrhea in AIDS, but it is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacterium that would be about 2 μm in diameter."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This child has neonatal infection with Escherichia coli. The most important pathogenic attribute of the strains that cause neonatal disease is the K1 capsule that prevents phagocytosis. Most of the strains that cause this have the K1 serotype. E. coli is the most common gram-negative rod that infects children from maternal contamination as they pass through the birth canal. Beta hemolysis (choice A) is an attribute of some strains of urotropic E. coli but is not a major factor in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Biofilm production (choice B) is an attribute of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and enteroaggregative E. coli, but is not believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Exotoxin production (choice C) is involved in enterotoxigenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli pathogenesis, but is not believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli neonatal disease. Motility (choice E) is an important pathogenic mechanism among the agents of urinary tract infection because it gives them the ability to enter the bladder against the flow of urine. It is not believed to be important in the pathogenesis of neonatal disease caused by E. coli."

      "D. Dog bite",
      "E. Endogenous flora"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has pseudoappendicitis, and Yersinia enterocolitica is the pathogen that produces this clinical syndrome. Yersinia is transmitted to patients via the oral route, most commonly from contaminated milk, and occasionally, from blood transfusion. Y. enterocolitica is associated with cooler climates since it grows well at less than body temperature. Arthropod vectors (choice A) are not involved in transmission of Y. enterocolitica. Arthropods such as ticks transmit tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. Insects such as mosquitoes transmit viral encephalitides and malaria. Contaminated ground beef (choice B) is involved in the transmission of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), but is not a common source of infection with Y. enterocolitica. Dog bite (choice D) is not involved in the transmission of Y. enterocolitica. Dogs may transmit rabies, Capnocytophaga or Pasteurella. Endogenous transmission (choice E) is important in the formation of intestinal abscesses by anaerobic normal flora organisms, but is not believed to be involved with Y. enterocolitica transmission."

    "options": [
      "A. Activation of macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines",
      "B. Block release of acetylcholine",
      "C. Block release of GABA and glycine",
      "D. Increasing levels of cAMP",
      "E. Inhibition of protein synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This boy is displaying the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis with bronchiectasis (accounting for the foul-smelling sputum) and pancreatic insufficiency producing steatorrhea. However, the question directly relates to the infectious agent causing the pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an oxidase-positive bacterium with a fruity aroma. Pseudomonas produces blue-green pigments that act as siderophores when grown in an iron-limited environment, but are often colorless on blood agar. P. aeruginosa is a strictly aerobic, gram-negative rod that produces an exotoxin (exotoxin A) that ADP-ribosylates, and therefore inhibits, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2), which is a G protein involved in the eukaryotic translation of proteins. Activation of macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines (choice A) is the mechanism by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes damage. This is an endotoxin and is not to be confused with an exotoxin. Blocking release of acetylcholine (choice B) is specific for Clostridium botulinum which produces a neurotoxin that causes a flaccid paralysis. Blocking release of GABA and glycine (choice C) is specific for Clostridium tetani which produces a neurotoxin that causes a spastic paralysis. Increasing levels of cAMP (choice D) refers to the toxins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Vibrio cholerae, Bordetella pertussis and Bacillus anthracis. These exotoxins each increase cellular fluid loss, leading to the causation of edema or diarrhea."

Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F) Physical examination shows pronounced cervical lymphadenopathy Laboratory studies show moderate lymphocytosis She is 3 months pregnant with her first child Transmission of the infection to the fetus is most likely to result in which of the following sequelae?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hydrops fetalis",
      "B. Necrotizing encephalitis",
      "C. Patent ductus arteriosus",
      "D. Pulmonary stenosis",
      "E. Retinochoroiditis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Toxoplasma gondii is capable of crossing the placenta and causing harmful fetal infection only during an acute maternal infection. During this period, rapidly dividing forms called tachyzoites can be spread via the bloodstream and thus cross the placenta. As soon as the maternal immune response is initiated, parasitemia ceases and the parasite can no longer enter the fetus. In a patient such as this one, occupational exposure to cats (the definitive host of the parasite) might be assumed. In the general U.S. population, however, it is more common to acquire the infection from poorly cooked pork. When the organism infects the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy there is little risk of fetal infection, but infections that do occur often involve serious damage to the central nervous system, e.g. necrotizing encephalitis, or disseminated disease. When the organism infects the mother in later trimesters the fetus has a greater likelihood of infection, but most of those infections will be asymptomatic. Hydrops fetalis (choice A) is a common consequence of fetal infection with the B19 virus, which infects immature erythrocytes. It may occur following in utero infection with Toxoplasma but it is not the most common sequela. Patent ductus arteriosus (choice C) and pulmonary stenosis (choice D) are aspects of congenital rubella syndrome, caused when rubella virus crosses the placenta. Retinochoroiditis (choice E) is a consequence of infection of second- and third-trimester fetuses with Toxoplasma gondii. It may also occur 20 to 30 years after birth in children born with asymptomatic Toxoplasma infections."

      "E. Gram-positive bacillus",
      "F. Gram-positive coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. The clinical presentation and lumbar puncture suggests meningitis. The presence of numerous neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests a bacterial pathogen. The most common cause of neonatal meningitis is Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a gram-positive coccus. Acid-fast bacillus (choice A) describes a bacterium in the genus Mycobacterium. These bacteria are not causes of neonatal meningitis. Double-stranded DNA virus with nuclear membrane envelope (choice B) describes a virus in the herpesvirus family. Herpesviruses may cause encephalitis in newborns but would not be a likely cause of meningitis in this age group. A gram-negative bacillus (choice C) describes Escherichia coli among many others. E. coli is the second most common cause of neonatal meningitis. Gram-negative diplococcus (choice D) describes the genera Neisseria, Moraxella and Veillonella. Of these, Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis, but usually in adolescents and young adults. It would not be the most common cause of a neonatal presentation such as this one. Gram-positive bacillus (choice E) describes Listeria monocytogenes among others. Listeria is the third most common cause of neonatal meningitis in the United States."

Infection with which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cryptosporidium parvum",
      "B. Dientamoeba fragilis",
      "C. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "D. Giardia lamblia",
      "E. Isospora belli"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Entamoeba histolytica may produce asymptomatic infection or more severe disease characterized by mucosal ulcerations and submucosal spread causing abdominal distress and bloody stools. Stools may show either trophozoite forms or the typical spherical cysts. E. histolytica cysts characteristically are spherical in shape, are 10-20 μm in diameter and have granular cytoplasm containing up to four nuclei. Cryptosporidium parvum (choice A) infections occur in the immunocompromised population and may cause severe diarrhea. The organism presents as minute (2-5 μm) intracellular spheres or arc-shaped merozoites under normal mucosa, and can be difficult to see by light microscopy. Cysts in the stool are too small (4-5 μm) to be confused with Entamoeba. Dientamoeba fragilis (choice B) is an intestinal ameba that also may produce an infectious diarrhea. It does not have a cyst form, and only the trophozoite forms are seen in stools. Giardia lamblia (choice D) is a flagellate protozoan that infects the stomach and small intestine when contaminated water is ingested. Diagnosis is usually made by examining duodenal contents; however, the stools may contain the oval or elliptical cysts, which are thick-walled and measure 8-14 μm in diameter. Spherical cysts are not seen in Giardia infection, and giardial diarrheas are not bloody. Isospora belli (choice E) produces self-limited intestinal infections, mostly in the tropics, in which fever and diarrhea may last weeks to months. The stool-borne cysts are much larger than Entamoeba (30 by 15 μm), are asymmetrical, and are typically almond-shaped."

    "options": [
      "A. Multiple serotypes",
      "B. Negative-sense genome",
      "C. Spread by respiratory droplets",
      "D. Syncytia formation",
      "E. Viral hemagglutinin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The disease is mumps, caused by a paramyxovirus. In children, mumps causes a transient inflammation of the parotid glands, and less commonly, of the testes, pancreas, or central nervous system. Mumps tends to be a more severe disease in adults than in children. Mumps in adults involves the testes (causing orchitis) and pancreas with some frequency. The paramyxoviruses are negative-sense RNA viruses that spread from cell to cell by syncytia formation. This protects them from exposure to substances that exist extracellularly (such as antibodies) and makes cell-mediated immunity an absolutely essential event for recovery and cure. This is why the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine must be live-attenuated, to stimulate strong cell-mediated immunity. Multiple serotypes (choice A) of medical importance do not exist in mumps virus. The vaccine contains a single serotype. A negative-sense genome (choice B) is possessed by the Paramyxoviridae, but this attribute is not associated with the lack of efficacy of antibodies. The negative-sense genome causes these viruses to require a virion-associated polymerase for infectivity. It is true that the mumps virus is spread by respiratory droplets (choice C) - but this attribute does not have a relationship to making antibodies ineffective in cure. Many viruses that are spread by respiratory droplets can be prevented by an adequate IgA or IgG antibody response. Viral hemagglutinin (choice E) in the case of mumps virus exists in a complex with the neuraminidase molecule and thus is not found alone on the surface of the virion. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase complex is responsible for the attachment to cells via sialic acid residues and the release from the cell following the clipping off of sialic acid residues. Many viruses that have hemagglutinin-neuraminidase complexes on the surface of their membrane can be neutralized by antibodies, so this attribute does not contribute to the need for a cell-mediated immune response."

Out of 100 bacterial cultures subsequently tested, two cultures showed ampicillin resistance but failed to show viral cytolysis. Which of the following processes of DNA transfer most likely occurred in these two cultures?",
    "options": [
      "A. F+ to F- conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Hfr to F- conjugation",
      "D. Homologous recombination",
      "E. Site-specific recombination",
      "F. Specialized transduction",
      "G. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The mechanism involving transfer of bacterial DNA from cell to cell using a lytic phage as a vector is called generalized transduction. It occurs when bacterial DNA is accidentally captured into a phage head during the lytic virus life cycle and then transferred to another bacterial cell. If the recipient cell is capable of homologous recombination of the newly donated DNA, then that cell can acquire new genetic traits that will persist stably in its genome. F+ to F- conjugation (choice A) involves the transfer of a plasmid from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. The experimental situation described here does not involve two cells exchanging DNA, but rather a virus picking up DNA from one cell and transferring it to another. Hfr to F- conjugation (choice C) involves the transfer of chromosomal DNA from one cell to another via cell-to-cell contact. The experimental situation described here does not involve two cells exchanging DNA. Homologous recombination (choice D) is a process by which linear DNA that has been delivered into a new cell can be successfully recombined into the chromosome and stabilized for the next generation. It is not a mechanism of transfer of bacterial DNA, but rather a mechanism which allows for the protection of DNA transferred into another cell. Although homologous recombination is a necessary final step in all mechanisms of transfer of bacterial DNA with the exception of the F+ to F- cross, it is not the means by which a virus transfers DNA from cell to cell. Site-specific recombination (choice E) is a process by which circles of DNA may become integrated together. It occurs during the lysogenic viral life cycle, when transposons move within bacterial cells, and during the formation of the Hfr chromosome when a conjugative plasmid inserts itself into the bacterial genome. It is not a mechanism of transfer of DNA from cell to another. Specialized transduction (choice F) is the mechanism by which lysogenic (temperate) phages transfer DNA from one bacterium to another as an accident of the lysogenic viral life cycle. Viruses establish lysogeny by inserting their DNA into the bacterial chromosome by site-specific recombination. Later, if an error of excision occurs during induction, bacterial genes adjacent to the insertion site may be transferred. Since the virus that was added to cultures in this question was a lytic virus, it is not capable of performing this type of transduction. Transformation (choice G) is the process by which free bacterial DNA can be picked up by competent bacteria, imported, and integrated into the chromosome with homologous recombination. No viruses are involved in transformation."

      "B. Clostridium perfringens",
      "C. Francisella tularensis",
      "D. Listeria monocytogenes",
      "E. Yersinia pestis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Any previously healthy person in the Southwestern United States who develops septic shock or severe pulmonary disease should be evaluated for plague. Plague is not an extinct disease but is still encountered in sporadic cases in various places in the world, including Asia, Africa, parts of Europe, and the U.S. Southwest. The causative organism is Yersinia pestis which is endemic in many wild-animal populations and can be transmitted to humans either by direct contact or by flea bite. Human plague may take many forms, including pestis minor (mild lymphadenopathy), bubonic plague (prominent hemorrhagic lymphadenopathy), pneumonic plague (as in this patient), and septicemic plague. The primary pneumonic form typically presents as described. Antibiotics are most effective if given within the first 24 hours, which can be problematic if medical staff does not suspect the disease. Since plague is rare in the United States, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required to make a rapid diagnosis and to institute timely treatment. If the diagnosis is missed, the mortality rate is quite high. Brucella abortus (choice A) causes brucellosis characterized by undulating fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Brucellosis occurs rarely in the United States, mainly in slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians and farmers. Clostridium perfringens (choice B) causes gangrene and gastroenteritis. Francisella tularensis (choice C) causes tularemia, which is associated with a spectrum of manifestations from an influenza-like syndrome to adenopathy with ulceration at the site of inoculation. In the United States it occurs most commonly in hunters in Arkansas and Missouri. Listeria monocytogenes (choice D) causes listeriosis. Infection during pregnancy may result in sepsis, abortion, or premature delivery. Infection in the neonate may produce meningitis. In immunocompromised adults, either meningitis or sepsis may occur."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The tests mentioned reveal a gram-positive coccus with the characteristics of Staphylococcus (gram-positive cocci in grapelike clusters). The organism is beta-hemolytic (breaks hemoglobin down to a colorless product) and catalase-positive (produces water and oxygen gas from the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide). Production of a fibrin clot in a tube of animal serum reveals that the organism is coagulase-positive. The only organism that fits all of these criteria is Staphylococcus aureus. Staph. aureus evades phagocytosis by producing protein A, which binds to the Fc component of IgG, thus preventing opsonization. Capsules (choice A) of bacteria and fungi are antiphagocytic but this is not the means used by S. aureus to evade phagocytosis. Key encapsulated organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans. Diffuse fimbriate layers (choice B) of gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes cause adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. They do not protect against phagocytosis. IgA proteases (choice C) are produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae. They do not protect against phagocytosis, although they do tend to prevent the bacteria that produce them from immediately being shed from the mucosal surfaces. Inactivation of complement (choice D) is a mechanism used by Strep. pneumoniae to protect itself against opsonization."

Culture of the urine grows 10⁵ colony-forming units of gram-positive cocci/mL. Sensitivity testing using the Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion test shows that the isolate is resistant to ciprofloxacin. Which of the following is the most likely location of this drug-resistance gene?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chromosome",
      "B. Conjugative plasmid",
      "C. Episome",
      "D. Nonconjugative plasmid",
      "E. Prophage"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has cystitis caused by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Quinolones inhibit DNA synthesis, recombination, and repair by inhibiting DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV. The genes encoding resistance to quinolones are primarily chromosomally encoded and involve mutations in the structural genes for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase type IV. It also involves decreased drug uptake caused by mutations in genes that regulate membrane permeability. Another minor mechanism involved in quinolone resistance, which is encoded by plasmids, consists of the overexpression of a pumping mechanism that actively exports the drug. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone whose main mechanism of resistance is chromosomally mediated. Conjugative plasmids (choice B) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that are capable of mediating their own transfer from cell to cell via conjugation. Although they are a very common source of drug-resistance genes, they are not involved in the majority of the cases of resistance to quinolones. Episomes (choice C) are plasmids that have been integrated into the chromosome of the bacterial cell. Genes encoding quinolone resistance are not known to exist in episome form. Nonconjugative plasmids (choice D) are extrachromosomal circles of DNA that do not contain the tra operon. They are not involved in quinolone resistance. Prophages (choice E) are temperate bacteriophages that have integrated their DNA into the chromosome of the bacterial cell. Although abnormal excision can cause bacteriophages of this type to transfer drug-resistance genes the prophage DNA, by itself does not include the drug-resistance genes."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman who recently emigrated from Africa develops thick, erythematous nodules on the ears and nose with significant associated sensory loss. The nodules have grown slowly over the course of many years. Biopsy of the lesions shows dermal granulomas with giant cells and a few acid-fast bacteria. Cultures on blood agar and Lowenstein-Jensen medium show no growth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cutaneous leishmaniasis",
      "B. Lepromatous leprosy",
      "C. Onchocerciasis",
      "D. Rhinoscleroma",
      "E. Smallpox",
      "F. Tuberculoid leprosy"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. Mycobacterium leprae is endemic to parts of Africa, Asia, and South America. Tuberculoid leprosy is an indolent disease, typically affecting cooler parts of the body (such as the nose and ears) producing dermal granulomas with rare, acid-fast bacilli and damage to peripheral nerves. This is in marked contrast to lepromatous leprosy, which is progressive, invasive and generally characterized by the presence of numerous acid-fast bacteria in a histiocytic but nongranulomatous tissue response. M. leprae has not been successfully grown on artificial media. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (choice A) is due to Leishmania species that show a worldwide distribution. The infection is transmitted through a sandfly bite, and the skin lesion is typically ulcerated. Histology shows intracellular parasites within the dermis and epidermis. Granulomas are not formed. Lepromatous leprosy (choice B) is the form of disease when the wrong T-helper (TH) cell is activated. Because TH2 cells stimulate antibody production, they have no value against an intracellular pathogen, and the patient develops disfiguring disseminated disease. Onchocerciasis (choice C) or river blindness, is a roundworm infection transmitted by blackflies of Africa and South America. The microfilariae grow at the site of inoculation and cause an inflamed subcutaneous nodule. The organism is seen on tissue sections. Rhinoscleroma (choice D) is a destructive granulomatous infection of the nasopharynx and is caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. Gram-negative rods can be cultured from the lesions. Smallpox (choice E), the infection caused by the variola virus (a DNA poxvirus) produces malaise, headaches, and a macular/pustular rash involving the face and distal extremities. Smallpox has been eradicated through worldwide vaccination."

    "question": "A 50-year-old woman develops a fever headache, chills, and fatigue 1 week after returning from a trip to the woods A peripheral blood smear shows small rings in the red blood cells The vector of this disease can also transmit which of the following organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "B. Colorado tick fever virus",
      "C. Francisella tularensis",
      "D. Rickettsia rickettsii",
      "E. West Nile virus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The combination of a 1-week incubation period and the intraerythrocytic parasites strongly suggests Babesia microti as the infecting organism. The clinical disease is called babesiosis. The infecting protozoan is related to Plasmodium and is transmitted by the bite of the Ixodes scapularis tick. Occasional cases have been transmitted by blood transfusions. Most patients are asymptomatic; symptomatic cases in reasonably healthy individuals have the features described in the question stem. Rare severe cases, which may be fatal, may develop in severely debilitated or asplenic individuals and can be accompanied by severe hemolysis (up to 30% of red blood cells may have the parasites) with subsequent hemoglobinuria, hemolysis, and renal failure. Ixodes ticks are potential vectors of Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi) and Anaplasma (formerly Ehrlichia) phagocytophila (the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis). Colorado tick fever virus (choice B), Francisella tularensis (choice C) and Rickettsia rickettsii (choice D) are all transmitted by the Dermacentor tick, not the Ixodes tick. West Nile encephalitis virus (choice E) is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes."

    "question": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive muscular weakness and poor head control. The mother says that she feeds the boy a soy-based formula sweetened with honey. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is ingestion of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. A gram-positive vegetative bacillus",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Exotoxin",
      "D. Neurotoxin",
      "E. Spores"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This baby has infant botulism (floppy-baby syndrome), which is due to germination of Clostridium botulinum spores in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. This disorder is most common in children under the age of 6 months. Older children and adults do not appear to be vulnerable to this form of botulism, but are susceptible to botulism caused by ingestion of preformed toxin. Floppy-baby syndrome is acquired following the ingestion of spores of the organism. A gram-positive vegetative bacillus (choice A) describes C. botulinum, but it is not ingestion of the vegetative bacteria that causes this condition. Endotoxin (choice B), or lipopolysaccharide, is found on all gram-negative bacteria; and C. botulinum is a gram-positive rod. Exotoxin (choice C) could describe any secreted toxin, including neurotoxins, but again this infant's condition was not an intoxication and was not due to ingestion of any kind of toxin directly. A neurotoxin (choice D) describes tetanospasmin or botulinum toxin, which is produced by C. tetani or C. botulinum respectively. Tetanus toxin causes a rigid paralysis due to the inhibition of glycine and GABA at inhibitory synapses. The present case is one of infant botulism, which was not due to ingestion of a preformed toxin or an intoxication as is adult botulism."

    "question": "Public Health authorities are notified of an outbreak of diarrhea with leukocytes, blood and mucus at a day-care center in Minnesota Of the 14 affected children within the ages of 3 to 5 years old, all had fever leukocytosis and pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Helicobacter pylori",
      "B. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi",
      "C. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Yersinia enterocolitica"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Yersinia enterocolitica is an important cause of 'mini-epidemics' of pediatric diarrhea. Outbreaks are common in colder climates and the organism can be grown well at 4°C (39.2°F). Adults can also be affected, but less commonly than children. Some diarrheal cases are severe (and occasionally fatal) and may be complicated by severe dysentery, appendicitis, or chronic relapsing ileocolitis that may require antibiotics (quinolone, third-generation cephalosporin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) to shorten the course. Helicobacter pylori (choice A) is an important cause of gastritis and ulcers. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi (choice B) causes typhoid fever. It is not common in the United States, but symptoms of infection include fever, abdominal rash and splenomegaly. Diarrhea is not a consistent feature. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice C) usually causes respiratory infections rather than diarrhea. Vibrio cholerae (choice D) causes cholera. It is not a common cause of diarrhea in day-care centers in the United States but is normally associated with massive environmental doses of bacteria in contaminated water. Patients with cholera have severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."

    "question": "Several employees at a large company come to employee health services because of a 2-day history of multiple episodes of watery diarrhea. Some have had blood-tinged stools and some have had profound abdominal cramping and fever. All the affected individuals attended a dinner party several days ago. An overnight stool culture at 42°C (107.6°F) grows microaerophilic, oxidase-positive, gram-negative curved rods with polar flagella. Which of the following is the most likely source of this infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. 'Carrier' food handlers",
      "B. Custard and potato-salad dishes",
      "C. Milk and cream",
      "D. Poorly canned green vegetables",
      "E. Poorly washed salad greens",
      "F. Poultry dishes",
      "G. Rare red meat dishes",
      "H. Rice dishes",
      "I. Smoked fish",
      "J. Soft cheeses"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. This case history and culture characteristics describe a typical gastroenteritis due to Campylobacter jejuni, the most common bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. Contaminated poultry or poultry products are responsible for more than 60% of all infections. Carriers (choice A) are not known to occur with Campylobacter, and are best known with Salmonella typhi. Typhoid fever is an enteric fever that presents with fever, lymphadenopathy and constipation. Custard and potato-salad dishes (choice B) would be the most likely source if the agent was Staphylococcus aureus, but this would have had an onset of 2 hours, and a gram-positive coccus would have been the cause. Milk and cream (choice C) might contain Listeria or Mycobacterium bovis, but Listeria is a gram-positive rod and Mycobacterium is an acid-fast rod. Both may cause a minor gastroenteritis in healthy adults but would be unlikely to present with blood in the stool. Poorly canned green vegetables (choice D) are the usual source of Clostridium botulinum, which would cause a flaccid paralysis. Clostridium is a genus of gram-positive rods. Poorly washed salad greens (choice E) could be sources of infection with multiple agents such as Escherichia coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella or Shigella. The E. coli strains which cause non-bloody diarrhea are usually associated with travel out of the home country (traveler's diarrhea). E. coli is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-negative. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that does not occur commonly in the United States but instead requires travel to a tropical country, and Salmonella and Shigella would be more likely to cause frankly bloody stools. Both are gram-negative rods that are oxidase-negative. Rare red meat dishes (choice G) would be good sources for Escherichia coli or Trichinella spiralis. E. coli is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod and Trichinella is a nematode. The serotype of E. coli associated with rare meat dishes in the United States causes bloody diarrhea without leukocytes. Trichinosis causes myalgia, fever, eosinophilia, splinter hemorrhages and periorbital edema. Rice dishes (choice H) are most frequently incriminated in the transmission of Bacillus cereus, which has a 1-to-2-hour onset of vomiting followed by diarrhea. Bacillus is a genus of gram-positive rods. Smoked fish (choice I) is a common source of Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive spore-forming rod that would produce a flaccid paralysis. Soft cheeses (choice J) are a common source of Listeria monocytogenes, which is a gram-positive rod that causes mild gastroenteritis."

    "question": "A healthy 32-year-old primigravid woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal examination. She states that she emigrated from Southeast Asia and that three years ago, she had fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice joint pains, and generalized skin lesions that slowly disappeared. Which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered to investigate the patient's past illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibody",
      "B. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM antibody",
      "C. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)",
      "D. IgM antibody to HBcAg",
      "E. IgM antibody to HBsAg"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The clinical signs suggest that this woman had hepatitis B three years ago, and the fact that she is now feeling better also suggests that she recovered from this infection. Since she is pregnant, it is necessary to find out if she still has the agent in her liver (chronic hepatitis B infection) by performing a test for HBsAg. This test will be negative if she has completely recovered from the disease, but it will be positive if she is a chronic carrier. Ordering CMV IgG antibody (choice A) would be of no value because the clinical signs of the disease she had 3 years ago do not match those of CMV, and CMV does not produce chronic infections. Quantitation of HAV IgM antibody (choice B) would be useless, since HAV only causes acute infection. Measurement of IgM antibody to HBcAg (choice D) would be of no value at this time. This antibody is positive in acute hepatitis B, but would no longer be positive in this case. Examination of IgM antibody to HBsAg (choice E) would be of no value at this time. This antibody would be formed early during the recovery from acute hepatitis B, and would class-switch to IgG later on in the disease."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man is struck by a car and sustains crush injuries to both legs. Two days later, he develops a severe infection of the legs. Physical examination shows crepitus of the tissue of the legs. An x-ray of the legs shows radiolucent pockets in the soft tissues Which of the following toxins produced by the most likely causal organism is responsible for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Enterotoxin",
      "D. Neurotoxin",
      "E. superantigen toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The disease described is gas gangrene, which is caused by the spore-forming anaerobe Clostridium perfringens and other closely related species. These very dangerous bacteria particularly like to grow in necrotic vascular tissue, and they produce a variety of destructive enzymes and toxins. The toxin produced by C. perfringens that is most strongly associated with myonecrosis is the alpha toxin, which is a lecithinase (phospholipase C) that lyses erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells. This toxin mediates massive hemolysis, increased vascular permeability and bleeding, hepatotoxicity, bradycardia, and hypotension. In the laboratory, the action of the lecithinase can be observed in Nagler's reaction, in which strains of C. perfringens will lyse the lecithin in egg-yolk agar. Endotoxin (choice B) is lipopolysaccharide and is not found on gram-positive organisms such as Clostridium. Enterotoxins (choice C) are produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including C. perfringens but the vignette is clearly specific for myonecrosis and not gastroenteritis. Neurotoxins (choice D) are produced by other members of the genera Clostridium (C. tetanus and C. botulinum), but not by C. perfringens. Superantigen toxin (choice E) is specific for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and the pyrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes. These exotoxins cause fever, petechial rash, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy."

Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. It captures a nuclear membrane envelope",
      "B. It replicates in the cytoplasm",
      "C. It replicates in the nucleus",
      "D. It utilizes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase",
      "E. It utilizes reverse transcriptase"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The lesions are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum, a typically benign and self-limited condition caused by a poxvirus. The disease can be transmitted either sexually or through direct nonsexual contact. Patients with advanced HIV infection may develop a severe, generalized, and persistent eruption, often involving the face and upper body. Molluscum contagiosum virus is a poxvirus that reproduces in the cytoplasm and produces intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Capturing a nuclear membrane envelope (choice A) and replication in the nucleus (choice C) are characteristics of Herpesviridae. This family includes herpes simplex 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster, herpes 6 and herpes 8. None of these agents cause umbilicated warts, although rashes may occur. Herpes simplex causes vesicular lesions on the mucosae and varicella causes an asynchronous pruritic rash (chickenpox) or a unilateral vesicular rash that follows a dermatome (shingles). Utilization of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (choice D) is characteristic of all RNA viruses. Utilization of reverse transcriptase (choice E) is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus. Reverse transcriptase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase."

    "options": [
      "A. Crohn disease",
      "B. Diabetes mellitus",
      "C. Disseminated gonococcal infection",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has vulvovaginitis secondary to Candida infection. The condition is characterized by itching and soreness, pain on intercourse, finding of pseudohyphae in vaginal secretions, and absence of a particular odor. Predisposing factors include a high vaginal pH, diabetes, and use of antibiotics. The increased vulnerability in diabetes may reflect increased glucose concentrations in vaginal secretions and relative immunosuppression. Crohn disease (choice A) can predispose for fistulas involving the vagina, rather than vulvovaginitis. Dissemination of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (choice C) can cause septic arthritis. The discharge of gonorrhea is leukorrheic and will contain neutrophils full of gram-negative diplococci. Neither rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) nor systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) is specifically associated with Candida vulvovaginitis."

      "A. Ground beef",
      "B. Poultry",
      "C. Rice",
      "D. Salad greens",
      "E. Vacuum-packed fish"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This is a typical presentation of botulism, which is caused by the preformed toxin of Clostridium botulinum. Patients develop a progressive flaccid paralysis that can lead to death if the respiratory system is not adequately supported. Mentation is intact in these patients, and they do not exhibit sensory changes except for those related to failure of extraocular and intraocular muscles (e.g., diplopia, cycloplegia). The most common food sources implicated in botulism are canned alkaline vegetables and preserved fish. Since the genus Clostridium is anaerobic, materials packaged in the absence of oxygen will allow germination of the spores and the production of the toxin. Treatment is supportive. An antitoxin is available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) via state Health Departments, but may not be obtained early enough to be helpful. Most patients recover from food-borne botulism without any sequelae. Ground beef (choice A) is often implicated in transmission of Escherichia coli but is not involved in adult botulism. Poultry (choice B) is a common source of food poisoning caused by Campylobacter and Salmonella but is not a source of adult botulism. Rice (choice C) is a food often implicated in Bacillus cereus food poisoning, but not in adult botulism. Salad greens (choice D) are a source of foodborne illness in many tropical countries, as well as of Escherichia coli in the U.S., but are not implicated in the transmission of adult botulism."

      "C. Rubella",
      "D. Rubeola",
      "E. Varicella zoster virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, or Fifth disease. Adults typically do not get the facial rash ('slapped cheek') typical of children, but have arthralgias and arthritis. The symmetrical distribution of involved joints is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis. The onset in adults is typically 3 to 4 weeks after exposure. Parvovirus infections may persist in immunosuppressed patients, resulting in red blood cell aplasia. B19 virus can cross the placenta and cause hydrops fetalis because it infects erythroid precursors, and has been linked to the aplastic crises of sickle cell anemia. Human herpesvirus type 6 (choice A) is the causative agent of roseola infantum, which is a common childhood illness that causes an extremely high fever; the fever subsides and then the child develops a lacy body rash. Rubella (choice C) is the German measles, which is sometimes called the three-day measles. Although the rash looks similar to that of rubeola (measles) the rubella rash is less intense than that of rubeola. Rubella is best known for its ability to cross the placenta and cause serious congenital defects. Rubeola (choice D) is the measles, which is characterized by the 3 C's (cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis) and photophobia, Koplik spots, and a maculopapular rash that begins below the ears and eventually spreads downward and also covers the face. Varicella zoster virus (choice E) is the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles."

      "C. Respiratory droplets",
      "D. Sexual transmission",
      "E. Transplacental transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The lesions shown are ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, and in an AIDS patient, this is extremely suggestive of infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasmosis presents with seizures in 15-25% of cases. Because 70-80% of the world's population is seropositive, reactivational disease in the immunocompromised is extremely common. The disease is most commonly spread in the United States by ingestion of cysts from undercooked pork, but it can also be spread transplacentally or from cat feces. Tachyzoites develop intracellularly in phagocytic cells and then spread to the brain, muscle, and other tissues, where they encyst and multiply. Primary central nervous system lymphoma in AIDS patients can present clinically in nearly the same manner as toxoplasmosis, but the course is usually much more indolent. Fecal-oral contamination (choice B) is not the most common means of acquiring toxoplasmosis in the United States. Although cats serve as the necessary definitive host, and contamination with cat feces can cause infection, it is not the most common source in this country. Respiratory droplets (choice C) are not known to be a means of infection with T. gondii. Sexual transmission (choice D) is not known to occur in toxoplasmosis. Transplacental transmission (choice E) occurs with Toxoplasma in 2 to 6 out of every 1,000 live births. Although it is a serious cause of birth defects, this is not the most common route of infection in the United States."

      "C. Extracellular spirochetes",
      "D. Greatly enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with glassy amphophilic viral inclusions",
      "E. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient most likely has herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. HSV-1 is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis in the United States, accounting for approximately 10% to 20% of the 20,000 viral encephalitis cases that occur annually. Viral encephalitis is characterized by elevated lymphocytes and erythrocytes in the CSF. HSV-1 encephalitis has a propensity for the temporal lobes of the brain. Other types of viral encephalitis typically affect older patients, occur in the summer months (because of mosquito transmission), and have no particular association to regions of the brain. Cowdry type A inclusions are intranuclear viral inclusion bodies that may be found in both neurons and glia and are characteristic of herpes simplex infection. The presence of both distinct nuclear and ill-defined cytoplasmic inclusions (choice A) specifically suggests cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV infection of the brain characteristically occurs in severely immunosuppressed patients, in whom it tends to localize to the paraventricular subependymal regions of the brain. Extracellular spirochetes (choice C) can sometimes be demonstrated in patients with neuroborreliosis, the brain infection seen in Lyme disease, and in neurosyphilis. Neuroborreliosis can cause aseptic meningitis, facial nerve palsies, and encephalopathy. Neurosyphilis can occur in three basic forms: meningovascular syphilis (involving the base of the brain), general paresis (involving the frontal lobe and other areas of the neocortex), and tabes dorsalis (involving the dorsal roots and spinal cord). Greatly enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with glassy amorphic viral inclusions (choice D) are a feature of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This viral encephalitis usually occurs in immunosuppressed patients and is caused by the JC polyomavirus. PML is characterized by demyelination because it preferentially infects oligodendroglia. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells (choice E) are characteristic of chronic HIV encephalitis, which tends to involve in particular the subcortical white matter, diencephalon, and brainstem."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Patients with AIDS are prone to a variety of opportunistic infections, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia represents one of the most common initial presentations. This organism is a ubiquitous atypical fungus that may cause a life-threatening acute interstitial pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. P. jiroveci appears as a cystlike organism with a characteristic cup shape that has been likened to a 'crushed tennis ball'. Methenamine silver staining allows its identification in bronchoalveolar lavage. A frothy exudate filling the alveolar cavities is a characteristic finding in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia. Pneumocystis has been classified as a fungus by ribosomal RNA analysis, but it is an unusual member of the group. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus (choice A) describes the genus Staphylococcus. Staphylococcus does not silver-stain and is not a common cause of dyspnea in AIDS patients. An encapsulated monomorphic fungus (choice B) describes the genus Cryptococcus. This genus causes dangerous meningitis in the immunocompromised person, but is not a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS. An intracellular parasitic protozoan (choice D) describes Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasma may cause encephalitis in AIDS patients, but it would not be expected to cause pneumonia. An intracellular yeast (choice E) describes Histoplasma capsulatum. This agent causes acute and chronic pulmonary disease in AIDS patients, but would not produce methenamine silver-staining cysts."

    "question": "A 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because of a severe sore throat. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). Physical examination shows an erythematous posterior oropharynx with obvious abscesses on the tonsillar pillars, A rapid antigen test for Streptococcus pyogenes is positive. A beta-lactam antibiotic will have greatest efficacy at which of the following stages shown in the diagram?",
    "options": ["A. A", "B. B", "C. C", "D. D", "E. E", "F. F", "G. G"],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. In the bacterial growth curve, rapid exponential growth occurs during the log (or logarithmic growth) phase. Within this period, the generation time equals the time it takes for one cell to divide into two. Beta-lactam drugs act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. In a bacterial culture, cell wall synthesis will occur at a maximal rate during the period of exponential growth, which is marked on the graph by the letter C. The lag phase (choice A) is the initial phase of a bacterial culture during which there is no increase in cell number. Cells in a culture at this stage are activating enzymes necessary for metabolism, but are not undergoing cell wall synthesis. Choice B indicates the initial phase of bacterial multiplication, when cell division has not yet reached a maximum. Although cell wall synthesis would indeed make such cells sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics, it is not the period of maximum sensitivity. Choice D indicates the phase of the bacterial growth curve when toxic metabolic products begin to accumulate and nutrient levels begin to be insufficient to support continued growth. New cell wall synthesis would begin to fall at this point. The stationary phase (choice E) is a period of the bacterial growth curve when the number of bacteria dividing in the culture equals the number of cells dying. This would not be a period of intense cell wall synthesis. The decline (choice F) and death (choice G) phases of the bacterial growth curve are periods when bacteria are dying more rapidly than they are dividing. Cell wall synthesis would be minimal."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right upper quadrant pain and a fever. He also has had a 2-month history of chronic diarrhea and bloody stools. Physical examination shows a large, tender liver. Ultrasound shows an ovoid, hypoechoic lesion near the liver capsule. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the liver will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Image A (Toxoplasma gondii)",
      "B. Image B (Fasciola hepatica)",
      "C. Image C (Clonorchis sinensis ovum)",
      "D. Image D (Entamoeba histolytica trophozoite)",
      "E. Image E (Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts)"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal amebic parasite that either can cause relatively mild diarrhea or can behave more aggressively, causing dysentery (bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain and dehydration), peritonitis, or liver abscess formation (such as this patient has). Treatment is generally administered as soon as the diagnosis is made. Metronidazole is the drug of choice for the treatment of this infection due to its excellent tissue penetration. Metronidazole is effective for both invasive and luminal disease. However, upon successful completion of metronidazole therapy, a 'luminal agent' such as paromomycin or iodoquinol is administered to completely eradicate any remaining gastrointestinal tract infection and prevent an infection relapse. The trophozoite of E. histolytica, which is shown in the image, is identified by the distinctive 'cart-wheel' distribution of chromatin in the nucleus and the evidence of ingested red blood cells. Toxoplasma gondii (choice A) is a cause of encephalitis in the immunocompromised, and birth defects in children infected transplacentally, but is not a common cause of liver abscess or bloody diarrhea. The large tissue cyst shown here would be characteristic of an early active stage of disease or reactivation disease in the immunocompromised. Fasciola hepatica (choice B) is the sheep liver fluke. It can cause bile duct obstruction in infected humans but would not be a likely cause of bloody diarrhea or of liver abscess. It is very rare in the United States. The adult fluke, shown here, is identified by the prominent 'shoulders' on the anterior end. Clonorchis sinensis (choice C) is the Chinese liver fluke. It causes hepatitis and cholangitis in Chinese populations, but not bloody diarrhea or liver abscess. The ovum, which is shown here, is identified by the prominent opercular ridge on the far right of this image. Cryptosporidium parvum (choice E) is a protozoan parasite related to T. gondii. In humans it can cause chronic bloody diarrhea in the immunocompromised, but it is not a cause of liver abscess. The image shows a Giemsa stain of the oocysts that would be found in the stool. Diagnosis of this condition is normally made by acid-fast staining of the stool."

Physical examination shows a tender pinna, swelling and erythema of the external auditory canal, as well as a purulent discharge. The tympanic membrane cannot be visualized A CT scan of the head shows temporal bone erosions and new bone formation. Culture of the discharge will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gram-negative bacillus requiring factors X and V",
      "B. Gram-negative, oxidase-negative non-lactose fermenting bacillus",
      "C. Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus that produces blue-green pigments",
      "D. Gram-positive, catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic coccus",
      "E. Gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic coccus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has malignant external otitis, which is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of self-limited external otitis. It may, however, penetrate the epithelium and invade the underlying soft tissue, cartilage and bone, thus leading to osteomyelitis and cranial nerve palsies. The presenting symptoms include ear pain and discharge, hearing loss, and facial nerve paralysis. Abnormalities of the external ear canal are present. A CT scan may reveal bony erosions and soft-tissue swelling. Cultures will isolate the organism. Treatment includes antibiotics and surgical debridement. Malignant external otitis is most common in elderly diabetic patients. Pseudomonas is a genus of gram-negative bacilli that are oxidase-positive, aerobic, and produce blue-green pigments. Other diseases caused by Pseudomonas include septicemia, wound or burn infections, urinary tract infections in catheterized patients, and life-threatening pneumonias in cystic fibrosis patients. A gram-negative bacillus requiring factors X and V (choice A) describes the genus Haemophilus. This genus may cause otitis media; symptoms of otitis media include ear pain, fever and a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane. A gram-negative oxidase-negative, non-lactose fermenting bacillus (choice B) describes some members (Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, and Salmonella) of the family Enterobacteriaceae. There are no agents of ear infections present in this group. Most of the Enterobacteriaceae are diarrhea-causing agents, or are causes of enteric fevers, neonatal meningitis, or urinary tract infections. A gram-positive, catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic coccus (choice D) describes Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of otitis media but not of otitis externa, as in this case. A gram-positive catalase-negative beta-hemolytic coccus (choice E) describes Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae. S. pyogenes is a common cause of otitis media and S. agalactiae is the most common cause of neonatal septicemia and meningitis in the United States."

    "question": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a near-fatal fire. Over the next several days he develops pneumonia and progressive shortness of breath and is intubated. Gram stain of the sputum shows a gram-negative, encapsulated, oxidase-positive aerobic rod. Which of the following mechanisms allows the most likely causal organism to be resistant to many different antibiotics?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mutation of a penicillin-binding protein",
      "B. Mutation of a porin protein",
      "C. Mutation of a topoisomerase",
      "D. Plasmid-mediated acetyltransferase production",
      "E. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very common opportunist in burn patients, in whom it classically causes secondary wound infections and septicemia. It may also cause cystitis in patients with urinary catheters, and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. The organism is found in water and usually gains access to the body as a contaminant in the water used in respirators or in the water baths used to cleanse wounds. Pseudomonas is resistant to many antibiotics, and mutates to even more resistant strains during therapy. The most important means of resistance is through the mutation of a porin protein that restricts the flow of many antibiotics into the cell. Mutation of a penicillin-binding protein (choice A) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance exhibited by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mutation of a topoisomerase (choice C) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin that is exhibited by Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli. It is not, however considered the major mechanism of drug resistance to a wide variety of drugs. Plasmid-mediated acetyltransferase production (choice D) is a mechanism of drug resistance exhibited by Klebsiella and Enterobacter against gentamicin and by Salmonella against chloramphenicol. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production (choice E) is expressed in Pseudomonas and contributes to resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. It does not confer resistance to as many drugs as the alteration of the porin proteins, but is still a significant cause of resistance."

    "question": "A 2-week-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a one-day history of labored breathing. His home birth was uneventful and his immunizations are up-to-date but his mother reports that he developed conjunctivitis on the fourth day of life. He is afebrile and has a respiratory rate of 40/minute. Physical examination shows bilateral inspiratory crackles and a slight wheeze on auscultation of the chest. A chest x-ray is consistent with bilateral pneumonia. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 15,000/mm³ with 40% eosinophils. Which of the following is the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascaris lumbricoides",
      "B. Chlamydia trachomatis",
      "C. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "D. Mycoplasma pneumoniae",
      "E. Neisseria gonorrhoeae",
      "F. Pneumocystis jiroveci",
      "G. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "H. Varicella zoster virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient presents with symptoms consistent with neonatal atypical pneumonia secondary to Chlamydia trachomatis. This agent is transmitted from the mother's vaginal secretions to the neonate at birth. The conjunctivitis precedes the pneumonitis. Tachypnea, hypoxemia, crackles, wheezing and eosinophilia are evident. Patients with mild to moderate illness with Chlamydia pneumonia may present with the 'staccato cough' (inspiration between each single cough). Chest x-ray may show scattered infiltrates and hyperinflation of the lungs. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) produces ascariasis and can cause pneumonia and eosinophilia. This is caused by ingestion of Ascaris eggs from human fecal contamination. Haemophilus influenzae (choice C) is an agent of pharyngitis, pneumonia, meningitis and epiglottitis in unvaccinated children between the ages of 3 months and 2 years. It would not be common in a neonate and would not associate with eosinophilia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (choice D) is the most common etiologic agent of atypical pneumonia in young people, but not in neonates. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (choice E) can cause ophthalmia neonatorum in this age-group of patient but would not be associated with pneumonia or eosinophilia. Pneumocystis jiroveci (choice F) causes pneumonia in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other immunocompromised patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice G) is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in adults, but would not be a common agent of pneumonia with eosinophilia following conjunctivitis in a neonate. Varicella (choice H) pneumonia is accompanied by pruritic skin lesions. Eosinophilia is not seen."

    "options": [
      "A. Bordetella pertussis",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii)",
      "D. Respiratory syncytial virus",
      "E. Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The organism described is Pneumocystis jiroveci which is an opportunistic infection in premature infants and in patients with AIDS. It causes an atypical pneumonia due to the over-replication of type 2 pneumocytes and their production of surfactant-rich exudates, which fill the alveolar sacs and eventually cause death by asphyxiation. Bordetella pertussis (choice A) is the causative agent of whooping cough. The incidence of whooping cough has declined with the development of the vaccine. Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) is the causative agent of otitis media, epiglottitis, and meningitis in unvaccinated children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (choice D) would be a likely cause of respiratory distress in a premature infant, but the vignette describes the finding of spherical cysts with sharply outlined walls. RSV findings might indicate giant multinucleated cells or syncytia in the sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae (choice E) is the most common cause of otitis media and pneumonia, but not in premature infants."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the physician because of painful, tingling lesions on her tongue. Physical examination shows vesicular lesions with associated erythema on the tongue. She says that she is preparing for her wedding in a few days. Which of the following best describes the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. A double-stranded DNA virus that has a complex lipid envelope",
      "B. A double-stranded DNA virus that is enveloped and icosahedral",

      "D. A gram-positive, catalase-positive, beta-hemolytic coccus",
      "E. A positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is nonsegmented and naked"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The painful vesicular lesions on the tongue are characteristic of herpes simplex virus, and the most common strain that causes these lesions above the waist is herpes simplex type 1. Herpes simplex belongs to the Herpesviridae, which are double-stranded DNA viruses that are enveloped with nuclear membrane and are icosahedral. Stress is frequently an activating stimulus that causes herpes gingivostomatitis to break out from its location of latent infection in the ganglia. A double-stranded DNA virus that has a complex lipid envelope (choice A) describes the Poxviridae, a family that contains smallpox virus and molluscum contagiosum virus. Of these, smallpox virus is extinct and molluscum contagiosum is a common cause of benign, wartlike lesions in young adults. Molluscum does not cause vesicular lesions but rather umbilicated warts, and would not be common on the tongue. A gram-positive, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic coccus (choice C) describes either Streptococcus pyogenes or Strep. agalactiae. Of these, Strep. pyogenes does cause skin lesions (impetigo) in young children, but these are honey-crusted, not vesicular, and would not be common on the tongue in an adult. A gram-positive catalase-positive beta-hemolytic coccus (choice D) describes Staphylococcus aureus, which is another agent of impetigo in children. Staph. aureus causes bullous impetigo, characterized by vesicular lesions, but would not be common on the tongue. A positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is nonsegmented and naked (choice E) describes the family Picornaviridae which includes the agents of herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease. These coxsackieviruses cause blister-like lesions in the mouth but would not be common on the tongue. Hand, foot, and mouth disease presents with vesicular lesions in the front of the buccal mucosa, and herpangina manifests with lesions in the rear of the mouth on the palate and fauces."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This patient has mumps, which is caused by a negative-sense RNA virus in the Paramyxovirus family. This virus has been quite rare in the United States since the advent of the live-attenuated MMR vaccine. The mention of recent immigration suggests that the child may not have received adequate pediatric vaccinations or medical care. Bilateral parotitis and inflammation of the pancreas or testes are hallmarks of the infection in this age group. Other members of the Paramyxoviridae are parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles. The coronavirus family (choice A) includes corona virus and the SARS agent. The herpesvirus family (choice B) includes herpes simplex 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella zoster virus. The orthomyxovirus family (choice C) includes influenza virus. The reovirus family (choice E) includes rotavirus, reovirus, and Colorado tick fever virus."

Ketoacidotic diabetics are at risk for developing rhinocerebral infections following inhalation of the sporangiospores of these normally harmless bread molds. The fungi are identified by the nonseptate (ribbon-like) hyphae that branch at 90-degree angles. Arthroconidia and spherules (choices A and E) are the environmental form and diagnostic forms (respectively) of Coccidioides immitis, the causative agent of San Joaquin Valley fever. Monomorphic, encapsulated yeast (choice B) describes Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes meningitis in the immunocompromised. Septate hyphae branching at 45 degrees (choice D) describes Aspergillus, an opportunistic fungus that can cause sinus infections and spread to cause meningitis in the immunocompromised."

    "question": "A 38-year-old man with a history of hemophilia has had multiple infusions of clotting factors in his lifetime. Laboratory studies of ten batches of clotting factors administered to this patient show contamination with the human immunodeficiency virus, yet he has remained HIV-negative. The patient's CD4 count is 900/uL and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the virus is negative. Absence of which of the following cell surface receptors best explains the findings in this patient?",
    "options": ["A. CCR5", "B. CD4", "C. CD8", "D. Gp120", "E. TNF receptor"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection does not always progress to avert acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a few fortunate individuals (called nonprogressors) the infection remains asymptomatic, with a stable CD4 cell count and low or undetectable viremia. It is not entirely clear whether these patients will eventually develop AIDS. Some are resistant to HIV infection because they carry two defective copies of the gene encoding the CCR5 co-receptor. There are 15 known co-receptors, of which CCR5 and CXCR4 are the best characterized. CCR5 is a receptor for chemokines and serves as a co-receptor for HIV internalization into macrophages. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that serves as the co-receptor for HIV internalization into T lymphocytes. Approximately 1% of Caucasians in the United States are homozygous for such a protective CCR5 variant, and 20% are heterozygotes. HIV infection follows a slower course in heterozygotes. Homozygotes for this protective CCR5 variant are not present among Black and Asian populations. CD4 (choice B) is an important receptor of T-helper lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. It acts as the primary receptor for HIV binding. Binding to CD4, however, is not sufficient for the entry of HIV into the cells. Individuals without CD4 positive cells are defined as having a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and such a condition was not mentioned in the stem. The viral envelope gp120 protein (choice D) first binds CD4. This results in a conformational change in gp120 that allows this protein to bind co-receptors. Such co-receptors are present on lymphocytes and macrophages and normally serve as binding sites for chemokines. Once gp120 binds to CD4 and a co-receptor, a second viral protein gp41 facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, allowing 'injection' of the viral core into the cell. Neither CD8 (choice C) nor the receptor for TNF (choice E) plays a role in HIV binding to cells. CD8 is the co-receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes that stabilizes the interaction between the T cell receptor and the major histocompatibility molecule. The TNF receptor is a molecule on T lymphocytes that receives stimulatory signals from macrophages or in other cases receives apoptotic signals in various cells."

Which of the following diseases did this patient most likely have at 1 year of age?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mumps",
      "B. Parvovirus B19",
      "C. Polio",
      "D. Rubella",
      "E. Rubeola"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This child had subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is a very rare, late complication of measles (rubeola) infection at an early age. The existence of this complication is part of the rationale for immunizing children against measles at an early age. It is thought that the immune and neurologic systems of very young children may permit the virus to become established in the brain. The exact mechanism of injury is poorly understood, but the brain shows encephalitis involving both gray and white matter. Forty percent of cases die within 1 year, and it is thought that the disease is probably always eventually fatal. Mumps (choice A) causes parotitis and fever in young children, and causes the complications of pancreatitis and orchitis when older individuals acquire the infection. Mumps is not known to cause CNS pathology. Parvovirus B19 (choice B) causes erythema infectiosum, or slapped-cheek fever in school-age children, and hydrops fetalis in fetuses infected in utero. It is also associated with aplastic crises in sickle-cell anemia patients, but is not known to cause CNS pathology. Polio (choice C) spreads from the blood to the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and motor cortex of the brain. It causes an asymmetric flaccid paralysis without sensory loss. Spasticity is not a common finding in polio. Rubella (choice D) or German measles, causes a mild 3-day rash in adults but is known to be teratogenic in the fetus if a mother is infected during gestation. The syndrome in the neonate (congenital rubella syndrome) includes patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, cataracts, microcephaly, and deafness."

      "D. 600-799 cells/mm³",
      "E. Above 800 cells/mm³"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has progressed from being asymptomatic to the point that he has a condition attributed to HIV infection, but not an AIDS-defining condition. The most likely CD4 count associated with this stage of disease would be between 200 and 399 cells/mm³. A CD4 cell count of 0-199 (choice A) would be the expected count in a patient who has progressed to full-blown AIDS. Full-blown AIDS is defined by the presence of a variety of infections or conditions that demonstrate a life-threatening collapse of the immune system. Examples of such conditions would include HIV encephalopathy, Pneumocystis pneumonia, Kaposi sarcoma, cryptosporidiosis, or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. A CD4 cell count of 400-599 (choice C) is a range that would be associated with a finding of generalized lymphadenopathy or asymptomatic infection. The existence of thrush in the present patient indicates that he has progressed to the early symptomatic phase of the disease. A CD4 cell count in the range of 600-799 (choice D) would be expected in an asymptomatic patient without generalized lymphadenopathy or thrush. A CD4 cell count above 800 (choice E) is considered a normal value in an uninfected individual."

      "D. Paracoccidioidomycosis",
      "E. Sporotrichosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Latin America and multiply-budding ('pilot's wheel') yeasts are clues for paracoccidioidomycosis. This disease is caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Blastomycosis (choice A) results in large budding yeasts in the sputum. It is found in the great riverbeds of the eastern half of the United States, with North and South Carolina being especially highly endemic. It causes acute and chronic lung infections as well as disseminated disease and is a special problem in the immunocompromised person. Coccidioidomycosis (choice B) is a fungus of the U.S. desert southwest. It also causes acute and chronic pulmonary infections, disseminated infections, and cutaneous lesions, but the tissue form would be spherules with endospores. Histoplasmosis (choice C) is endemic along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio river valleys of the United States. It causes acute and chronic pulmonary infections and disseminated infections in the immunocompromised. The tissue form is an intracellular, unencapsulated yeast. Sporotrichosis (choice E) causes skin lesions in rose gardeners that may be single cutaneous mycetomas or may follow lymphatic drainages. The tissue form is a cigar-shaped yeast."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of pain on swallowing. Physical examination shows white, plague-like material that is easily scraped off from the tongue and on the buccal mucosa. Which of the following laboratory tests is most appropriate to confirm the identity of the causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. CAMP test",
      "B. ELEK test",
      "C. Germ-tube test",
      "D. Heterophile antibody test",
      "E. Weil-Felix test"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Candida albicans produces oral thrush, which is common in acute HIV disease and becomes increasingly common as the CD4+ cell count falls. Candida plaques can generally be scraped off easily while those in a similar condition in HIV-infected individuals, hairy leukoplakia, cannot. Diagnosis is by demonstration of pseudohyphae formation in animal serum, the basis of the germ-tube test. The CAMP test (choice A) is used to identify a partial hemolytic agent produced by Streptococcus agalactiae. It is used to distinguish between group A and group B streptococci, along with testing for bacitracin sensitivity. Group B streptococci cause neonatal meningitis and septicemia, not the oral lesions described here. The ELEK test (choice B) is used to identify toxin-producing strains of bacteria in the oropharynx that resemble Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is used to differentiate between the pathogen C. diphtheriae and normal flora diphtheroids. C. diphtheriae causes gray fibrinous exudates to form on the uvula and upper airways. It does not have an association with HIV infection. Heterophile antibody tests (choice D) are common in medicine in cases in which a causal agent is difficult to identify or culture. These tests depend on the detection of accidental cross-reactions between antibodies formed during an infection with an unrelated substance. Key examples of heterophile antibody tests include the Monospot test for Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis, the Weil-Felix test for rickettsial infections, and the VDRL for syphilis. None of these tests would be used to identify the cause of a white oral exudate in an AIDS patient. The Weil-Felix test (choice E) is a heterophile antibody test used in the diagnosis of several rickettsial diseases. It depends on the accidental cross-reaction between antibodies produced during rickettsial infections and the OX strain of Proteus vulgaris. Rickettsial diseases are arthropod-borne diseases that are all characterized by rashes. None of them would be consistent with the signs in this case."

    "question": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive muscular weakness and poor head control. The mother says that she feeds the boy a soy-based formula sweetened with honey. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is ingestion of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. A gram-positive vegetative bacillus",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Exotoxin",
      "D. Meurotoxin",
      "E. Spores"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This baby has infant botulism (floppy-baby syndrome), which is due to germination of Clostridium botulinum spores in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. This disorder is most common in children under the age of 6 months. Older children and adults do not appear to be vulnerable to this form of botulism, but are susceptible to botulism caused by ingestion of preformed toxin. Floppy-baby syndrome is acquired following the ingestion of spores of the organism. Honey is a known source of C. botulinum spores.\nA gram-positive vegetative bacillus (choice A) describes C botulinum, but it is not ingestion of the vegetative bacteria that causes this condition.\nEndotoxin (choice B), or lipopolysaccharide, is found on all gram-negative bacteria; and C botulinum is a gram-positive rod.\nExotoxin (choice C) could describe any secreted toxin, including neurotoxins, but again, this infant's condition was not an intoxication and was not due to ingestion of any kind of toxin directly.\nA neurotoxin (choice D) describes tetanospasmin or botulinum toxin, which is produced by C tetani or C. botulinum, respectively. Tetanus toxin causes a rigid paralysis due to the inhibition of glycine and GABA at inhibitory synapses. The present case is one of infant botulism, which was not due to ingestion of a preformed toxin or an intoxication, as is adult botulism."

    "question": "Public Health authorities are notified of an outbreak of diarrhea with leukocytes, blood and mucus at a day-care center in Minnesota. Of the 14 affected children within the ages of 3 to 5 years old, all had fever, leukocytosis and pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. What is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Helicobacter pylori",
      "B. Salmonella enterica subspecies typhi",
      "C. Streptococcus pneumoniae",
      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Yersinia enterocolitica"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Yersinia enterocolitica is an important cause of \"mini-epidemics\" of pediatric diarrhea. Outbreaks are common in colder climates (like Minnesota) and the organism can be grown well at 4°C (39°F). Adults can also be affected, but less commonly than children. Infection often causes fever, diarrhea (which can be bloody with leukocytes and mucus), and abdominal pain, particularly right lower quadrant pain mimicking appendicitis (pseudoappendicitis). This presentation fits the day-care outbreak described.\nHelicobacter pylori (choice A) is an important cause of gastritis and ulcers.\nSalmonella enterica subspecies typhi (choice B) causes typhoid fever. It is not common in the United States, but symptoms of infection include fever, abdominal rash, and splenomegaly. Diarrhea is not a consistent feature.\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (choice C) usually causes respiratory infections rather than diarrhea.\nVibrio cholerae (choice D) causes cholera. It is not a common cause of diarrhea in day-care centers in the United States but is normally associated with massive environmental doses of bacteria in contaminated water. Patients with cholera have severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."

    "question": "Several employees at a large company come fo employee health services because of a 2-day history of multiple episodes of watery diarrhea. Some have had blood-tinged stools and some have had profound abdominal cramping and fever. All the affected individuals attended a dinner party several days ago. An overnight stool culture at 42°C (107 6°F) grows microaerophilic, oxidase-positive, gram-negative, curved rods with polar flagella. Which of the following is the most likely source of this infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. \"Carrier\" food handlers",
      "B. Custard and potato-salad dishes",
      "C. Milk and cream",
      "D. Poorly canned green vegetables",
      "E. Poorly washed salad greens",
      "F. Poultry dishes",
      "G. Rare red meat dishes",
      "H. Rice dishes",
      "I. Smoked fish",
      "J. Soft cheeses"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This case history (inflammatory diarrhea, fever, cramping after a shared meal) and culture characteristics (growth at 42°C, microaerophilic, oxidase-positive, gram-negative curved rods) describe a typical gastroenteritis due to Campylobacter jejuni, the most common bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. Contaminated poultry or poultry products are responsible for more than 50% of all infections.\nCarriers (choice A) are not known to occur with Campylobacter, and are best known with Salmonella typhi - Typhoid fever is an enteric fever that presents with fever, lymphadenopathy and constipation.\nCustard and potato-salad dishes (choice B) would be the most likely source if the agent was Staphylococcus aureus, but this would have had an onset of 2 hours, and a gram-positive coccus would have been the cause.\nMilk and cream (choice C) might contain Listeria or Mycobacterium bovis, but Listeria is a gram-positive rod and Mycobacterium is an acid-fast rod. Both may cause a minor gastroenteritis in healthy adults but would be unlikely to present with blood in the stool.\nPoorly canned green vegetables (choice D) are the usual source of Clostridium botulinum which would cause a flaccid paralysis. Clostridium is a genus of gram-positive rods.\nPoorly washed salad greens (choice E) could be sources of infection with multiple agents such as Escherichia coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella, or Shigella. The E coli strains which cause non-bloody diarrhea are usually associated with travel out of the home country (traveler's diarrhea). E coli is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-negative. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that does not occur commonly in the United States but instead requires travel to a tropical country, and Salmonella and Shigella would be more likely to cause frankly bloody stools. Both are gram-negative rods that are oxidase-negative.\nRare red meat dishes (choice G) would be good sources for Escherichia coli or Trichinella spiralis. E.coli is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod and Trichinella is a nematode. The serotype of E coli associated with rare meat dishes in the United States causes bloody diarrhea without leukocytes. Trichinosis causes myalgia, fever, eosinophilia, splinter hemorrhages and periorbital edema.\nRice dishes (choice H) are most frequently incriminated in the transmission of Bacillus cereus which has a 1-to-2-hour onset of vomiting followed by diarrhea. Bacillus is a genus of gram-positive rods.\nSmoked fish (choice I) is a common source of Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, spore-forming rod that would produce a flaccid paralysis.\nSoft cheeses (choice J) are a common source of Listeria monocytogenes which is a gram-positive rod that causes mild gastroenteritis."

    "question": "A healthy 32-year-old primigravid woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal examination. She states that she emigrated from Southeast Asia and that three years ago, she had fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice, joint pains, and generalized skin lesions that slowly disappeared. Which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered to investigate the patient's past illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibody",
      "B. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) Ig antibody",
      "C. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)",
      "D. IgM antibody to HBcAg",
      "E. IgM antibody to HBsAg"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical signs from three years ago (fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice, arthralgias, rash) are suggestive of acute hepatitis B infection. Since she recovered, she could either have cleared the virus completely or become a chronic carrier. Given that she is now pregnant and from an endemic area (Southeast Asia), it is crucial to determine her current Hepatitis B status, primarily to assess the risk of perinatal transmission to the newborn. Testing for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) will determine if she is currently infected (either acutely or chronically). If HBsAg is positive, she is infectious. Further tests (e.g., HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBV DNA) would clarify the level of infectivity and chronicity, and guide management (e.g., infant prophylaxis). CMV IgG (A) would only indicate past exposure to CMV. HAV testing (B) is irrelevant to these past symptoms. Anti-HBc IgM (D) would indicate acute infection within the last ~6 months, unlikely here. Anti-HBs IgM (E) is not a standard diagnostic marker."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man is struck by a car and sustains crush injuries to both legs. Two days later, he develops a severe infection of the legs. Physical examination shows crepitus of the tissue of the legs. An x-ray of the legs shows radiolucent pockets in the soft tissues. Which of the following toxins produced by the most likely causal organism is responsible for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Enterotoxin",
      "D. Meurotoxin",
      "E. Superantigen toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The disease described is gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), a rapidly progressive, life-threatening infection of muscle tissue, typically following trauma or surgery. The presence of crepitus (gas in tissues) and radiolucent pockets on X-ray confirms gas production. The most common causative agent is Clostridium perfringens, an anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacillus found in soil and the gut. C. perfringens produces multiple toxins, but the alpha toxin (a phospholipase C or lecithinase) is considered the major virulence factor responsible for the extensive tissue destruction (myonecrosis), hemolysis, and systemic toxicity seen in gas gangrene. Gas production results from bacterial fermentation of tissue carbohydrates.\nEndotoxin (choice B) is lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria.\nEnterotoxins (choice C) cause diarrhea (C. perfringens also produces an enterotoxin causing food poisoning, but that's different from the alpha toxin causing gangrene).\nNeurotoxins (choice D) are produced by C. tetani and C. botulinum.\nSuperantigen toxin (choice E) causes toxic shock syndrome (S. aureus, S. pyogenes)."

Physical examination shows multiple umbilicated, flesh-colored papules on the trunk. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. It captures a nuclear membrane envelope",
      "B. It replicates in the cytoplasm",
      "C. It replicates in the nucleus",
      "D. It utilizes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase",
      "E. It utilizes reverse transcriptase"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The lesions described (umbilicated, flesh-colored papules) are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum, a common, benign viral skin infection caused by the Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), which is a member of the Poxviridae family. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses because they replicate entirely within the cytoplasm of the host cell, using their own viral enzymes for DNA replication and transcription. They form characteristic large, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (molluscum bodies or Henderson-Paterson bodies).\nCapturing a nuclear membrane envelope (choice A) and replication in the nucleus (choice C) are characteristics of Herpesviridae.\nUtilization of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (choice D) is characteristic of RNA viruses (except retroviruses).\nUtilization of reverse transcriptase (choice E) is characteristic of retroviruses (like HIV) and hepadnaviruses (like HBV)."

Examination of the discharge under a microscope shows fungal hyphae and yeast forms. Which of the following is most likely to predispose the patient to this condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Crohn disease",
      "B. Diabetes mellitus",
      "C. Disseminated gonococcal infection",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), commonly known as a yeast infection. The symptoms (itching) and signs (white, lumpy 'cottage cheese' discharge, presence of yeast/hyphae on microscopy) are typical. Candida albicans is the most common cause. Several factors predispose women to VVC, including antibiotic use, pregnancy, use of high-estrogen oral contraceptives, immunosuppression, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Diabetes increases the risk likely due to hyperglycemia (which may increase vaginal glucose levels, promoting yeast growth) and possibly impaired neutrophil function.\nCrohn disease (choice A) is not a direct risk factor. Disseminated gonococcal infection (C) is a bacterial infection. Rheumatoid arthritis (D) and SLE (E) are autoimmune diseases; while immunosuppressive treatments for these could increase risk, the diseases themselves are not primary predisposing factors like diabetes."

    "options": [
      "A. Ground beef",
      "B. Poultry",
      "C. Rice",
      "D. Salad greens",
      "E. Vacuum-packed fish"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This is a typical presentation of foodborne botulism, caused by ingestion of preformed botulinum neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Symptoms include descending flaccid paralysis, starting with cranial nerves (diplopia, ptosis, diminished pupillary reflex, dysphagia, dysarthria) and progressing to respiratory failure. C. botulinum is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium found in soil. Spores can contaminate foods, and if conditions are anaerobic (e.g., improper canning, vacuum packing) and non-acidic, the spores can germinate and produce toxin. Home-canned low-acid vegetables (like green beans), preserved fish (especially smoked or vacuum-packed), and preserved meats are classic sources. Commercial canning is generally safe. Honey is a source for infant botulism (spore ingestion), not adult foodborne botulism.\nGround beef (A) is associated with E. coli O157:H7. Poultry (B) is associated with Salmonella and Campylobacter. Rice (C) is associated with Bacillus cereus."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The teacher presents with acute symmetric polyarthritis affecting the small joints of the hands and wrists, mimicking rheumatoid arthritis but self-limited. This presentation in an adult, particularly one working with children (like a schoolteacher), is highly suggestive of Parvovirus B19 infection. While Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease, 'slapped cheek' rash) in children, adults often present primarily with arthralgia/arthritis, sometimes accompanied by mild flu-like symptoms or a faint rash. The arthritis typically resolves within a few weeks.\nHuman herpesvirus type 6 (A) causes roseola infantum (high fever followed by rash) in young children. Rubella (C) causes fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy; arthritis can occur but the presentation is less typical. Rubeola (D, measles) causes cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and rash. Varicella zoster virus (E) causes chickenpox (vesicular rash) or shingles."

He has a history of fungal esophagitis and cervical lymphadenopathy. In the United States, which of the following is the most common means of transmission of the causal agent responsible for the CT findings?",
    "options": [

    "explanation": "The patient, with a history suggesting immunodeficiency (fungal esophagitis, likely related to AIDS), presents with seizures, altered mental status, focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis), and characteristic ring-enhancing lesions on CT scan. This is highly suggestive of cerebral toxoplasmosis, caused by reactivation of latent Toxoplasma gondii infection in an immunocompromised host. Humans typically acquire primary Toxoplasma infection by either ingesting tissue cysts in undercooked or raw meat (pork, lamb, venison are common sources - part of the contaminated meat supply) or by ingesting oocysts shed in the feces of infected cats (fecal-oral contamination, choice B). While both routes occur, ingestion of contaminated meat is considered the most common source of human infection in many developed countries, including the US. Respiratory (C) and sexual (D) transmission do not occur. Transplacental transmission (E) causes congenital toxoplasmosis."

      "C. Hfr to F- conjugation",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is naturally competent, meaning it can readily take up naked DNA from its environment (transformation). Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae is primarily mediated by alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting from mutations in the PBP genes. These altered PBP genes can be transferred between pneumococci via transformation. When susceptible pneumococci lyse (e.g., due to autolysins or immune clearance), they release DNA fragments containing these resistance genes. Competent neighboring pneumococci can then take up this DNA and incorporate it into their own genome via homologous recombination, acquiring resistance. This process allows for the rapid spread of resistance within a population under antibiotic pressure, as seen in the nursing home outbreak. Conjugation (A, C) and transduction (B, D) are less common or established mechanisms for PBP-mediated resistance transfer in pneumococci compared to transformation."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The patient is an older woman with alcoholism presenting with symptoms of severe pneumonia. The sputum culture grows gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rods, which strongly suggests Klebsiella pneumoniae (other possibilities like E. coli are less common causes of severe community-acquired pneumonia). Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia classically affects individuals with alcoholism, diabetes, or chronic lung disease. It typically causes a lobar pneumonia, often involving the upper lobes, and is characterized by extensive inflammation, necrosis, and abscess formation, frequently leading to cavitation visible on chest X-ray. The production of thick, mucoid, often bloody sputum ('currant jelly') is also characteristic. Aspergilloma (A) is a fungus ball in a pre-existing cavity. Ghon complex (B) is primary TB. Interstitial pattern (C) suggests atypical pneumonia. Mediastinal widening (D) suggests anthrax or lymphoma/mass."

SSPE is a rare, fatal, progressive neurological disorder caused by a persistent, defective measles virus infection of the central nervous system. It typically occurs years (average 6-10) after primary measles infection, often contracted at a young age (<2 years). The defective virus persists in the brain, causing chronic inflammation and demyelination. Mumps (B) and Varicella (E) can cause post-infectious encephalomyelitis, but not typically SSPE.

This points towards a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, with Staphylococcus epidermidis being the most common species causing such infections. To differentiate S. epidermidis from another common coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. saprophyticus (often associated with UTIs in young women), the novobiocin susceptibility test is used. S. epidermidis is susceptible to novobiocin, while S. saprophyticus is resistant. Bacitracin resistance (A) helps differentiate Streptococcus species. Catalase production (B) differentiates Staphylococcus (+) from Streptococcus (-). Coagulase production (C) differentiates S. aureus (+) from coagulase-negative staphylococci (-). Optochin resistance (E) helps differentiate Streptococcus species."

    "question": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of muscle and joint pain for the past few weeks. She says that she has remained active despite the pain and continues to walk her two dogs in the local wooded park. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies are pending. The patient, however, does not return for a follow-up examination. Three months later, she develops dyspnea and palpitations. An ECG shows first-degree heart block. Which of the following is the most likely vector of her disease?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aedes aegypti",
      "B. Anopheles gambiae",
      "C. Ixodes scapularis",
      "D. Pediculus humanus",
      "E. Xenopsylla cheopis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient initially presents with nonspecific symptoms (myalgias, arthralgias) possibly related to early Lyme disease, followed months later by a cardiac manifestation (first-degree heart block), which is a known complication of Lyme carditis. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by the bite of Ixodes species ticks (I. scapularis in the eastern and midwestern US, I. pacificus in the western US), commonly known as deer ticks. Walking dogs in wooded areas increases exposure risk. Aedes mosquitoes (A) transmit dengue, Zika, etc. Anopheles mosquitoes (B) transmit malaria. Pediculus humanus (D, body louse) transmits epidemic typhus, trench fever, relapsing fever (B. recurrentis). Xenopsylla cheopis (E, rat flea) transmits plague."

Physical examination shows a small papule and a healing scratch on the left arm. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of a lymph node shows stellate granulomas with small, gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?",
    "options": [
      "A. Camping",
      "B. Exploring caves",
      "C. Gardening",
      "D. New cats in the household",
      "E. Traveling outside the United States"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with regional lymphadenopathy (axillary node) following a scratch, accompanied by fever and an inoculation papule. Lymph node biopsy shows stellate (star-shaped) necrotizing granulomas containing gram-negative bacilli. This constellation of findings is highly characteristic of Cat-Scratch Disease (CSD), caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. Cats, particularly kittens, are the primary reservoir for B. henselae, and the infection is typically transmitted to humans via scratches or bites. Therefore, acquiring new cats or kittens is a common historical factor associated with CSD. Camping in Arizona (A) might suggest coccidioidomycosis or plague. Exploring caves (B) risks histoplasmosis. Gardening (C) risks Sporothrix schenckii. Traveling (E) depends on the destination."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation (fever, headache, nuchal rigidity) and CSF findings (high neutrophils, high protein, low glucose) indicate acute bacterial meningitis. In a 65-year-old adult, the most common cause of bacterial meningitis is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). A critical virulence factor for S. pneumoniae, enabling it to cause invasive disease like meningitis and pneumonia, is its polysaccharide capsule. The capsule is antiphagocytic, protecting the bacterium from opsonization and phagocytosis by host immune cells, thus allowing it to survive and proliferate in the bloodstream and CSF. While S. pneumoniae produces pneumolysin (a cytolysin/exotoxin - B, D), IgA protease, and other factors, the capsule is considered the most important virulence factor for invasive disease. Endotoxin (C) is specific to gram-negative bacteria. S. pneumoniae is an extracellular pathogen (E)."

Examination of fissue obiained on biopsy of the brain shows multiple cystlike structures. Cultures of the lesions are negative. Which of the following is the best explanation for the syndrome in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Infected whole-blood transfusion",
      "B. Ingestion of cysts in poorly cooked pork",
      "C. Ingestion of oocysts from cat feces",
      "D. Reactivation of latent infection",
      "E. Transplant of an infected organ"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient is immunosuppressed due to her heart transplant and anti-rejection medications. She presents with neurological symptoms and ring-enhancing brain lesions on CT, with biopsy showing cysts but negative cultures. This is highly suggestive of cerebral toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasma infection is very common worldwide, with most immunocompetent individuals developing a latent infection characterized by dormant tissue cysts (bradyzoites) in the brain, muscle, and other tissues. In immunocompromised individuals (like transplant recipients), these latent cysts can reactivate, leading to tachyzoite proliferation and symptomatic disease, most commonly presenting as encephalitis with ring-enhancing lesions. Therefore, reactivation of a latent infection acquired earlier in life is the most likely explanation. While primary infection can occur via ingestion of cysts (B) or oocysts (C), reactivation is far more common in this setting. Transmission via transfusion (A) or the transplanted organ (E) is possible but less likely than reactivation of a prevalent latent infection."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The most common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis (presenting with tachypnea, irritability, positive blood culture) is Group B Streptococcus (GBS), Streptococcus agalactiae. GBS typically appears as gram-positive cocci in chains (characteristic of streptococci). A key laboratory characteristic of S. agalactiae is that it usually produces beta-hemolysis (complete lysis of red blood cells) on blood agar, although the zone may be narrow or hemolysis weak. It is also catalase-negative (ruling out Staphylococcus - B, C, E) and CAMP test positive. Growth in bile (D) is characteristic of Enterococcus species."

His mother states that she did not receive prenatal care during her pregnancy. Physical examination of the newborn shows a diminished sucking reflex, which was normal at birth. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows a mononuclear pleocytosis and elevated protein levels. A PCR test of the CSF is completed, but the results are pending. An MRI of the brain is performed, which shows abnormalities in the temporal lobes bilaterally. Which of the following is the most important factor in the development of this infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. Absence of antibodies in the mother",
      "B. Exposure of the mother to poorly cooked pork",
      "C. Passage through an infected birth canal",
      "D. Three-day rash in the mother",
      "E. Transplacental transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The neonate presents with symptoms of encephalitis (fever, seizures, lethargy/diminished suck) at 10 days of life. CSF shows mononuclear pleocytosis (suggesting viral or possibly Listeria infection), and MRI reveals characteristic temporal lobe abnormalities. This clinical and imaging picture is highly suggestive of neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis. HSV infection in neonates is most commonly acquired intrapartum, during passage through an infected maternal birth canal (usually HSV-2, but can be HSV-1), especially if the mother has a primary genital herpes infection near the time of delivery. Transplacental transmission (E) can occur but is less common than intrapartum transmission for HSV encephalitis presenting after the first few days. Absence of maternal antibodies (A) might increase risk but isn't the mode of transmission. Pork exposure (B) relates to Toxoplasma. 3-day rash (D) relates to Rubella."

    "explanation": "This scenario describes an outbreak of pharyngoconjunctival fever in a summer camp setting, strongly associated with swimming pool use. Pharyngoconjunctival fever is characterized by the triad of pharyngitis (sore throat), conjunctivitis (often follicular or keratoconjunctivitis), and fever, often accompanied by headache, cough, and malaise. Adenoviruses are well-known causes of such outbreaks, transmitted via respiratory droplets, fomites, or contaminated water (including inadequately chlorinated swimming pools). Chlamydia (B) causes different syndromes. Enterococcus (C) causes UTIs/endocarditis. Herpesviruses (D) like EBV cause mononucleosis. Neisseria (E) causes meningitis or gonorrhea."

Which of the following is most likely to occur during this patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arthus reaction",
      "B. Cytotoxic hypersensitivity",
      "C. Mast cell degranulation",
      "D. Neutrophilia",
      "E. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The patient, after handling a deer carcass in an endemic area (Oklahoma), develops symptoms suggestive of tularemia, caused by Francisella tularensis. While the ulceroglandular form (with skin lesion) is most common, pneumonic tularemia can occur after inhalation or hematogenous spread, presenting with fever, cough, dyspnea, and lymphadenopathy. Francisella is a facultative intracellular bacterium that primarily infects macrophages. Host defense relies critically on cell-mediated immunity, involving activated macrophages and T lymphocytes (Th1 response). This immune response manifests pathologically as granuloma formation in infected tissues (like lymph nodes and lungs). Granuloma formation is the hallmark of a Type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction. Arthus reaction (A) is Type III. Cytotoxic hypersensitivity (B) is Type II. Mast cell degranulation (C) is Type I or involved in parasite immunity. Neutrophilia (D) is typical of extracellular bacterial infections."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with severe atypical pneumonia (high fever, prominent systemic symptoms like headache/myalgia, initial non-productive cough progressing rapidly to respiratory failure) requiring mechanical ventilation. The key laboratory finding is the growth of the organism on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar, which is the specific selective medium required for the isolation of Legionella species. Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, often acquired from contaminated water sources (e.g., cooling towers, plumbing systems). Chlamydia pneumoniae (A) causes atypical pneumonia but requires cell culture. Haemophilus influenzae (B), Staphylococcus aureus (E), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (F) cause typical bacterial pneumonia and grow on standard media (chocolate or blood agar). Listeria (D) primarily causes meningitis/sepsis, not typically pneumonia."

This infant presented with skin lesions followed by severe CNS involvement (seizures, palsies, lethargy) leading to death, fitting the pattern of neonatal HSV encephalitis or disseminated disease. HSV is usually acquired intrapartum. CMV (A) causes blueberry muffin rash, calcifications, hearing loss. Rubella (C) causes cataracts, heart defects, deafness.

      "C. Production of a hyaluronic acid capsule",
      "D. Production of an IgA protease",
      "E. Production of an M protein"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation and CSF findings (high neutrophils, high protein, low glucose, gram-positive cocci in pairs - diplococci) are classic for bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). S. pneumoniae initially colonizes the nasopharynx. One mechanism facilitating this colonization is the production of an IgA protease. Secretory IgA (sIgA) is the primary antibody protecting mucosal surfaces. S. pneumoniae IgA protease cleaves human IgA1 (the predominant subclass in the respiratory tract) in the hinge region, separating the Fab (antigen-binding) and Fc (effector) portions. This inactivation of sIgA hinders mucosal immunity and promotes bacterial adherence and colonization. C carbohydrate (A) is used for Lancefield grouping (pneumococcus is ungroupable). Pneumolysin (B) is a toxin but involved more in tissue damage. Hyaluronic acid capsule (C) is produced by S. pyogenes. M protein (E) is characteristic of S. pyogenes."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient is a chronic smoker presenting with symptoms suggestive of chronic bronchitis or an exacerbation. The Gram stain finding of gram-negative coccobacilli in the sputum is characteristic of Haemophilus influenzae. Non-typeable (unencapsulated) strains of H. influenzae are common colonizers of the respiratory tract and are frequent causes of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media, and sinusitis, particularly in smokers and those with underlying lung disease. Chlamydophila (A) and Mycoplasma (E) do not Gram stain. Legionella (C) stains poorly. Moraxella catarrhalis (D) is another common cause of bronchitis exacerbations in smokers, but it typically appears as gram-negative diplococci, not coccobacilli."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Listeriosis during pregnancy, caused by Listeria monocytogenes, can manifest as a nonspecific febrile illness (flu-like symptoms, diarrhea) in the mother. Transplacental transmission to the fetus can lead to a severe disseminated infection known as granulomatosis infantiseptica. This condition is characterized by widespread microabscesses and granulomas in multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, lungs, and brain, and often results in preterm delivery, stillbirth, or early neonatal death. E. coli (A) causes neonatal sepsis/meningitis. HSV-2 (B) causes SEM disease, encephalitis, or disseminated disease, typically without widespread granulomas.

      "D. The gene in the sequence closest to oriT encodes vancomycin resistance",
      "E. The gene in the sequence farthest from the tra operon encodes ampicillin resistance"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "In Hfr conjugation, the bacterial chromosome is transferred linearly starting from the origin of transfer (oriT) within the integrated F factor. Genes closer to oriT are transferred earlier and more frequently than genes farther away. The transfer frequency decreases with distance from oriT. The tra operon, responsible for conjugation machinery, is part of the F factor and is typically transferred last, if at all. Therefore, the highest frequency of transfer corresponds to the gene closest to oriT, and the lowest frequency corresponds to the gene farthest from oriT (closest to the tra operon end). Here, ampicillin resistance is transferred most frequently (95%), indicating it is closest to oriT and thus farthest from the tra operon. Vancomycin resistance is transferred least frequently (45%), indicating it is farthest from oriT and closest to the tra operon.\nChoice A describes transduction. Choice B describes F+ conjugation. Choice C is imprecise; the genes are chromosomal, mobilized by the integrated episome. Choice D is incorrect; vancomycin is farthest from oriT. Choice E correctly states that ampicillin resistance (transferred most frequently, hence closest to oriT) is farthest from the tra operon."

Doxycycline is the drug of choice for treating RMSF in both adults and children. The patient has renal failure, which is important when choosing among tetracyclines. Doxycycline is primarily eliminated via the biliary/fecal route and does not require dose adjustment in renal impairment. Other tetracyclines (demeclocycline, methacycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline) are mainly eliminated renally and can accumulate in patients with renal failure, potentially worsening azotemia and causing toxicity.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This neonate has late-onset bacterial meningitis (occurring after the first week of life). The CSF findings (high neutrophils, gram-positive cocci in chains) indicate infection with a Streptococcus species. Group B Streptococcus (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) is the leading cause of both early- and late-onset neonatal meningitis. Key laboratory characteristics differentiating GBS from other streptococci include beta-hemolysis (often narrow zone), resistance to bacitracin, and a positive CAMP test. The CAMP test detects a synergistic hemolytic effect when GBS is grown near Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in an arrowhead-shaped zone of enhanced hemolysis. Alpha-hemolysis (A) and optochin sensitivity (E) describe S. pneumoniae. Bacitracin sensitivity (B) describes S. pyogenes. Growth on bile-esculin (D) describes Enterococcus and Group D Strep."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Conjugation involving donation of plasmids from an F+ bacterium to an F- recipient bacterium is the only means of DNA transfer listed that does not require homologous recombination (mediated by RecA protein) for stable inheritance of the transferred genetic material. The F plasmid transferred during F+ to F- conjugation is capable of autonomous replication in the recipient cell. In contrast, Hfr conjugation (C), generalized transduction (B), specialized transduction (D), and transformation (E) all typically involve the transfer of linear DNA fragments that must be integrated into the recipient chromosome via RecA-dependent homologous recombination to be stably maintained and passed on to progeny. Therefore, a recA-deficient strain can act as a recipient in F+ to F- conjugation but would be deficient as a recipient in the other processes."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The Ghon complex is the most frequent pathologic form of primary pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis first localizes in the lung parenchyma (Ghon focus), then spreads to the draining hilar lymph nodes. In both of these locations, a granulomatous reaction takes place, often with central caseation necrosis. The presence of this complex (peripheral lung lesion + hilar node involvement) with caseating granulomas containing acid-fast bacilli indicates an active primary infection, even if asymptomatic or discovered incidentally. Disseminated infection (A, miliary TB) involves widespread seeding. Reactivation disease (C) typically affects lung apices. Re-exposure disease (D) might lead to reactivation. Remote healed infection (E) would show fibrotic or calcified lesions, usually without active caseation or detectable bacilli."

    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of a fever, fatigue, and diminished mental acuity. He recently returned from a 5-day trip to Southeast Asia, where he was a news correspondent. Over the next several days, he develops progressive hemolytic anemia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. He lapses into a coma. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Babesia microti",
      "B. Plasmodium falciparum",
      "C. Plasmodium malariae",
      "D. Plasmodium ovale",
      "E. Plasmodium vivax"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Most forms of malaria cause chronic disease with significant morbidity and mortality. The most serious is malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (sometimes still called malignant tertian malaria), which has a propensity for being severe and having life-threatening complications including severe anemia, pulmonary edema, renal failure, shock, hypoglycemia, and cerebral malaria (coma). The patient's travel history (Southeast Asia) and severe multi-organ complications point strongly to P. falciparum. P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes adhere to endothelium, causing microvascular obstruction in vital organs. Babesia microti (A) causes milder disease, primarily in the US. P. malariae (C) causes less severe malaria with a 72-hour cycle. P. ovale (D) is rare, mostly in West Africa. P. vivax (E) is common but usually causes less severe complications than falciparum."

    "question": "A 66-year-old man who is an employee at a nursing home comes to the physician because of a cough productive of thick, red sputum and chest pain for the past 3 days. He also has a 1-week history of pharyngitis that has slowly resolved. His temperature is 39.0°C (103.0°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Auscultation reveals a pleural friction rub. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Klebsiella pneumoniae",
      "B. Legionella pneumophila",
      "C. Mycoplasma pneumoniae",
      "D. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "E. Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The sound evident on lung auscultation is a pleural friction rub, which indicates inflammation of the pleural surfaces rubbing against each other. This patient presents with pneumonia symptoms (fever, productive cough, chest pain, tachypnea) and the production of thick, bloody sputum often described as \"currant jelly\" sputum. This specific sputum characteristic, along with risk factors like age and nursing home employment (exposure), points strongly towards Klebsiella pneumoniae as the causative agent. Klebsiella often causes severe, necrotizing lobar pneumonia, frequently complicated by abscess formation, cavitation, and empyema (which can cause a friction rub).\nLegionella (B) causes atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasma (C) causes milder atypical pneumonia. S. aureus (D) can cause necrotizing pneumonia but sputum is usually salmon-colored. S. pneumoniae (E) causes typical pneumonia with rust-colored sputum."

Which of the following is most likely fo be seen in this medium after 2-3 hours?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arthroconidia",

      "D. Macroconidia",
      "E. Pseudohyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This is a case of vaginal candidiasis (yeast infection), often precipitated by antibiotic use. Candida albicans is the most common cause. The germ tube test involves incubating Candida yeast cells in serum at 37°C for 2-3 hours. C. albicans is 'germ tube positive', meaning it rapidly forms short hyphal outgrowths (germ tubes) under these conditions. These germ tubes are the beginnings of pseudohyphae or true hyphae. Therefore, observing germ tubes/pseudohyphae confirms C. albicans.\nArthroconidia (A) are characteristic of dermatophytes. Encapsulated yeasts (B) suggest Cryptococcus. Rosettes of microconidia (C) suggest Sporothrix. Macroconidia (D) are seen in the mold phase of some fungi like Histoplasma."

Physical examination shows a fibrinous coating on the oral and nasal mucosa. The father says that the boy is not up-to-date on immunizations. Toxins produced by the causal organism will most likely have which of the following effects?",
    "options": [
      "A. Block translation elongation",

      "C. Interfere with neurotransmitter release",
      "D. Interfere with ribosomal subunit",
      "E. Stimulate cAMP production"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The appearance of a classic pseudomembrane on the oral and nasal mucosa in an unvaccinated child is a near-diagnostic presentation of infection by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The diphtheria toxin acts by ADP-ribosylating and inactivating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2). Inactivation of eEF-2 leads to inhibition of protein synthesis by blocking the translocation step of translation elongation, causing cell death and contributing to the pseudomembrane and systemic effects (e.g., myocarditis, neuropathy).\nBacterial toxins such as alpha toxin (S. aureus, C. perfringens) can disrupt membrane integrity (B). Tetanus and botulinum toxins interfere with neurotransmitter release (C). Shiga toxin and verotoxin interfere with the 60S ribosomal subunit (D). Cholera toxin, ETEC LT, pertussis toxin, and anthrax edema factor stimulate cAMP production (E)."

      "D. Picornavirus",
      "E. Reovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Composite viruses are created in the lab by combining anatomical pieces from different origins. This question asks which viruses' naked genomic material is *not* infectious on its own. Reovirus is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus. Host cells lack the machinery to directly transcribe mRNA from a dsRNA template. Reoviruses carry their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase within the virion core, which is necessary to synthesize +ssRNA (mRNA) from the -ssRNA strand of the genome after entry. Without this packaged polymerase, the naked dsRNA genome cannot initiate replication. Adenovirus (A) is dsDNA, transcribed by host polymerase. Calicivirus (B), Flavivirus (C), and Picornavirus (D) are all +ssRNA viruses whose genomes can directly serve as mRNA for translation by host ribosomes, making their naked RNA infectious."

Physical examination shows many lesions, up to 4-cm in diameter, with yellow crusting on the surface. There are also other sites with small blisters and with areas oozing small amounts of clear fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aphthous ulcers",

      "D. Impetigo",
      "E. Measles"

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is impetigo, which is typically seen in preschool children with poor hygiene, particularly in the summer in warm climates. The characteristic lesion is frequently large and has a golden, honey-colored crust formed from dried exudate. Younger lesions may appear as small vesicles or pustules that rupture, leaving weeping erosions (non-bullous impetigo), or as larger flaccid blisters (bullous impetigo). Most cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pyogenes is occasionally implicated. Impetigo is highly infectious.\nAphthous ulcers (A) are oral ulcers. Erysipelas (B) is a deeper dermal infection with well-demarcated erythema. Herpes simplex 1 (C) causes grouped vesicles, often periorally. Measles (E) causes a maculopapular rash, not crusted lesions."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The triad of cutaneous hemorrhages ('blueberry-muffin baby' due to thrombocytopenia and extramedullary hematopoiesis), sensorineural deafness, and periventricular CNS calcifications suggests congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, the most common congenital viral infection. Transmission risk and severity of fetal effects are highest when the mother acquires a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, especially in the first or second trimester. Primary CMV infection in immunocompetent adults is often asymptomatic or presents as a mononucleosis-like illness with fever, malaise, myalgia, and generalized lymphadenopathy (unlike EBV mono, heterophile antibodies are negative).\nA 3-day rash (A) suggests Rubella. Painless genital ulcers (C) suggest Syphilis. Transient arthralgia (D) suggests Parvovirus B19. Vesicular genital lesions (E) suggest HSV."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Spontaneous abortion or preterm labor following a maternal flu-like illness during pregnancy, especially with evidence of chorioamnionitis, is a characteristic outcome of listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a foodborne pathogen, often transmitted through contaminated delicatessen meats, unpasteurized dairy products (including soft cheeses like Brie, feta, queso fresco), and contaminated produce. Pregnant women have increased susceptibility to invasive listeriosis. Eating soft cheese is a well-known risk factor.\nHandling cats (B) is a risk for Toxoplasma. Rat bite (C) risks Streptobacillus.

Physical examination shows intercostal retractions, and wheezing and rhonchi are heard on auscultation of the chest. A chest x-ray shows patchy infiltrates and atelectasis. Gram stain and culture of the sputum shows non-fermenting, gram-negative rods. Which of the following is the most important pathogenic attribute of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Catalase",
      "B. Oxidase",
      "C. Pigment formation",
      "D. Polysaccharide capsule",
      "E. Toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A Gram stain that reveals gram-negative non-fermenting rods in a patient with a history suggestive of cystic fibrosis (recurrent respiratory infections, chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive) is most likely Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most important pathogenic feature of this organism, particularly in the context of chronic lung infection in CF patients, is the production of a mucoid exopolysaccharide capsule (alginate). This capsule forms a biofilm that protects the bacteria from host defenses (phagocytosis, antibodies, complement) and antibiotics, contributing significantly to the persistence of infection and progressive lung damage.\nPseudomonas is catalase-positive (A) but this is not its major means of pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis patients.\nPseudomonas is oxidase-positive (B) but this simply indicates that it uses cytochrome C oxidase as its terminal electron acceptor, and distinguishes it from the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.\nPigments (choice C) that are blue-green are produced by Pseudomonas, and this colors the pus that is produced in pseudomonal infections. Pyocyanin impairs the normal function of cilia, injures the respiratory epithelium, and increases inflammation. A derivative of pyocyanin, pyochelin, is a siderophore that is produced under low-iron conditions to sequester iron from the environment and enhance the growth of the pathogen.\nPseudomonal toxin (choice E), or exotoxin A, is an inhibitor of protein synthesis. It works by ribosylating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) but is not considered the most important pathogenic feature in a cystic fibrosis patient compared to the biofilm/capsule."

      "A. It is an intracellular pathogen",
      "B. It is resistant to ceftriaxone",
      "C. It is resistant to complement-mediated lysis",
      "D. Its capsule is not immunogenic",
      "E. Its pili undergo antigenic and phase variation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), featuring the triad of dermatitis (petechial/pustular rash), tenosynovitis, and migratory polyarthritis. The causative agent is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Recurrent gonococcal infections are common because N. gonorrhoeae undergoes extensive antigenic variation of its surface structures, particularly the pili (required for attachment) and Opa proteins (outer membrane proteins involved in adhesion and invasion). This variation allows the bacterium to evade the host's adaptive immune response, as antibodies generated against one variant may not recognize subsequent variants. Phase variation (switching expression of genes on/off) also contributes to immune evasion.\nN. gonorrhoeae is an extracellular pathogen (A), generally susceptible to ceftriaxone (B), and highly susceptible to complement-mediated lysis (C). It has pili, not typically a major capsule (D)."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This case illustrates a classic presentation of ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum leading to shock. The most common predisposing factor for ectopic pregnancy is damage to the fallopian tubes, often resulting from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The most common bacterial causes of PID are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Chlamydia infections, in particular, are often asymptomatic or cause mild symptoms, leading to chronic inflammation and tubal scarring without the patient being aware of the initial infection. This scarring can impede the transport of the fertilized egg to the uterus, resulting in tubal implantation.\nEscherichia (choice B) is a common cause of UTIs.\nHerpes (choice C), human papillomavirus (choice D), and Treponema (choice E) are sexually transmitted pathogens but are not the primary causes of PID leading to tubal scarring."

      "D. Decreased ribosomal binding of antibiotic",
      "E. Formation of novel cell-wall peptide bridges"

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The organism is identified as Enterococcus spp. based on its growth characteristics (growth in 6.5% NaCl and bile, esculin hydrolysis) and Gram stain (gram-positive cocci). The isolate is vancomycin-resistant (VRE), a significant nosocomial pathogen. Vancomycin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan precursors. High-level resistance in VRE (VanA/VanB types) is due to acquisition of genes that modify the peptidoglycan precursor target. Enzymes encoded by these genes synthesize precursors ending in D-alanyl-D-lactate or D-alanyl-D-serine instead of D-ala-D-ala. Vancomycin cannot effectively bind to these altered termini, thus allowing cell wall synthesis to proceed. This mechanism involves the formation of novel peptide structures in the cell wall precursors.\nAcetylation (A) inactivates aminoglycosides. Altered PBPs (B) cause beta-lactam resistance. Beta-lactamase (C) inactivates beta-lactams. Decreased ribosomal binding (D) causes resistance to protein synthesis inhibitors."

    "explanation": "This patient has Lyme disease, as evidenced by the skin lesion: erythema (chronicum) migrans, a migrating red rash that resembles a bull's-eye, and influenza-like symptoms after visiting an endemic area (Massachusetts). This disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted by the Ixodes tick. This same tick vector can also transmit Babesia microti (causing babesiosis) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causing anaplasmosis). Therefore, coinfection with Babesia microti is possible and occurs in the same geographic regions and via the same vector as Lyme disease.\nChlamydia psittaci (B) is acquired from birds.

The \"window period\" of acute HBV infection is the time interval after HBsAg becomes undetectable in the serum but before HBsAb appears. During this period, anti-HBc IgM is typically the only detectable marker of recent infection. Therefore, the defining serological change marking entry into the window period is the disappearance of HBsAg (becoming HBsAg-negative).\nHBcAg (A) is not usually detectable in serum. Anti-HBc IgG (B) replaces IgM later and persists. HBeAg (C) loss often occurs around this time but is not the defining feature of the window.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Transduction is the delivery of bacterial genes from one bacterium to another via a virus vector (phage). The phage picks up the bacterial DNA through an error in phage production. There are two types of transduction: generalized (error of lytic virus life cycle) and specialized (error of temperate virus life cycle). Since the question describes the clones of bacteria acquiring 5 *different* new traits, generalized transduction has occurred. It is in essence a \"packaging error\" in which random portions of bacterial DNA are accidentally included in progeny phage heads. When these transducing phages infect new cells, they transfer these random bacterial genes. Because any gene has a chance of being packaged, multiple different traits can be transferred to different recipients.\nConjugation (A) requires cell-to-cell contact. Specialized transduction (C) transfers only specific genes adjacent to the phage integration site. Transformation (D) involves uptake of naked DNA. Transposition (E) is movement of DNA within a cell."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "In order to assess the efficacy of treatment and guide the direction of future treatment, viral load should be measured. To assess viral load during HIV infection, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or similar nucleic acid amplification tests must be performed. Since HIV is an RNA virus, these tests quantify the amount of viral RNA in the patient's plasma. This directly reflects the level of active viral replication. A high or increasing viral load indicates ongoing replication, often due to drug resistance or non-adherence, and correlates with CD4 cell decline.\nAntibodies to envelope antigens (A) or capsid (B) are diagnostic markers but don't quantify active replication. Proviral DNA (C) measures the integrated virus in cells (reservoir size), not plasma viremia. Surface antigens (D) like p24 can be detected but RNA quantification is the standard for viral load."

    "explanation": "This patient has tuberculosis (TB), indicated by symptoms, cavitary lung lesion, and positive auramine-rhodamine stain (a fluorescent stain for acid-fast bacilli like Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Mycobacteria do not stain well with Gram stain (appearing weakly positive or not at all) due to their unique, lipid-rich cell wall. The major component responsible for this property, as well as their acid-fastness, is the presence of abundant long-chain, branched fatty acids called mycolic acids, which form a thick, waxy, hydrophobic layer outside the peptidoglycan.\nLipopolysaccharide (A) is found in gram-negative bacteria. Peptidoglycan (C) is the gram-stainable layer, but it's masked by mycolic acids in TB. Sulfatides (D) are other virulence-associated lipids in the cell wall.

They characteristically form macroscopic 'sulfur granules' (yellowish granules composed of tangled bacterial filaments) within infected tissues or exudates, such as in chronically infected tonsillar crypts or actinomycotic abscesses. Gram stain of these granules shows the typical appearance described. Actinomyces israelii is the most common species causing human actinomycosis.\nAspergillus fumigatus (B) is a mold. Blastomyces dermatitidis (C) is a dimorphic fungus (yeast in tissue). Candida albicans (D) is a yeast. Corynebacterium diphtheriae (E) are non-filamentous rods."

    "question": "An unvaccinated sanitation worker has a needlestick accident involving an empty syringe that had been previously used on a patient with a known hepatitis B infection. Which of the following is the most likely outcome for this person?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute hepatitis followed by recovery",
      "B. Asymptomatic carrier",
      "C. Persistent infection followed by recovery",
      "D. Persistent infection progressing to chronic hepatitis",
      "E. Subclinical disease followed by recovery"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Hepatitis B infection can produce a wide variety of clinical outcomes in adults. Following acute infection, the majority (estimated >90-95% in immunocompetent adults) will completely clear the virus and recover. Many of these recoveries follow a subclinical or anicteric infection, meaning the person experiences few or no symptoms despite being infected and mounting an immune response. A smaller percentage (~5-10% or less in adults) develop chronic infection, which can range from an asymptomatic carrier state (B) to chronic active hepatitis (D) potentially leading to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Symptomatic acute hepatitis (A) occurs in a minority of infected adults (~20-30%), most of whom still recover fully. Therefore, subclinical disease followed by complete recovery is the single most frequent outcome for an unvaccinated adult acquiring HBV infection."

    "question": "The World Health Organization records an alarming increase in hospital admissions worldwide that are attributable to a new and unexpected serotype of influenza A virus. The biological attribute of influenza A virus that allows the sudden appearance of dramatically new genetic variants is also present in a limited number of other viral families. Which of the following viruses also possesses this biological attribute?",
    "options": [
      "A. Coronavirus",
      "B. HIV",
      "C. Measles virus",
      "D. Rabies virus",
      "E. Rotavirus",
      "F. Rubella virus",
      "G. St. Louis encephalitis virus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This case describes an influenza pandemic, likely caused by antigenic shift. Antigenic shift is a major change in the influenza A virus surface antigens (hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase) resulting from genetic reassortment between different influenza A strains (e.g., human, avian, swine). Reassortment is possible because influenza A virus has a segmented RNA genome (8 segments). This allows for the shuffling of gene segments when two different viruses co-infect the same cell, potentially creating a novel virus to which the population has little immunity. Other viruses with segmented genomes can also undergo reassortment. Among the choices, Rotavirus (family Reoviridae) has a segmented dsRNA genome (10-12 segments) and undergoes reassortment. Bunyaviruses and Arenaviruses also have segmented RNA genomes. The other viruses listed (Coronavirus, HIV, Measles, Rabies, Rubella, St. Louis encephalitis) have non-segmented genomes."

Physical examination shows hyperemia of the pharynx, tonsillar exudates, cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Treatment with ampicillin is begun. The patient returns to the physician 8 days later because of a generalized maculopapular rash. The most likely causal agent of this woman's initial condition is linked to development of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gastric adenocarcinoma",
      "B. Hepatocellular carcinoma",
      "C. Laryngeal papillomas",
      "D. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
      "E. T-cell leukemia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The clinical features (sore throat, fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly) and the development of a maculopapular rash after ampicillin administration are highly characteristic. EBV is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with several human malignancies. The strongest associations are with endemic (African) Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (particularly common in Southern China and Southeast Asia), primary CNS lymphoma in AIDS patients, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders.\nGastric adenocarcinoma (A) is linked to H. pylori. Hepatocellular carcinoma (B) is linked to HBV and HCV. Laryngeal papillomas (C) are linked to HPV 6 and 11. T-cell leukemia (E) is linked to HTLV-1."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of atypical pneumonia (malaise, low-grade fever, chronic cough) in a young adult. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most common cause of atypical pneumonia in this age group. Mycoplasma is known for being difficult and slow to grow in culture. A characteristic, though not entirely specific, laboratory finding associated with M. pneumoniae infection is the presence of cold agglutinins (IgM antibodies that agglutinate human red blood cells at 4°C).\nKlebsiella (A) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (E) cause typical bacterial pneumonia and grow readily on standard media. Parainfluenza virus (C) causes croup. Respiratory syncytial virus (D) primarily causes bronchiolitis in infants."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The probable organism is Giardia lamblia (also known as G. duodenalis or G. intestinalis), which characteristically infects the small intestine (duodenum and jejunum). While the trophozoite form typically has a pear shape with a 'face-like' appearance in stool samples or aspirates, when attached to the intestinal brush border in biopsy specimens, they often appear flattened or crescent-shaped in cross-section. Giardiasis commonly causes prolonged diarrhea, malabsorption, bloating, and flatulence. Entamoeba histolytica (A) infects the colon. E. coli (B) is bacteria. Naegleria fowleri (D) causes meningoencephalitis. Trichomonas vaginalis (E) causes vaginitis."

      "D. Growth on MacConkey",
      "E. Growth on sorbitol MacConkey"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Campylobacter jejuni is a pathogen that causes an invasive enteric infection associated with ingestion of raw or undercooked food products, or through direct contact with infected animals. In the United States, ingestion of contaminated poultry that has not been sufficiently cooked is the most common means of acquiring the infection. Patients typically have bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The presence of fecal leukocytes indicates an invasive infection. The organism is a gram-negative rod with a curved \"comma shape.\" A key differential characteristic used in the lab is its ability to grow preferentially at 42°C (a thermophilic property), which inhibits most other enteric flora. Culturing on selective media at 42°C under microaerophilic conditions is standard for isolating Campylobacter.\nGrowth at 4°C (A) selects for Yersinia/Listeria. EMB (C) and MacConkey (D) differentiate Enterobacteriaceae. Sorbitol MacConkey (E) differentiates E. coli O157:H7."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is typical for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D-K) is the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infections leading to PID. Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium. Diagnosis often relies on NAATs, but microscopic examination can sometimes reveal characteristic findings. Chlamydia replicates within host epithelial cells, forming intracellular inclusions containing elementary bodies (infectious form) and reticulate bodies (replicating form). These inclusions are rich in glycogen and can be stained with iodine or Giemsa stain. Finding such inclusions within epithelial cells supports a diagnosis of Chlamydia.\nNaked DNA virus (A) = HPV. Gram-negative diplococci (B) = Neisseria gonorrhoeae (less likely with scant neutrophils). Intranuclear inclusions (C) = CMV/HSV. Lactose-fermenting bacilli (E) = E. coli.

      "E. Vibrio vulnificus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Vibrio vulnificus is an extremely invasive organism, producing a septicemia in patients after they eat raw shellfish (especially oysters); or causing wound infections, cellulitis, fasciitis, and myositis after exposure to seawater or after cleaning shellfish. Patients at high risk for septicemia include those with liver disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hemochromatosis, and immunosuppression. Symptoms after ingestion include fever, chills, hypotension, gastroenteritis, and characteristic fluid-filled blisters (hemorrhagic bullae) that progress to muscle necrosis, especially affecting the lower limbs. The disease progresses rapidly and has a high mortality rate.\nCampylobacter jejuni (A) causes inflammatory diarrhea. ETEC (B) causes traveler's diarrhea. Salmonella (C) causes gastroenteritis.

[Diagram shows gene order relative to IS: clindamycin --- IS --- sulfonamide --- gentamicin]",
    "options": [
      "A. Ciprofloxacin",

      "D. Sulfonamide",
      "E. Vancomycin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Specialized transduction is a mechanism of transfer of DNA that involves an accident in the life cycle of a temperate (lysogenic) phage. In cases in which lysogeny is terminated by the destruction of the viral repressor gene, errors of excising the phage DNA out of the chromosome can cause transfer of bacterial DNA to another cell. The genes that are most likely to be transferred in this way are those that are closest to the insertion site ('IS' or att site) of the phage. In this diagram, the drug-resistance gene closest to 'IS' is the sulfonamide-resistance gene. The gentamicin resistance gene is also near 'IS' but appears farther away than sulfonamide based on the diagram.\nCiprofloxacin (A) and Clindamycin (B) are shown farther away from IS. Vancomycin (E) is also shown distant from IS."

A heterophile antibody test is negative and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is positive for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Seven months later, the woman delivers a full-term baby with no obvious signs of infection. Measurement of which the following isotypes of immunoglobulin is most appropriate to defect acute infection in the neonate?",
    "options": ["A. IgA", "B. IgE", "C. IgG1", "D. IgG4", "E. IgM"],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "IgM immunoglobulin directed against Toxoplasma would provide evidence of infection in the newborn baby. Since IgG antibodies are actively transported across the placenta into the fetus, it is not possible to determine the origin of IgG antibodies in a neonate. The presence of an elevated IgG titer (including subclasses IgG1 and IgG4) in a neonate is simply a reflection of the response of the mother to the agent and passive transfer. IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta. Therefore, the presence of Toxoplasma-specific IgM in the neonate's serum indicates active production by the infant in response to infection, confirming congenital toxoplasmosis.\nIgA (choice A) is the antibody that is produced in response to mucosal infections. It cannot cross the placenta effectively. IgE (choice B) is the antibody produced in response to parasites or allergens; it does not cross the placenta."

      "D. Treatment of the neonate's eyes with erythromycin",
      "E. Vaccination of the mother"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This neonate has bacterial meningitis presenting in the early neonatal period. The CSF findings and Gram stain (gram-positive cocci) strongly suggest Group B Streptococcus (GBS), the most common cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis and meningitis. GBS is acquired intrapartum from a colonized mother. The standard prevention strategy is universal screening of pregnant women for GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks gestation and administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), usually IV penicillin or ampicillin, during labor to all colonized women or those with risk factors. This dramatically reduces the risk of early-onset GBS disease in the newborn.\nAvoidance of deli foods (A) prevents Listeria. Enema (B) is not standard practice for preventing neonatal sepsis. Eye prophylaxis (D) prevents gonococcal/chlamydial conjunctivitis. Maternal vaccination (E) is important for other diseases but not currently standard for GBS prevention."

Most cases occur in four states (Texas, California, Virginia, and Florida) and are associated with cattle, in which it produces spontaneous abortions. Most cases of brucellosis produce mild disease or fevers of unknown origin with an undulating pattern, malaise, night sweats, weight loss, and weakness. However, Brucella species can infect the cardiovascular system and cause endocarditis. The aortic valve is most commonly involved, followed by the mitral valve and then both. Most cases of brucellosis are associated with occupational exposure in persons such as veterinarians, ranchers, and those who handle animal carcasses.\nBacillus anthracis (A) causes anthrax. Coccidioides immitis (C) causes valley fever. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (D) causes erysipeloid skin infections. Trichinella spiralis (E) causes trichinosis from undercooked meat."

    "explanation": "Vitamin B12 deficiency with resulting megaloblastic anemia (macrocytic erythrocytes) is specifically associated with infection with the fish tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum, which is found in Scandinavia and the U.S. Great Lakes region (Michigan). The adult worm attaches to the small intestinal mucosa and absorbs large amounts of dietary vitamin B12, competing with the host and leading to deficiency. Chronic diarrhea and fatigue are also common symptoms.\nClonorchis sinensis (A) is a liver fluke causing biliary disease. Echinococcus granulosus (C) causes hydatid cysts. Taenia saginata (D, beef tapeworm) and Taenia solium (E, pork tapeworm) typically cause milder GI symptoms and do not cause B12 deficiency."

    "explanation": "The question essentially asks which viruses possess the capacity to reverse transcribe, changing an RNA message into DNA form (cDNA). Retroviruses (like HIV) are famous for their reverse transcriptase. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a Hepadnavirus, also utilizes reverse transcriptase. Although HBV has a DNA genome, it replicates via an RNA intermediate, using an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) to synthesize DNA from the RNA pregenome. Therefore, reverse transcriptase from HBV (or retroviruses) is used in molecular biology to generate cDNA from mRNA templates.\nAdenovirus (A) is a DNA virus without RT.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Cysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larval cysts of the tapeworm Taenia solium. Patients acquire the infection by ingesting the eggs, which reach a larval stage in various tissues. Humans usually serve as the definitive hosts of the tapeworm (intestinal infection acquired from undercooked pork), and swine serve as the intermediate hosts. However, humans can also become intermediate hosts by ingesting eggs passed in human feces (fecal-oral route), leading to cysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis occurs when larvae encyst in the CNS, often presenting with seizures (most common presentation), headaches, or hydrocephalus. CT/MRI shows characteristic cysts (often with a scolex), edema, and/or calcified granulomas. Infection is endemic in many developing countries, including Honduras. The lifecycle involves swine as intermediate hosts, so contact with swine or environments contaminated with human feces containing T. solium eggs is the ultimate source.\nExposure to herding dogs (B) risks Echinococcus. Mosquito vector (C) transmits malaria/encephalitis. Cow manure (D) is not typical for T. solium. New pets (E) risk Toxoplasma."
