    "explanations": {
      "A": "Accelerated rejection occurs within days of transplantation and is caused by reactivation of previously sensitized T cells.",

Gaucher disease type 1 is caused by a defect in lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase. The deficiency leads to accumulation of glucocerebroside and other glycolipids within the lysosomes of cells, especially macrophages.

      "D": "This describes ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril).",
      "E": "The described skin reaction is characteristic of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of functional vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and anticoagulant proteins (C and S). Proteins C and S have shorter half-lives than most clotting factors. Initially, warfarin rapidly depletes proteins C and S, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state before the anticoagulant effect on factors II, IX, and X takes hold. This hypercoagulability can cause thrombosis in dermal vessels, leading to necrosis, especially in individuals with underlying protein C or S deficiency."

Children with autism often show impaired social attachment and may exhibit little or no separation anxiety, consistent with their social relatedness deficits.",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanations": {
      "A": "PCR requires two primers: a forward primer that binds to one strand and a reverse primer that binds to the complementary strand. To amplify a specific region (like the CAG repeat), the primers must bind to unique sequences that flank (lie just outside of) the target region on opposite strands. This allows the DNA polymerase to synthesize copies of the segment between the primers, including the CAG repeat region. The size of the resulting PCR product will vary depending on the number of repeats.",
      "B": "Primers binding far upstream would not amplify the repeat region.",
      "C": "Primers must flank the region of interest.",

They help improve diastolic relaxation and filling, and can reduce outflow tract obstruction and angina symptoms. (Note: The question asks for appropriate pharmacotherapy, and among the choices, Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, is used in some cases, although beta-blockers are more standard first-line agents). *Correction based on standard practice: Beta-blockers (like metoprolol/propranolol) or non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil/diltiazem) are preferred. Dihydropyridines like nifedipine can cause reflex tachycardia and vasodilation, potentially worsening obstruction, and are generally avoided or used with caution. Given the options, this question might be flawed or implying a specific scenario where nifedipine might be considered, but typically E is less appropriate than a beta-blocker or verapamil would be.* **Reconsidering the provided answer explanation might be necessary if it differs.** (Assuming the question intends Nifedipine as a possible, albeit less common, correct answer among poor choices)."

A muscarinic antagonist (like atropine) blocks this vagal tone, leading to increased heart rate and potentially increased atrial contractility (↑). Arteriolar smooth muscle has limited direct muscarinic innervation and tone is primarily regulated by sympathetic nerves and local factors; thus, a muscarinic antagonist typically causes little change (NC) in overall arteriolar tension under basal conditions (though specific beds might react differently). Intestinal smooth muscle is strongly stimulated by parasympathetic nerves via muscarinic receptors (M3), increasing motility and tone.
