      "A": "Pyruvate carboxylase is not part of glycolysis.",
      "B": "Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes the first committed step of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, lactate, or alanine precursors, converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria. This oxaloacetate is then converted to PEP (via PEPCK). Deficiency severely impairs gluconeogenesis.",

      "B": "Ketonuria is not a typical feature of urea cycle defects.",
      "C": "In OTC deficiency, the substrate carbamoyl phosphate accumulates in the mitochondria and leaks into the cytosol, where it enters the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, leading to overproduction of orotic acid and subsequent orotic aciduria. This does not occur in CPS I deficiency because carbamoyl phosphate is not produced.",

      "A": "Seizures occur in both conditions.",
      "B": "Blindness occurs in both conditions.",
      "C": "Niemann-Pick disease is caused by sphingomyelinase deficiency, leading to sphingomyelin accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system (macrophages), resulting in significant hepatosplenomegaly.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanations": {
      "A": "Hemoglobin synthesis requires iron and protoporphyrin.",
      "B": "Scurvy is caused by Vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C is required as a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, enzymes essential for the post-translational modification (hydroxylation) of proline and lysine residues in procollagen. This hydroxylation is necessary for stable cross-linking and triple helix formation. Defective collagen synthesis leads to fragile capillaries (bleeding) and impaired connective tissue integrity (poor wound healing, gum/bone issues).",

      "A": "HDL levels may be low but are present.",
      "B": "Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by defective MTP, which is required for the assembly and secretion of ApoB-containing lipoproteins. This results in the inability to form chylomicrons (containing ApoB-48) in the intestine and VLDL (containing ApoB-100) in the liver. Consequently, chylomicrons, VLDL, and their downstream products (IDL, LDL) are absent or extremely low in plasma.",

      "A": "Free fatty acids do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and cannot be effectively utilized by the brain.",
      "B": "During prolonged starvation (after several days to a week), the liver produces significant amounts of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate) from fatty acid oxidation. These ketone bodies can cross the blood-brain barrier and are utilized by the brain as its primary fuel source, reducing its reliance on glucose.",
      "C": "Lactate can be used by the brain to some extent but is not the predominant fuel in prolonged starvation.",
