    "page": 1,
    "topic": "Acute coronary syndrome",
    "explanation": "A stat dose of 300 mg aspirin is the correct figure. Low-dose (75 mg) aspirin is used for long-term prevention. ACS is the title given to a collection of cardiac diseases that all share the same atherosclerotic aetiology. ST-elevated MI, non-ST-elevated MI and unstable angina are all caused by stenosed coronary arteries starving the myocardium of oxygen (angina), leading to hypoxic cell death (myocardial infarction). Unstable angina occurs on the cusp of these phenomena, when a rest is no longer adequate to replenish the myocardium with oxygen. Acute coronary stenoses are usually caused by intimal plaque rupture leading to an intraluminal thrombus. Aspirin, clopidogrel and heparin aim to prevent platelets binding and therefore to arrest thrombus growth and dissolve the thrombus. Aspirin can cause stomach ulcers and so, in order to balance risks and benefits, low-dose aspirin is given long term; a higher dose (300 mg) is given acutely. Statins prophylactically lower serum cholesterol, and so it is thought to reduce plaque formation in the first place. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers reduce afterload and heart rate, so the heart does not have to work as hard – this lowers its oxygen demand, hopefully enough to prevent hypoxic damage.",

    "explanation": "Benign prostatic hypertrophy can cause urinary retention and increased pressure in the urinary outflow tract, and as this disease affects older men, who can be quite reluctant to seek help with non-urgent medical problems, this can get to the stage at which kidney function is impaired. Recurrent kidney stones passing into the ureter can cause scarring, especially at narrow sites such as the vesicoureteric junction. Retroperitoneal fibrosis typically involves a fibrosing inflammatory reaction starting in the wall of the aorta and spreading retroperitoneally. The ureters can become embroiled in the fibrous tissue. Obstruction is believed to be due to a loss of peristalsis rather than occlusion. Schistosomiasis is common in the Middle East and parts of Africa, featuring granulomas forming around the eggs of schistosomes in the urinary tract, and these can obstruct the urinary tract. Systemic sclerosis leads to a fibrinoid thickening of the afferent arterioles, leading to reduced renal perfusion and thus renal impairment, but it does not cause an obstructive uropathy.",

This lesion appears to be an actinic keratosis – it is not pigmented (effectively ruling out melanoma), and it is flat rather than raised, making basal cell and squamous cell carcinomata unlikely (although there can be superficial basal cell carcinomas, which are well demarcated and deep red, with less scale). A small mildly erythematous patch with keratotic hypertrophy (scales and horns) is most likely an actinic keratosis (or solar keratosis). Treatment of isolated small lesions is by cryotherapy. It has no concerning features to suggest that excision or histopathological examination is required. Large areas of skin with multiple actinic keratoses can be treated with 5-fluorouracil cream to avoid excessive scarring from cryotherapy, and can be more effective at slowing re-growth.",

    "answer": "D",
    "page": 2,
    "topic": "Headaches",
    "explanation": "Polycythaemia rubra vera is a myeloproliferative disorder characterised by a raised haemoglobin level, red cell count and packed cell volume (haematocrit). The condition is caused by the mutation of a single pluripotent stem cell, which results in the excessive production of erythrocytes and, to a lesser degree, platelets and neutrophils. As a result, the blood becomes extremely viscous causing an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis and paradoxical bleeding. Patients often complain of headaches, visual disturbance, lethargy and pruritis that is classically worse after bathing in warm water. Treatment of the polycythaemia rubra vera involves venesection (blood-letting) and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea. If treated appropriately patients tend to survive for many years and often die from non-related causes. Approximately 30% of patients will develop myelofibrosis and 5% will develop acute myeloid leukaemia as part of the disease’s natural history. Secondary polycythaemia is usually caused by the increased secretion of erythropoietin as part of the physiological response to hypoxia in conditions such as chronic obstructive airways disease and cyanotic heart disease. Less frequently erythropoetin is secreted ectopically from tumour cells (e.g. renal cell carcinomas). Occasionally the condition is iatrogenic, caused by the overuse of artificial erythropoietin used in the treatment of conditions such as anaemia of chronic renal failure. Investigating polycythaemia involves referral to a haematologist, who will accurately assess the red cell mass and exclude secondary causes. Bone marrow analysis may be required to diagnose genetic abnormalities. The treatment of secondary polycythaemia involves managing the underlying disease and symptomatic venesection.",

Pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccination is provided to reduce the risk of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by viral infection.

High-flow oxygen is needed to maintain a saturation level of 94–98%. In acute life-threatening asthma, the nebulised route (oxygen driven) is recommended. Steroids reduce mortality, relapses, subsequent hospital admission and requirement for beta-2 agonist therapy.

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 3,
    "topic": "Eczema versus psoriasis",
    "explanation": "Whilst nail pitting and ridging may occasionally be seen with eczema, nail changes are much more commonly associated with psoriasis, usually with nail pitting and onycholysis (detachment of parts of the nail from the nail bed), and occasionally with subungual hyperkeratosis (extensive keratotic growth beneath the nail). Distal interphalangeal joint disease (in this case with pain and swelling) is one of five characteristic patterns of ‘psoriatic arthropathy’, which overall around 5–10% of those with psoriasis will develop at some stage – in some cases, before the outbreak of psoriasis. The five patterns are distal interphalangeal arthritis, symmetrical polyarthritis, asymmetrical oligoarthritis, spondyloarthropathy and arthritis mutilans, which is a severe destructive arthropathy mainly affecting the hands. Eczema is more commonly localised to flexures, whereas psoriatic plaques are more typically localised to extensor surfaces. That said, there is a variety of psoriasis that more often develops later in life, in which the plaques appear in well-opposed flexural surfaces such as the groin and submammary area. Psoriasis more often presents with well-demarcated lesions or “plaques”, whereas eczematous lesions more often are described as “patches”. Psoriasis typically responds well to sunlight and thus would be worse in the winter months. This is the basis of ultraviolet (UV) therapy for psoriasis, and patients may be advised to expose affected skin (within reason) to sunshine where possible – although this is often difficult due to cosmetic concerns.",

    "answer": "D",
    "page": 3,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis",
    "explanation": "Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis is unusual in multiple sclerosis (MS), and is more typical of neuromyelitis optica (NMO or Devic disease), a rare autoimmune central nervous system demyelinating disease affecting the spinal cord and optic nerves. Once thought to be a subtype of MS, however, it is now known to be a distinct disease strongly associated with anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies. Whilst grey matter is affected in MS, and there is some evidence that overall grey matter volume decreases in MS and correlates with disability, focal grey matter inflammatory lesions would not be expected, and the focal lesions are in fact found in the white matter. The cerebellum and brainstem are affected in multiple sclerosis, however, not exclusively. White matter lesions are classically described as “periventricular”, and the lesions found do not always correlate with a clinical focus of disease. This is because the central nervous system (CNS) inflammation does not always cause demyelination or axonal damage of clinical significance, and the CNS can recover from these foci of inflammation.",

Bundle branch block can be remembered by: WiLLiaM and MaRRoW. LBBB (the “L”s in WiLLiaM) is reported by a broad S-wave (or deep Q- and S-waves) in the right-hand leads (forming a “W” in the QRS of V1–3, mainly V1) and a pair of R-waves in the left-hand leads (forming an “M” in the QRS of V4–6, mainly V6).

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) reports the reverse: an “M” in the QRS of leads V1–3 and a “W” in the QRS of V4–6.

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 5,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of vertigo",
    "explanation": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is caused by debris blocking the normal flow of endolymph in the labyrinth, leading to misreporting of positional change by the vestibules, and a discrepancy between actual position and the position of the head according to the vestibules. Thus, nystagmus occurs as two different inputs compete for different oculomotor outputs, and vertigo (the perception that the world is moving) ensues. This happens only when the head moves and there is no vertigo with a still head. It usually affects one side only, and thus Hallpike’s manoeuvre (below) only reveals nystagmus when the patient’s head is tilted back whilst they face one side and not the other. Torsional nystagmus is normally seen after a few seconds of the head being tilted back – it is important to keep the patient lying back for some time. The nystagmus should wear off after around 20 seconds, and on repeat testing it lasts a shorter amount of time (“fatiguing”). This is the basis of vestibular exercises, which are designed so that compensatory mechanisms may be induced more swiftly and the vertigo attacks will thus become less frequent and less disabling. The Hallpike test is conducted as follows: 1. The patient sits upright with their legs extended. 2. The patient’s head is then rotated 45 degrees. 3. The patient is then made to lie down quickly and the head is held in extension. 4. The patient’s eyes are then observed. A positive test will result in nystagmus towards the affected side after a 5–10 second latent period.",

    "question": "A 43-year-old man presents to his GP with a 3-month history of recurrent nose bleeds, mucosal bleeding, haemoptysis and recurrent sinusitis. Besides that, he also noticed that he has increasingly become short of breath. On examination, he had a nasal deformity and chest auscultation revealed crackles in the left lower zone. A urine dipstick test showed microscopic haematuria. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "topic": "Epistaxis",
    "explanation": "Wegener granulomatosis is characterised by systemic vasculitis that involves small and medium vessels. The classic triad consists of upper and lower respiratory tract involvement and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. The upper respiratory tract involvement includes otorrhoea, sinusitis, nasal discharge and crusting, epistaxis, oral and nasal ulcers, mucosal bleeding and inflammation, nasal septal perforation and a saddle nose deformity. The lower respiratory tract involvement includes cough, haemoptysis, chest pain and shortness of breath. Microscopic haematuria is a common finding in Wegener granulomatosis. A positive ANCA test in the setting of this classic triad is sufficient to diagnose Wegener granulomatosis without a histological confirmation. Goodpasture syndrome is caused by an anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody that results in pulmonary haemorrhage and glomerulonephritis without involvement of the upper respiratory tract.",

    "explanation": "C. difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-association diarrhoea and hospital morbidity within the country. C. difficile is a Gram-positive commensal bacterium of the gastrointestinal tract that can proliferate when the intestinal flora is disturbed by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Third-generation cephalosporins were particularly implicated with this and their use is not advised in the over 65s. C. difficile produces two enterotoxins (A and B) that cause severe inflammation of the intestinal mucosa and the formation of thick fibrous bands (pseudomembranes) in the intestine, which can harbour large numbers of bacteria. The patient often has significant diarrhoea (with or without blood), which can lead to rapid dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and death. C. difficile is treated by managing the patient’s fluid and electrolyte balance and prescribing a course of metronidazole or vancomycin. Much effort is being placed in the prevention of Clostridium infection by promoting the correct use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and educating staff and visitors regarding the importance of hand washing. It should be noted that the spores of C. difficile are not destroyed by alcohol hand gel, meaning that soap and water must be used every time!",

    "explanation": "Falciparum antigen dipstick testing is a useful, cheap and labour-unintensive way to diagnose or exclude falciparum malaria, however, a well-examined blood film is far more sensitive. Thick and thin blood films are done because thick films make pickup of low-level parasitaemias more likely and thin blood films allow species identification and quantification (more than 2% of red blood cells being parasitised is a prognostic marker of severe disease). Blood films should be taken on 3 consecutive days, as an initial film may be negative due to the lifecycle of the parasite. Blood cultures should be taken as there may be coexisting bacteraemia (“algid malaria”), however they do not grow Plasmodium species. Liver biopsy is not used to investigate malaria.",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 6,
    "topic": "Electrocardiogram Interpretation",
    "explanation": "Analyse an ECG methodically. Start with rate: bradycardia if less than 60/min, tachycardic if greater than 100/min. Next, check the rhythm is regular; this can be trickier than it seems, especially if the patient is tachycardic. The axis is determined by looking at the amplitude of the QRS complex relative to lead II, i.e. lead II is 0°, lead I is –45° and lead III is +135°. If the QRS amplitude is greatest in lead II and leads I and III have identical, lesser magnitudes, then the QRS is not deviated. If it is most positive in lead I, then it is deviated to the left. If it is most positive in lead III, then it is deviated to the right. Remember that the QRS complex is the charge “washing” through the myocardium. The axis of the QRS helps us to visualise the comparative muscularity of the right and left ventricles, which may in turn highlight a disease process against which a given ventricle is fighting, e.g. aortic stenosis leading to left ventricular hypertrophy resulting in left axis deviation. An axis outside of ±30 degrees can be said to be deviated. The P-wave position and shape should be noted. The PR interval should be less than 0.20 seconds. In this case, there is a fixed delay (through the atrio-ventricular node) which is called first-degree heart block. QRS amplitude, shape and duration are all significant. A width >3 small squares (at 25 mm/s ECG speed) is equivalent to 0.12 seconds, and this is the boundary between QRS complexes being narrow or broad. Ventricular tachycardias are broad (and faster than 90/min). A broad complex may well contain a distortion in shape in one of the leads indicating bundle branch block. This ECG has a narrow QRS complex. Finally, the T-wave size and the QT duration should be observed. It is always good practice to compare a current ECG to a previous ECG but this should not prevent you reviewing and summarising the ECG. If there is any doubt, and no old ECGs are available, a repeat test can be requested.",

Viral pericarditis can be caused by a preceding viral respiratory tract infection; bilateral pulmonary effusions may also be present. Pleurisy – inflammation of the pleura – does not directly cause ECG changes and does not correlate as well with the sign of postural pain changes. Myocardial infarction and angina are unlikely to cause pain of this nature, but a 12-hour troponin test should be requested.

    "topic": "Gout prophylaxis",
    "explanation": "Long-term diclofenac carries the risk of side effects such as peptic ulceration and renal impairment, and will achieve nothing between attacks as there is no inflammation. Similarly, depot steroid injections may be used in acute attacks but long-term steroids carry the risk of immunosuppression as well as many other side effects. The underlying pathology in gout is hyperuricaemia, therefore prophylactic treatment should aim to reduce serum urate. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, which produces urate, and thus lowers serum urate. It can precipitate acute attacks and therefore should not be used within 2–4 weeks of an acute attack, and should be started with either NSAIDs or colchicine used at least 2 weeks before and 4 weeks after starting. Long-term colchicine is not recommended for prophylaxis. Sulfinpyrazone is a second-line prophylactic agent.",

    "explanation": "Hepatomegaly describes the enlargement of the liver. It is detected clinically by palpating the right upper quadrant during inspiration. As the patient inspires the liver is displaced inferiorly by the lungs onto the examiner’s hand. In normal individuals the liver should not be palpated with the exception of children and particularly thin patients. The presence of hepatomegaly is usually described in terms of size, e.g. number of finger-breadths below the costal margin. The texture of the liver edge should also be documented and it should be noted whether it is smooth or craggy. Conditions that cause hepatomegaly with a smooth margin include viral hepatitis, biliary tract obstruction, hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd–Chiari syndrome), right heart failure and myeloproliferative disease. Hepatomegaly with a craggy border is usually associated with hepatic metastatic disease and polycystic disease. End-stage cirrhosis does not result in hepatomegaly. Early liver damage often causes hepatomegaly and fatty infiltration, but as the damage progresses and fibrosis ensues, replacing the normal tissue architecture, the liver becomes small and scarred.",

    "page": 8,
    "topic": "Investigation of status epilepticus",
    "explanation": "There are many reasons why this man may be in status epilepticus, but the most common cause, and a quick and simple one to rule out, would be low antiepileptic drug levels. This is estimated to be the cause of around 30% of status episodes. Alcoholism is prevalent amongst the homeless population, and many antiepileptics are metabolised by the cytochrome p450 system in the liver (phenytoin included). Chronic alcohol abuse can induce increased cytochrome p450 activity, which could then lower the phenytoin levels. His compliance with phenytoin therapy could be poor given his social situation. Regarding the other investigations, brain imaging will be poor or impossible as he is still fitting, and EEG is only indicated if he is still fitting after various management steps have been undertaken and he is taken to the intensive treatment unit (ITU) for general anaesthesia. Regarding the echocardiogram, the homeless population is indeed at risk of endocarditis, which could lead to subsequent septic embolisation to the brain, causing the seizures. A murmur is also heard, however this would be a less likely cause than low phenytoin levels, and less easy to treat acutely if found. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head should be carried out beforehand if an intracranial cause such as septic emboli is being considered. Furthermore, regarding the possibly new murmur and fever, the fever could be due to the seizure activity, and the murmur could be benign or old (it may be worth contacting the GP or searching for the patient’s old hospital notes to see if it has been investigated).",

This back-pressure is the cause of his pulmonary oedema (inspiratory crackles, frothy pinky–white sputum). The loud first heart sound is due to the mitral valve leaflets shutting abruptly at the start of systole, as if a door ajar were closed with the same force as a door wide open.

    "explanation": "It is likely that there has been a fair bit of blood loss intraoperatively. The operation notes could be checked to confirm this. It is major orthopaedic surgery and she has conjunctival pallor, which make it seem fairly likely. She seems clinically dry with tachycardia, reduced blood pressure and delayed capillary refill, which follows on from the intraoperative blood loss with slow intravenous fluid replacement (12 hourly). She could also theoretically be septic, but low-grade pyrexia is common postoperatively and there is no presumed source. A urine dip test could be taken to rule out urine infection. Hypovolaemia is more parsimonious. She does not have heart failure and should be able to tolerate a fluid challenge; this is a quick way to find out whether hypovolaemia was to blame. Normal saline should be used rather than 5% dextrose, as the saline will remain largely intravascular, whereas the 5% dextrose, after rapid metabolism of the dextrose, is essentially water, and this will enter the tissues and not increase the intravascular volume as much. Intravenous fluids could then subsequently be sped up. Flushing the catheter can rule out obstruction of the catheter, but the bladder was not palpable on examination and there was no previous bleeding to suggest potential obstruction; this is quick and does not harm the patient so could also be tried. Morphine does not commonly reduce urine output or lead to renal failure. It can cause urinary retention, however a catheter is in situ so this is not the cause here.",

    "explanation": "The general theory of Parkinson’s disease management is that early on, when there are still many SNpc neurons surviving, L-DOPA is more useful as this precursor then increases the amount of dopamine being released in a physiological manner to allow movement. However, as the disease progresses and the SNpc neurons reduce in number, L-DOPA increases will not be able to increase the functional amount of dopamine being released in the basal ganglia and so dopamine agonists should increasingly be used. This is less physiological but improves bradykinesia. At the latter stage, increasing L-DOPA is unlikely to provide a benefit; decreasing L-DOPA may be advisable but not without a dopamine agonist, and stopping it altogether is likely to worsen function. The addition of a dopamine agonist may relieve bradykinesia and postural instability at this stage. A peripheral dopamine antagonist: 1) will not act centrally and 2) would exacerbate symptoms, so would be no help. Domperidone can in fact be used to relieve medication-associated nausea in Parkinson disease.",

There is chronic granulomatous inflammation of the interlobular bile ducts causing cholestasis. Presentation is through the effects of cholestasis – jaundice, pruritis, hepatomegaly and pain. It may also be picked up early by deranged liver function tests in the asymptomatic patient. Diagnosis is made by liver biopsy, and anti-mitochondrial antibodies may be present. Management is threefold: 1) symptomatic to reduce itchiness and prevent osteoporosis, 2) specific medications to improve absorption and finally 3) disease-modifying drugs such as ursodeoxycholic acid (which reduces cholestasis). Recent evidence however suggests that ursodeoxycholic acid does not improve mortality. Liver transplant may be an option in some candidates with end-stage disease.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 10,
    "topic": "Management of anaemia",
    "explanation": "These blood tests reveal iron-deficiency anaemia, which is most commonly treated with oral iron supplementation. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is defined as a haemoglobin concentration below 13.5 g/dL in males or 11.5 g/dL in females, in association with a low mean cell volume (MCV) and evidence of depleted iron stores (i.e. a low ferritin and a raised total iron binding capacity). In the developed world IDA is usually secondary to chronic blood loss from gastrointestinal, uterine and urinary tract sources. (Worldwide, hookworm infection and schistosomiasis are common causes.) In cases where the source of bleeding is obvious, further investigation is usually not necessary and treatment can begin; however in many instances bleeding goes unnoticed and is secondary to a more sinister cause such as gastrointestinal malignancy. As such, patients with IDA without an obvious cause must be referred for investigation of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract in the first instance. To treat IDA the underlying cause must be corrected and iron stores replenished. The most appropriate method of replacing iron is with oral supplementation (e.g. ferrous sulphate 200 mg tds). Haemoglobin should rise by 1 g/dL every 7 days. Treatment is given until haemoglobin concentrations return to normal and for a further 3–6 months in order to replenish the depleted iron stores. If the haemoglobin fails to respond as expected you must consider non-compliance/concordance with treatment, malabsorption and misdiagnosis. Intramuscular and intravenous preparations of iron do exist but are usually reserved for cases of refractory anaemia secondary to malabsorption and chronic disease. Blood transfusion should only be considered in severe and symptomatic anaemia (e.g. Hb <8 g/dL). Expect the haemoglobin concentration to increase by 1 g/dL per unit of red blood cells given.",

    "page": 11,
    "topic": "ACE inhibitors",
    "explanation": "Glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis are both autoimmune in origin and aside from supportive measures and renoprotection with drugs including ACE inhibitors, immunosuppression is commonly used and works with varying effect. Systemic sclerosis can affect the afferent arterioles with fibrinoid thickening and vessel narrowing, which can come on rapidly (“scleroderma renal crisis”). Immunosuppression is often unhelpful, whereas ACE inhibitors are of immense benefit and can halt progression of loss of renal function and sometimes even partially reverse it. In severe renal artery stenosis, ACE inhibitors can further reduce or abolish glomerular filtration. This is because angiotensin normally increases glomerular capillary perfusion pressure, and so when ACE inhibitors reduce this ability, with a background of already grossly reduced renal perfusion, the glomerular filtration rate will fall. For this reason, the response to ACE inhibitors should be monitored in patients with renal failure (and especially so in patients with known peripheral arterial disease), and if renal function worsens, various imaging techniques can be used to look for renal artery stenosis (such as Doppler ultrasound and renal arteriography). Overall, whilst ACE inhibitors should be avoided where possible in patients with renal artery stenosis, they are beneficial in protecting the kidneys of renal failure patients, and under specialist supervision can be started at a reduced dose in patients with renal artery stenosis, especially if there is hypertension that cannot be controlled by other means.",

    "topic": "Skin lesions",
    "explanation": "The rolled edge, pearly appearance and telangiectasia are all classic features of basal cell carcinoma. The history of sun exposure creates concerns of skin cancer. It is not described as melanocytic, therefore malignant melanoma seems highly unlikely (although amelanocytic malignant melanomas exist). Squamous cell carcinomas are ill-defined keratotic nodules that often ulcerate more so than basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). They can grow faster than the slow growing BCCs. The risk factors are largely the same, however, and the combined investigation and management of both is simple: excise and send for histology (usually curative and diagnostic). Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing benign tumours that often mimic squamous cell carcinomas. They can become quite large and typically develop a central ulceration and necrosis pattern. They should be excised to exclude squamous cell carcinoma as it is difficult to tell the two apart, although many resolve spontaneously. Actinic keratoses are small erythematous silver-scaled patches or papules that are common in sun damage, but are benign and can be treated (if sufficiently large to warrant treatment) by cryotherapy, or if diffuse can be treated by topical 5-fluorouracil cream or imiquimod cream (to save repeated cryotherapy and associated minor scarring). They have the potential to turn into squamous cell carcinomas after several years.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 12,
    "topic": "Ankylosing spondylitis",
    "explanation": "AS is an inflammatory disorder of the back that is more common in males. Patients present with lower back pain and stiffness of insidious onset that is worse in the morning and gets better with exercise. There is poor spinal flexion and in severe cases patients develop a rigid lower spine with a hunch (known as the “question mark posture” or “hang dog posture”). AS may also affect the large joints asymmetrically (although it affects the lumbar joints symmetrically). AS is associated with a number of extra-articular features that are remembered by the five As: Apical lung fibrosis, Anterior uveitis, Achilles tendonitis/plantar fasciitis, Aortic regurgitation, and Amyloidosis. This diagnosis of AS is made using Schober’s test: two fingers are placed 10 cm apart on the lower back of the patient (5 cm above and below the L5 vertebra in the midline) and the patient is asked to flex. An increase between the fingers of <5 cm indicates spinal stiffness. X-ray of the hip shows blurred margins of the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis). Characteristic radiological features of the spine in AS include erosion of the corners of the vertebral bodies (Romanus lesions), the development of bony spurs (syndesmophytes) and calcification of the spinal ligaments (bamboo spine). Treatment options in AS are physiotherapy, exercise and slow-release non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g. indomethacin. Most patients manage to lead a normal life, although severe cases may impair ventilation. AS is an example of a seronegative spondyloarthropathy – diseases associated with HLA-B27 that are characterised by a lack of rheumatoid factor (hence “seronegative”). Other spondyloarthropathies are psoriatic arthritis, Reiter disease and enteropathic arthritis. The HLA-DR4 genotype is associated with rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, but not AS.",

    "topic": "Mitral stenosis",
    "explanation": "Mitral stenosis occurs as a result of a chronic autoimmune attack upon the mitral valves. This leads to scar tissue formation, which ultimately tethers the leaflets and prevents them from opening fully. The autoimmune attack is usually triggered by rheumatic fever (group A streptococcus) antibodies cross-reacting with endocardial tissue. Mitral stenosis leads to reduced cardiac output and hence peripheral cyanosis. The apex beat is described as “tapping” because of the increased force in closing the mitral valve. The opening snap in diastole correlates to forced opening of the valve and may be followed by a mid-diastolic murmur. Mitral stenosis leads to left atrial enlargement, and this is related to a bifid P-wave (P mitrale) on the ECG. The P-wave is bifid due to the presence of a larger P-wave (left atrium) superimposed on a smaller one (right atrium). Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy leads to a double impulse apex beat.",

The fact that the forehead is not spared means that there is lower motor neuron weakness, and the lack of any other neurological symptoms, conditions such as diabetes and vasculitis, or identifiable structural lesion along the path of the seventh nerve, means that the cause is most likely to be idiopathic. It is thought to be an inflammatory process in most cases, causing compression at the facial canal or stylomastoid foramen. Steroids are commonly used in therapy, although the evidence for its efficacy is debated. The same may be said for antiviral therapy. Penicillin-based antibiotics are used in Lyme disease, which is a rare cause of seventh nerve palsy, but there is no evidence of it here (i.e. preceding rash, arthralgia or flu-like symptoms). A dangerous complication of Bell palsy is corneal abrasions, which can happen especially during sleep, and therefore eye protection is recommended. There is no evidence that this man’s symptoms were due to an ischaemic event – the onset over a few days, lack of risk factors and lack of other neurology make this evident – and thus aspirin, dipyridamole, statin therapy and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor would all be inappropriate.",

Multiple myeloma is a multi-system disease that may present with lethargy, bone pain, pathological fracture, renal failure, amyloidosis and pancytopenia due to marrow infiltration. Diagnosis requires two of the following three criteria: 1) marrow plasmacytosis, 2) serum/urinary immunoglobulin-light chains (Bence Jones protein) and 3) skeletal lesions (osteolytic lesions, pepperpot skull and pathological fractures). People who have evidence of serum or urine monoclonal antibodies but do not fulfil the criteria for multiple myeloma are said to have “monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance”, which has a 2% annual risk of transforming into multiple myeloma. The treatment of multiple myeloma aims to improve symptoms and suppress disease activity. Bone pain may be controlled with analgesia, bisphosphonates and orthopaedic intervention. Renal failure, caused by the deposition of light chains within the kidney, is usually managed by promoting fluid intake although renal replacement therapy may be required. Infection, anaemia and bleeding caused by pancytopenia secondary to marrow infiltration can be managed with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, erythropoietin therapy and blood product replacement, respectively.",

    "explanation": "At a CD4 count of <200 cells/mm3, the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related opportunistic infections becomes highly likely (for instance, Pneumocystis pneumonia). Therefore it is recommended that below this level, HAART should be started, typically involving two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as zidovudine and didanosine, and one of either a protease inhibitor such as indinavir or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) such as efavirenz. A higher viral load indicates that the CD4 count is likely to fall more rapidly, and a high viral load with a moderately low CD4 count (such as 300 cells/mm3) can be an indicator to start treatment. Viral load alone however does not as accurately predict onset of opportunistic infection and thus guide treatment. Symptoms of an opportunistic infection alone can indicate starting HAART, however, fever and weight loss are non-specific symptoms. The patient should, of course, be investigated for a cause.",

Tetralogy of Fallot has four defining malformations: 1. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) 2. Pulmonary stenosis that turns the VSD into a right–left shunt, causing cyanosis; acute attacks (due to increases in pulmonary vascular resistance) can be managed by squatting, which raises peripheral vascular resistance and therefore reduces the right–left shunt 3.

    "question": "A 72-year-old man is on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Following a recent chest infection his international normalised ratio (INR) rockets up to 5.2. What was the most likely cause for this?",
    "options": [
      "A. Codeine phosphate",
      "B. Erythromycin",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 14,
    "topic": "Warfarin therapy",
    "explanation": "Warfarin is a common anticoagulant that works by inhibiting an essential step in the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX and X). Anticoagulation is measured using the prothrombin time (PT), which is converted into the INR using the following formula: INR = (measured PT/normal PT) ^ ISI ...where the international sensitivity index (ISI) is a constant number that represents how the particular manufactured batch of tissue factor used in the lab compares to an internationally standardised sample. It is usual for patients on warfarin to have a target INR of 2–4.5 depending on the condition being treated. Warfarin therapy is complicated and some patients develop an inappropriately high INR, which places them at increased risk of bleeding. The most common causes for developing an inappropriately high INR are dosing errors, accidental overdose and drug interaction. Degradation of warfarin is via cytochrome p450 in the liver, which is a common pathway for many other drugs and is also susceptible to inhibition and enhancement. Drugs that are known to potentiate the action of warfarin include antibiotics (including erythromycin), thyroxine, alcohol, antidepressants, aspirin, amioderone and quinine. In this case it is likely that the antibiotics prescribed for the chest infection increased the action of warfarin, causing a significant rise in INR, which placed the patient at risk of a major bleed from minor trauma.",

    "topic": "The painful joint",
    "explanation": "This clinical presentation, with acute monoarthritis and systemic signs suggestive of infection (tachycardia, fever) is septic arthritis until proven otherwise. Empirical intravenous antibiotics should be started as soon as possible, in this instance once joint fluid and blood have been sent for Gram stain and cultures. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause, and so antibiotics with good Gram-positive cover such as flucloxacillin and fusidic acid are amongst those commonly used, but local guidelines should be consulted or the case should be discussed with a microbiologist. If positive, once sensitivities are back you should change the antibiotics as soon as possible, if required. It is imperative that antibiotics are started as soon as possible as septic arthritis can lead to rapid joint destruction, osteomyelitis and even overwhelming sepsis and death. A source for the infection should be sought... Differentials of acute monoarthritis include gout (commonly affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint), pseudogout and sero-negative inflammatory arthritis.",

    "topic": "The unresponsive patient",
    "explanation": "This man appears to be haemodynamically stable and there is no concern that that is about to change, so the fluid challenge may be unnecessary. Running some maintenance fluids for now may be indicated as it is not known how long he may be in a coma. A blood sugar reading of 6 is normal so there is no need for the glucose. His temperature is normal, and whilst it is easy to become cold in the resuscitation room, a Bair hugger is not indicated. Flumazenil is an antidote for benzodiazepines, however it is only used if a witnessed overadministration of benzodiazepines occurs or if respiratory depression happens secondary to benzodiazepines – reversal of benzodiazepine action can precipitate seizures or ventricular arrhythmias, and in those patients with a history of seizures, flumazenil must never be used. With this patient, it seems likely that he has taken an opioid overdose – he has pinpoint pupils and a reduced respiratory rate. Boluses of naloxone 0.8–2 mg intravenously every 2 minutes, titrating to patient response and aiming for a GCS of 13–14, would be indicated and could induce a rapid reversal of coma.",

    "page": 40,
    "topic": "Heart failure (1)",
    "explanation": "Heart failure is a disease of chronic, insidious onset that can first present with shortness of breath, persistent cough or insomnia. The heart fails to maintain adequate cardiac output for a variety of reasons; the harder it tries, the faster it fails. Occasionally, the left ventricle will weaken to the point where it cannot empty efficiently. The subsequent raised end-diastolic volume causes a pre-stretched ventricle, leading to a more forceful contraction (Starling’s law). This alternating strong–weak pattern can be seen in the ECG as pulsus alternans (varying amplitudes of the R-wave). A column of blood builds up proximal to the left ventricle, in the lungs, causing pulmonary oedema. This creates afterload upon the right ventricle, which can lead to tricuspid regurgitation. The bottleneck of blood can extend further, through the right side of the heart and hence JVP is raised (the heart is unable to pull all the blood from the jugular vein through the lungs and the left ventricle). Furthermore, close to the right side of the heart, the inferior vena cava remains full of blood, leading to oedema in the liver (hepatomegaly). Ankle veins swell with blood as the heart fails to suck the blood vertically against gravity. The increased hydrostatic pressure results in fluid extravasation into tissues. The push of a finger is enough to displace this tissue fluid, hence this ankle oedema is pitting. Causes of non-pitting oedema include lymphoedema and pretibial myxoedema.",

    "answer": "E",

    "explanation": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs when inflammatory cytokines and/or lung injury causes capillary permeability to increase and non-fluid overload-related pulmonary oedema. In this case there was no known preceding lung injury and no systemic acute precipitant such as sepsis, shock, haemorrhage or transfusion. The findings of bibasal crackles, however, are consistent with oedema and, whilst the diagnosis is not the most parsimonious, it cannot be entirely ruled out. There has been no vomiting reported to suggest aspiration. A pleural effusion would give stony dull percussion and reduced air entry. This patient is clearly fluid overloaded and so there may be small effusions, but these are unlikely to be the chief cause of breathlessness. The patient is afebrile, and the symmetrical pattern to the crackles goes against (but needn’t rule out) a pneumonia. The patient is in acute renal failure, likely secondary to a combination of the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (she has rheumatoid arthritis) and the recent NSAID overdose, with a background of diabetes. She is fluid overloaded (note the raised JVP), and the busy overnight house officer probably presumed the low urine output and raised creatinine level was due to dehydration (it appears they didn’t read the notes fully) and thus has contributed to the situation.

The mutation is a balanced translocation, which leads to increased tyrosine kinase activity disturbing stem cell kinetics. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder. Its peak incidence is 50–70 years and it is rare in children. There is excessive proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Patients typically have massive splenomegaly, anaemia, bruising and infection on a background of generalised illness. A blood film shows myeloblasts (granulocyte precursors) and granulocytosis. Patients with CML but without the Philadelphia chromosome have a worse prognosis compared to those with the translocation. There are three stages of disease in CML: 1) the chronic phase (which is responsive to treatment), 2) the accelerated phase (where the disease is difficult to control) and 3) the blast crisis phase (where the disease progresses into an acute leukaemia, usually AML). The median survival rate is 5 years. Death usually occurs within months of blast transformation (from bleeding and infection). Chemotherapy is often used and allogeneic stem cell transplantation can provide a cure. Having isolated the gene there is now an effective drug that can block the BCR-ABL gene – imatinib mesylate – which can reverse the effects of the protein and produce remission in 95% of patients with this mutation.",

    "page": 42,
    "topic": "Haematemesis",
    "explanation": "This case presents a young man who is in hypovolaemic shock following a large upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Immediate management in these cases is vital to improving mortality, which is currently about 10% for major bleeds. The aetiology includes gastric or duodenal ulcers, burst oesophageal varices and Mallory–Weiss tears. Initial management relies on effective resuscitation of the patient. Always start with ABC, securing the airway, giving supplementary oxygen, and two large cannulae to ensure rapid fluid infusion is possible. Blood products are the best resuscitative agents – always try to replace like with like – but while you await a cross-match use a colloid infusion or O-negative blood. A catheter should be inserted early during the resuscitation as urine output is a very sensitive marker of renal perfusion. This patient needs to be in a monitored bed while he remains shocked, and so transfer to a ward would not normally be appropriate. Following resuscitation your next actions will depend on aetiology, but if variceal bleeding is suspected an urgent endoscopy and sclerotherapy or banding will be necessary. Alerting the necessary teams at the time of presentation can save vital minutes and ensure that you have the support you need around you.",

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 43,
    "topic": "Failure to thrive",
    "explanation": "Beta-thalassaemia major is an autosomal recessive disorder in which there is a complete lack of production of the haemoglobin chain beta-globin. It occurs mainly in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern families and is due to a point mutation on chromosome 11. Because patients with beta-thalassaemia major have mutations on both alleles and cannot synthesise any beta-globin, they cannot produce functioning adult haemoglobin (HbA – α2β2). This condition typically presents within the first year of life, when the production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF – α2γ2) begins to fall. Affected children become generally unwell and fail to thrive secondary to a severe microcytic anaemia. Ferritin levels are normal since there is no iron deficiency. A compensatory increase in the synthesis of HbF and haemoglobin A2 (HbA2 – α2δ2) occurs, which can be detected on serum electrophoresis. Clinical features include failure to thrive, lethargy, pallor and jaundice. On examination there is often hepatosplenomegaly (secondary to extramedullary haematopoiesis) with bossing of the skull, maxillary prominence and long bone deformity (due to excessive intramedullary haematopoiesis). The treatment of beta-thalassaemia major is with regular blood transfusions, aiming to maintain the haemoglobin concentration above 10 g/dL, or with allogenic bone marrow transplant. Regular iron chelation therapy (with desferrioxamine) is required to prevent iron overload and deposition in vital organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands. If untreated, death is inevitable in the first years of life.",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 43,
    "topic": "Osteoarthritis of the hand",
    "explanation": "Dactylitis simply means inflammation of the digit(s). Dactylitis can be seen in psoriatic arthropathy – the red, swollen, tender fingers are sometimes referred to as “sausage fingers”. Osteophytes at the distal interphalangeal joints are called Heberden nodes and are characteristic of osteoarthritis. Bouchard nodes are osteophytes at the proximal interphalangeal joints and usually appear later than Heberden nodes. Prominent nail fold capillary loops are one of the many skin manifestations of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory disease of the muscle that also affects the skin and is commonly paraneoplastic (i.e. related to an underlying tumour). The prominent ulnar styloid is a change seen in rheumatoid arthritis, which is caused by radial deviation at the wrist joint. Trigger finger is often seen in psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and its aetiology is not entirely clear, but involves disparity between the flexor tendon and its sheath, which prevent extension of the finger. The finger can suddenly snap back into extension, hence the label “trigger finger”. Corticosteroid injection should be tried and is effective in many cases, failing which surgery can release the tendon from its sheath.",

Co-amoxiclav has good Gram-positive and -negative cover as well as much anaerobic cover, so is a widely used antibiotic in many scenarios, however, its broad-spectrum characteristic means it disturbs the gut flora and can predispose to Clostridium difficile infection. Flucloxacillin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic with only Gram-positive cover and is often used in staphylococcal infections. Gentamicin has predominantly Gram-negative cover although it has some Gram-positive cover. Metronidazole has wide anaerobic cover and is often used in surgery due to the presence of anaerobes in the bowel.",

Pleural effusion is categorised into exudative effusion (increased microvascular pressure due to disease of the pleural surface, or injury in the adjacent lung) and transudative effusion (increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased osmotic pressure). Light’s criteria states that pleural fluid is an exudate if one or more of the following criteria are met: 1) pleural fluid protein:serum protein ratio >0.5, 2) pleural fluid LDH:serum LDH ratio >0.6, and 3) pleural fluid LDH >two-thirds of the upper limit of normal serum LDH. The causes of exudative effusions include tuberculosis, pneumonia, malignant diseases, pulmonary infarction, rheumatoid disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and acute pancreatitis. The causes of transudative effusions include heart failure, renal failure, liver failure and hypoalbuminaemia.

The more potent the steroid, the more likely it is to have side effects such as skin atrophy, striae and increased risk of infection. Subsequently, the more potent the topical steroid, the less time it should be used for. Hydrocortisone is a mild steroid, eumovate a moderate steroid, betnovate a potent steroid, and dermovate is a very potent steroid. Prednisolone is an oral steroid, and if the dermovate does not get on top of the eczema, there may be a case for using systemic oral steroids – although they are not normally used in eczema and carry a greater risk of side effects when used: patients can become cushingoid, hypertensive, diabetic, immunosuppressed, osteoporotic, and may develop steroid-induced psychosis.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 45,
    "topic": "Skin lesion (2)",
    "explanation": "Itchy erythematous skin could be due to a number of things, including eczema and psoriasis, but two features point to another diagnosis. Firstly, the spreading from a starting point, rather than patches appearing at the same time or cropping up in unrelated positions over time, suggests infection. Secondly, the honey or golden crust is a purulent discharge. Both features are classical of impetigo. Impetigo is a contagious, superficial infection caused most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. The infection spreads when lesions burst to release an exudate, which spreads the bacteria outwards and leaves behind the crust. Swabs should be taken for microscopy, culture, and most importantly sensitivities. In contained infections, topical antibiotics can be prescribed, but in more widespread disease, systemic antibiotics should be used. Antibiotics with good activity against Staphylococci, such as flucloxacillin, should be used pending sensitivities. Antihistamines can be prescribed to help with itching. Underlying skin disease, such as eczema, can predispose. Erysipelas is a superficial form of cellulitis with a well-demarcated edge to the patch of warm, tender erythema. It can spread more rapidly. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome follows infection with group 2 coagulase-positive staphylococci, and a circulating toxin causes epidermal splitting in the granular layer, leading to peeling of the epidermis in large sections. A focus of infection should be sought, and systemic flucloxacillin should be started. It normally develops over a period of hours to days.",

    "topic": "Management of Parkinson’s disease (2)",
    "explanation": "The fall happened soon after he stood up, involved a brief loss of consciousness, and he had an excess sympathetic discharge shortly afterwards. It certainly sounds like an episode of postural hypotension. Standing up requires a significant degree of autonomic nervous system function to detect and react to the intravascular volume redistribution. As L-DOPA is a precursor in the synthesis of not only dopamine but also noradrenaline, excess peripheral noradrenaline and dopamine can cause widespread autonomic dysfunction, symptoms of which include nausea and postural hypotension. Hallucinations can occur with L-DOPA but are unlikely to cause a fall, and dyskinetic movements could cause a fall but don’t explain the loss of consciousness. Multiple system atrophy (MSA), a Parkinson-plus syndrome, indeed includes prominent autonomic dysfunction, however it is extremely rare and would be less likely to respond well to L-DOPA therapy (as this man has).",

The name derives from the sense that appears as if a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) were rotating in time around the isoelectric baseline (i.e. rising out of the page with positive amplitude, rotating toward the reader and falling back in with negative amplitude). The expression was first coined in 1966 by Francois Dessertenne. Torsades de pointes is significant in that it can both lower arterial blood pressure (leading to syncope) and is a precursor to ventricular fibrillation and therefore sudden death. It can be caused by drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants and amiodarone and is also associated with long QT syndrome (a congenital condition), malnutrition and alcohol abuse.

    "page": 46,
    "topic": "Bruising in children",
    "explanation": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common leukaemia in children and is caused by the abnormal clonal proliferation of lymphoid precursor (blast) cells that have been arrested at an early stage of development. The blast cells infiltrate the marrow and lymphoid tissue causing pancytopenia and lymphadenopathy, respectively. ALL is commonest in childhood with peak incidence at 3–4 years. The central nervous system can also be affected causing headache, vomiting, meningism, cranial nerve palsies and seizure. The marrow failure and subsequent pancytopenia produces the common features of anaemia, bleeding/bruising and infection. Bone pain is another common presenting symptom. A full blood count confirms anaemia and thrombocytopenia, but demonstrates a high white cell count (due to circulating blast cells). The investigation of choice is bone marrow aspiration, which shows a hypercellular marrow with >20% blast cells. Lumbar puncture is often also necessary in the initial setting to detect cerebral involvement. Treatment is supportive with measures (such as transfusion and antibiotics) and with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is traditionally delivered in three main stages: remission induction, consolidation and maintenance, which can be for a number of years. Since patients with ALL are at high risk of neurological disease they are often given central nervous system prophylaxis in the form of intrathecal methotrexate and radiotherapy. The prognosis of ALL is good with appropriate treatment and 95% of children can be expected to achieve remission.",

    "explanation": "This patient has herpes zoster infection. Herpes zoster is caused by the varicella zoster virus, which is responsible for chickenpox. After an episode of chickenpox, the virus resides in dorsal root ganglia and can be transported retrogradely along the sensory axons to emerge and cause herpes zoster, most commonly in a dermatomal distribution (although it can be diffuse, usually in immunosuppressed patients). It appears most commonly on the trunk and is called “shingles”, however it can affect branches of the trigeminal nerve, most commonly the ophthalmic, where it can also cause conjunctivitis, keratitis or iridocyclitis. Concurrent illness or immunosuppression can trigger zoster, and it is more common in the elderly. Many episodes will resolve spontaneously after around 2 weeks so the decision to treat depends on severity. Oral aciclovir is usually the first port of call, although intravenous aciclovir can be used in disseminated zoster. Topical acyclovir or steroids are unlikely to help, and topical antibiotics are not indicated unless there is concurrent bacterial infection.",

    "explanation": "Coarctation of the aorta is accurately diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography. An ECG does not normally show any diagnostic changes. Collateral vessels may be visible around the scapulae. Upper limb pulses are stronger than lower limb pulses and this can be an indicator of coarctation in the absence of peripheral vascular disease (unlikely in a 14-year-old) but only if the brachial artery assessed is proximal to the coarctation. The coarctation may reside between the right brachiocephalic artery and the left subclavian artery leading to radial pulse asymmetry, or distal to them both leading to radio-femoral delay. A reduced ankle brachial pressure index may also be present.",

    "explanation": "The pharmacological management of chronic asthma follows a stepwise approach. There are five steps in the management. In step 1, patients with mild intermittent asthma are prescribed an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist. If there has been an exacerbation of asthma in the last 2 years, if patient uses inhaled beta-2 agonists three times a week or more, or if patient reports symptoms three times a week or more, then inhaled corticosteroids should be added on (Step 2). In step 3, if the patient‘s asthma control remains poor despite adequate dose ICS (like this patient on 800mcg/day), an add-on therapy should be considered such as a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA). If the long-acting beta-2 agonist is not working, addition of other therapies such as leukotriene receptor antagonists or theophylline can be considered. In step 4, the inhaled corticosteroid can be increased to 2000 μg/day as well as the addition of a fourth drug (e.g. leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophylline) if symptoms persist. The final step involves continuous or frequent use of oral prednisolone. Osteoporosis can be prevented by using bisphosphonates. Once asthma control is established, the dose of the inhaled or oral corticosteroid should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control can be achieved.",

The protein level can be elevated, but this is rather non-specific. Whilst no single specific antigen has been identified in multiple sclerosis, antibodies to various myelinating cell-associated proteins have been found in patients with multiple sclerosis, myelin basic protein among them. However, testing for this autoantibody alone would not be sensitive enough. Oligoclonal bands on electrophoresis are found in 50–60% of patients after the first attack, and up to 95% of patients with established disease. Whilst this isn’t entirely MS specific, being found in chronic meningitis, neurosarcoidosis and rare infectious nervous system diseases, they persist indefinitely in MS unlike the other disorders, and when combined with an appropriate clinical picture are highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis.",

The diffuse small opacifications sound like miliary tuberculosis, which suggests a blood-borne dissemination that will usually be more acute in onset and tuberculosis may be affecting other organs.

In HIT, the platelet count reduces around 5 to 14 days after the initial exposure (consistent with the timing here).

Patients present with a dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, weight loss and night sweats. Bronchoalveolar lavage involves bronchoscopy and thus is quite invasive, but it is highly sensitive and 90% specific (95% with biopsy) for detecting the organism. Radiological changes can be conspicuously absent early on. Sputum cytology on sputum obtained by hypertonic saline nebuliser induction is specific although less sensitive than bronchoalveolar lavage – as low as 30% sensitive. Hypoxaemia on the arterial blood gas is a non-specific finding. The other advantage of bronchoalveolar lavage is that it will be specific in the diagnosis of other HIV-related pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis.",

NSAIDs commonly cause gastric erosions and ulceration and therefore should be avoided or used with PPI cover in patients with a history of previous gastric ulcers or those taking concomitant aspirin due to the increased risk of severe gastrointestinal bleeding. NSAIDs can cause fluid retention and worsen renal function, so should be avoided in patients with moderate or severe heart failure or significant renal impairment.

    "explanation": "Active or chronic infection (A) is a contraindication, as the required immunosuppression could lead to extreme worsening of infection. Malignancy (C) not only could spread to the transplant, but it could become worse with immunosuppression and the patient is also likely to have a shortened life expectancy. If the iliac vessels are stenosed (D), the transplanted kidney is unlikely to be perfused well enough to function properly. Severe ischaemic heart disease (E) is a contraindication due to surgical risk and limited life expectancy. Posterior urethral valves (B) can affect male newborns, and can be mild or severe in their obstruction of the urinary tract. Without timely intervention, the urinary tract can become high pressure and the kidneys can fail. Transplanting a new kidney onto a high-pressure tract is likely to accelerate failure of the transplant. However, this needn’t prevent transplant; if it is a severe problem, an ileal conduit or neobladder can be formed as an alternative to the high-pressure tract. Therefore, it's not an absolute contraindication itself, but requires management.",

Flushing the catheter with some warm saline and then aspirating may dislodge the clot and allow urine and smaller clots to pass. If this needs repeated flushing, a larger 3-way catheter for continuous irrigation might be needed. Removing the catheter alone won't resolve the blockage. Inserting a suprapubic catheter is more invasive. An ultrasound might be done later, but flushing the catheter is the immediate diagnostic and therapeutic step.

Subdural haematoma commonly presents with a subacute or chronic decline in GCS, confusion, and potentially focal neurology, often days after the initial injury. Meningitis is less likely given stable obs and lack of meningism. Lacunar infarct typically presents acutely without GCS drop. SAH usually presents acutely with severe headache/meningism.

On examination, he has a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg, +++ blood on urine dipstick, and blood tests reveal a creatinine of 170 μmol/L and normal electrolytes.\nWhat is the clinical picture most consistent with?",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 82,
    "topic": "Haematuria",
    "explanation": "Nephritic syndrome may be defined as a triad of haematuria (which can be microscopic or macroscopic), hypertension, and a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. Along with the reduction in glomerular filtration rate and associated oliguria, oedema can be a feature, both peripheral and pulmonary, and proteinuria may also be present. Our patient needs to be investigated for a cause of his nephritic syndrome and referred to a renal physician. As well as routine bloods, ESR and CRP need to be tested to look for an inflammatory cause. Serum and urine should be sent for electrophoresis (to rule out myeloma), and a renal screen including complement (C3 and C4 – can be reduced in active lupus), anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies, anti-streptolysin-O titre (for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (Goodpasture syndrome), and hepatitis serology. Urine should also be sent for 24-hour protein quantification (to look for concominant nephrotic syndrome) and microscopy (to look for casts). The most common glomerulonephritis in the western world is Berger disease, which is an IgA nephropathy. It usually affects young men after an upper respiratory tract infection. If renal impairment is ongoing, immunosuppression can be indicated.\nNephrotic syndrome is a triad of proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema – oedema is not a clinical feature here, and proteinuria was not found. Nephrotic syndrome, however, can often occur with nephritic syndrome – both are commonly caused by glomerulonephritides – and so it should be tested for (with either a 24-hour urine protein quantification or a urine protein creatinine ratio). Renal calculi can cause haematuria but is associated with severe pain.\nAcute tubular necrosis is a form of acute renal injury usually following renal ischaemia, due to dehydration, sepsis, hypotension or renal vascular disease. As such, it is common in hospital practice when pre-renal acute renal failure has not been sufficiently addressed. It can also rarely be caused by direct damage from drugs including aminoglycosides and lithium. There is no reason to believe that any of these drugs or causes of renal hypoperfusion have taken place. Haematuria and hypertension are not typical features of acute tubular necrosis.",

    "explanation": "Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside extracted from the foxglove Digitalis lanata, is an inotrope. By blocking the sodium/potassium pump, it causes a rise in intracellular sodium which, via sodium–calcium exchange, increases the intracellular concentration of calcium and hence contractility. As a result of the increased effort of myocardial contraction, atrio-ventricular node delay is increased and heart rate is indirectly slowed.\nDigoxin has been shown to relieve symptoms of heart failure without necessarily improving mortality but it is the only inotrope that does not actually increase mortality.",

    "topic": "Hodgkin’s lymphoma",
    "explanation": "Hodgkin’s lymphoma has a bimodal age distribution with peak incidences occurring in the third and sixth decades. Is it usually of B-cell origin and is associated with a history of glandular fever. It classically presents with asymmetrical painless lymphadenopathy usually in the form of a single rubbery lymph node in the cervical, axillary or inguinal region that may become painful after alcohol ingestion. Disease spread to the mediastinal nodes may cause dyspnoea and superior vena cava obstruction. Approximately 20% of patients suffer systemic symptoms such as weight loss, sweating, fever, pruritis and general lethargy. These are known as “B” symptoms and are associated with a worse prognosis. Diagnosis is usually based on lymph node biopsy showing pathognomonic Reed–Sternberg cells (large malignant B-cells). CT scanning is used to assess spread, and staging is by the Ann Arbor system (I=one node region involved, II=2+ ipsilateral regions, III=bilateral node involvement, IV=extranodal disease). The presence or absence of B symptoms is indicated in the staging by the suffix “A” (B symptoms absent) or “B” (B symptoms present). Early-stage disease is usually managed with radiotherapy alone. In advanced and bulky disease the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is often employed. The prognosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma is usually good, with a 70% chance of cure even in late-stage disease. Increasing age indicates a poorer prognosis.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman with a 1-year history of plaque psoriasis is having difficulty with management. Along with emollients, she has tried tar and dithranol, which she did not get on well with (due to the smell and burning, respectively), and has been using a combination of vitamin D analogues and Betnovate™, a potent topical steroid. She has difficulty finding time with her lifestyle to apply the creams often enough and as a result the lesions have become more widespread and she is now extremely concerned about her appearance, both in the workplace and at her sister’s wedding, which is coming up soon.\nWhich of the following would be the best treatment to try next?",

      "E. Ultraviolet therapy"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 83,
    "topic": "Management of psoriasis",
    "explanation": "There are a range of topical therapies available for psoriasis, and it can often take an amount of experimentation to find the right combination for each patient. Compliance with laborious application of creams is an issue and patients differ widely in their approach. Tar is an effective therapy, especially crude tar, but stickiness, messiness and smell mean that most patients do not like taking it. Dithranol is often used as first-line medication in chronic plaque psoriasis, however it can burn the skin (especially around the eyes) and can permanently stain clothes so needs to be used carefully. Potent steroids can be used, although they may induce a rebound phenomenon whereby lesions become worse than previously on stopping the topical steroids.\nUltraviolet therapy can be a useful next step in treatment for widespread psoriasis, as it can often rid a patient entirely of lesions without laborious cream application. The plaques often come back, however, at different rates and to different extents. It should not be given too many times in a person’s life due to theoretical risk of skin cancers. It can result in sunburn, and so patients often start at a low dose and then increase the dose until the ultraviolet (UV) rays induce some erythema but not burn. Side effects and need for monitoring are markedly less than with use of systemic therapies such as methotrexate, prednisolone, ciclosporin and biological agents such as infliximab, and these should be withheld for severe psoriasis refractory to topical and UV therapies.",

    "explanation": "Xanthochromia describes a straw-coloured appearance of the cerebrospinal fluid in subarachnoid haemorrhages caused by the presence of haemoglobin breakdown products, and as such requires at least 6 hours before detection. LP at 12 hours is 95% sensitive when spectrophotometry is used to look for xanthochromia. Therefore LP on admission may not be likely to show xanthochromia. Focal weakness may indeed ensue, either from haematoma or from arterial constriction or occlusion 4–12 days post event – the surrounding blood clot, oedema and inflammatory factors induce vasoconstriction and further vessel inflammation, which could thus cause ischaemic brain damage. Of those making it into hospital, 10% present with new seizures. Extreme exertion and coitus may cause rupture of a cerebral aneurysm by sudden drastic increases in intracranial pressure. Unenhanced CT shows 95% of subarachnoid haemorrhages within 48 hours – blood enhances whiter than the surrounding brain matter due to the increased density of radio-opaque iron.",

This is a significant and potentially life-threatening overdose that will require treatment with naloxone. Naloxone competes with opiates for the mu receptors.

    "explanation": "Aortic stenosis can be a cause of shortness of breath and syncope due to reduced cardiac output. Post-fall back pain is very common and is simply due to trauma in this case. Ejection systolic murmurs are the classic sign of aortic stenosis, as blood is ejected through the narrowed valvular orifice under enough pressure to generate turbulent noise. The most common cause of aortic stenosis is age-related calcification. Congenital bicuspid aortic valves are also vulnerable to calcification (prevalence 1–2%), and many people have underdone aortic valve replacement surgery, including actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robin Williams. Rheumatic fever (post-streptococcal autoimmune attack of valve tissue) also increases calcification.\nAortic stenosis can also lead to heart failure, angina and Heyde syndrome (colonic angiodysplasia and lower gastrointestinal bleeding associated with aortic stenosis). In the latter case, valve stenosis leads to von Willebrand disease (vWD) type 2A, possibly as the large von Willebrand platelet coagulation factor (vWF) molecule suffers shear stress as it traverses the aortic valve.",

    "explanation": "Whilst we are not presented with a thorough history, and theoretically the man could have suffered multiple insect bites over the past few weeks, this would be extremely unusual, and even more so for the patient to not mention that he is living under constant assault. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are both most often secondary to drug reactions, and we are not given a history of recent new medications started around the time of the start of disease. Stevens–Johnson syndrome is an extreme form of erythema multiforme (which gives classical “target lesions”), with bullae and systemic involvement including the pulmonary and renal systems, often with an extremely acute onset (rather than the subacute onset over weeks with which the man presented). Toxic epidermal necrolysis involves rapid widespread loss of large areas of the epidermis. Pemphigus does not present with such large, tense blisters, but rather with flaccid blisters and erosions in erythematous patches. These burst easily and heal very slowly. The Nikolsky sign, in which the skin of the blister can be made to slide off with the push of a finger, is characteristic in pemphigus. Oral involvement is very common. These are all in contrast to pemphigoid, which is far more common. They are both of autoimmune aetiology and the pathological difference is the site of the splitting – in pemphigus, the split is within the epidermis, whereas in pemphigoid the split is at the dermoepidermal junction. This is easily remembered as follows: pemphiguS = Superficial, pemphigoiD = Deep. Treatment of pemphigoid is with moderate doses of oral corticosteroids and often steroid-sparing immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine.",

    "explanation": "Tendon rupture has been reported rarely with quinolones such as ciprofloxacin. The risk is increased in elderly patients and when corticosteroids are used concurrently. Co-amoxiclav can cause a derangement in liver function tests with a cholestatic picture, occasionally leading to jaundice, but withdrawal of the antibiotic usually leads to resolution. Macrolides such as erythromycin increase gastrointestinal motility and thus commonly cause diarrhoea, however this has led to their intentional use as a prokinetic anti-emetic. Gentamicin can cause significant renal damage and hence the serum level of gentamicin is monitored during its use – increased levels suggest decreased urinary clearance due to nephrotoxicity and the interval between doses should be increased. Nitrofurantoin is no longer commonly used, only being indicated for uncomplicated UTIs, and pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions leading to fibrosis can occur.",

On examination, an enlarged, tender, non-pulsatile temporal artery is seen on the affected side. Temporal artery biopsy is the definitive investigation (shows patchy granulomatous inflammation) but skip lesions may be present and it is therefore possible that the histology is falsely negative. Investigation should not delay treatment with steroids. A CT and MRI of the head would not tell us much about the state of the temporal arteries or whether they are inflamed.

    "topic": "Management of skin lesions (3)",
    "explanation": "This man has a basal cell carcinoma. The most common treatment for basal cell carcinoma is excision, as not only does this commonly remove all malignant cells, but it enables the diagnosis to be made histologically. It is most often done under local anaesthetic and complications are rare. In some circumstances other treatment modalities can be used. Mohs micrographic surgery aims for extremely narrow excision margins and histology is inspected at the time of excision to ensure the borders are clear, with repeat border trimmings until they are clear. This can be useful if there is limited local skin for closure or if there are nearby structures that are best avoided. Radiotherapy can be used to shrink lesions and reduce troublesome bleeding, often in cases where resection is difficult, either because of local invasion into certain structures or because the lesion is so large that flap reconstruction would be necessary and the patient is unsuitable for general anaesthetic. Topical 5-fluorouracil is commonly used for areas of skin with multiple or recurrent actinic keratoses, and can be used in some instances of basal cell carcinoma, although this is a relatively recent development. Chemotherapy has severe side effects and with such a range of effective local treatment options, and as basal cell carcinomas do not metastasise, chemotherapy is entirely excessive and not indicated.",

    "explanation": "Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterised by episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep. Patients experience episodic airway obstruction associated with oxyhaemoglobin desaturation and arousals from sleep. The symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea include chronic snoring, insomnia, gasping and breath holding, non-refreshing sleep and daytime somnolence. Maxillomandibular anomalies, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, an increase in soft palatal and tongue tissue mass due to obesity, and neuromuscular diseases with pharyngeal involvement leading to loss of dilator muscle tone cause narrowing of the upper airway during sleep. Treatment is by continuous positive airway pressure via a face mask during sleep.",

His airway is patent and he has laboured breathing at a rate of 22 breaths/min. His saturations are 98% on air and his chest sounds clear. His pulse is 120 bpm and blood pressure 85/55 mmHg. His capillary refill rate is 4 seconds. His urine output has been 40 ml in the last 5 hours. You see from his blood tests that his creatinine level has increased slightly.

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 87,
    "topic": "Arterial blood gases (1)",
    "explanation": "One of the consequences of acute renal failure is metabolic acidosis, and given that this man’s renal failure was precipitated by sepsis, this is likely to be more marked as sepsis itself can cause metabolic acidosis. We are told that he was fluid resuscitated and treated with intravenous antibiotics, however, either the antibiotics have not been effective (and thus sepsis continues with vasodilation leading to renal hypoperfusion) or the fluid resuscitation has not been aggressive enough, or a combination of the two. His creatinine level has increased slightly and his urine output is very low at 8 ml/hour. His breathing, which is described in the scenario – deep and laboured in the absence of any respiratory problem (clear chest, normal saturations on air) – is called “Kussmaul breathing” and is a natural response to acidosis and aims to reduce the amount of acidic carbon dioxide in the circulation. As can be seen, the only acidotic blood gas reading with a low pCO2 (“partial respiratory compensation”) is option B. Note that the bicarbonate level is low, indicating a metabolic nature to the acidosis. Option A appears to be a respiratory acidosis with no metabolic compensation. Option C appears to be a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a high pO2 – this may be due to oxygen therapy. Option D shows carbon dioxide retention with full metabolic compensation – this may be the blood gas reading of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Option E is respiratory alkalosis with no metabolic compensation – this picture may be caused by a panic attack with hyperventilation in the absence of any bodily disturbance.",

It lacks the correlation with effort of new-onset, stable angina secondary to coronary vascular disease. Any instance of tight chest pain or chest pain of sternal origin should be taken very seriously indeed. It is only because in this case she has not experienced the pain for at least 48 hours that a troponin blood test is not indicated – after this time it will not distinguish between a myocardial infarction (MI) and angina. An echocardiogram will detect valvular lesions and heart defects but it will not identify arrhythmias. Home oxygen is usually prescribed for patients with respiratory disease and chronic hypoxia after a full assessment; a cardiac patient so hypoxic that they need supplemental oxygen should not be sent home. Analysis of the 24-hour or ambulatory ECG will indicate the source of the tachycardia, i.e. supra-ventricular or ventricular (much more serious), which will in turn indicate a management plan that may include permanent pacing.",

In dextrocardia, the apex beat would be palpable on the right. The ECG leads should be reversed to yield a “normal” trace.\nDextrocardia is a congenital condition that may mean a normal heart is situated unusually rightward (dextrocardia of embryonic arrest and, as the name grimly suggests, is associated with malformations) or less commonly occurring as a mirror image on the right (dextrocardia situs inversus). If all internal organs are mirrored, it is known as dextrocardia situs inversus totalis (this is very rare).

    "explanation": "The spinal cord ends with the conus medullaris around L2–L3, below which the dural sac simply contains the cauda equina, nerve roots that will exit at the lower lumbar and sacral spine. Saddle anaesthesia is due to compression of the sensory fibres leaving the spine at S3–S5. The bladder may be distended as detrusor motor paralysis and sensory loss leads to urinary retention. The lower motor neuron nature of the weakness reduces the anal tone, and may lead to reduced or absent ankle reflexes. The plantars would be expected to be downgoing, however.

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 89,

    "explanation": "In enteropathic arthritis, flares happen at the same time as flares of inflammatory bowel disease, and so given the absence of any such symptoms this diagnosis can be excluded. It also most commonly affects large joints of the lower limbs. Diffuse osteoarthritis affecting distal interphalangeal joints occurs far more frequently in postmenopausal females, and 35 years of age is very young for osteoarthritis. Psoriatic arthropathy has a typical onset between the ages of 25 and 40 years, and in 20% of patients it predates the appearance of psoriatic skin lesions (and in 5% there is never any skin involvement).\nIt is a diffuse disease category and there are five major patterns:\n1. Distal interphalangeal joint predominance (seen here, most common in men, and most strongly associated with nail changes – onycholysis is the separation of the nail from the bed seen here, and pitting is also seen)\n2. Asymmetrical oligoarthritis (commonly featuring dactylitis or “sausage fingers”)\n3. Symmetrical polyarthritis (resembling rheumatoid arthritis but less severe and not associated with nodules or other manifestations; it is more common in females)\n4. Psoriatic spondylitis (less severe than ankylosing spondylitis)\n5. Arthritis mutilans (also seen with rheumatoid arthritis; erosion of bone and cartilage in the fingers leads to telescoping).\nReactive arthritis is commonly found following dysentery or Chlamydia infection, and has a marked preponderance for lower limb involvement. It is associated with conjunctivitis in 50% of cases and also a non-specific urethritis (hence the mnemonic “Can’t see, can’t pee, can’t bend a knee”). It is far more common in men than women (15:1). Enteropathic arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy, reactive arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are the seronegative spondyloarthropathies and are heavily associated with HLA-B27, an immune histocompatibility gene (hence the relevance of the brother with Crohn’s disease). Rheumatoid arthritis can be ruled out by the involvement of the distal interphalangeal joints.",

    "explanation": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the commonest autosomal recessive condition in the Caucasian populations in the UK, affecting one in 2500 live births. CF is caused by an abnormal gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR), located on chromosome 7. CFTR is a cAMP-dependent chloride channel blocker. The most common mutation in CF is the ΔF508 mutation. The poor transport of chloride ions and water across epithelial cells of the respiratory and pancreatic exocrine glands in CF results in an increased viscosity of secretions. The range of presentations is varied, including recurrent chest infections, failure to thrive due to malabsorption, and liver disease. In the neonatal period, infants may present with prolonged neonatal jaundice, bowel obstruction (meconium ileus) or rectal prolapse.\nThe gold standard investigation for CF is the sweat test. The abnormal function of sweat glands results in the excess concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) in sweat. Sweat is stimulated by pilocarpine iontophoresis, collected on filter paper and analysed.\nNormal sweat NaCl concentration = 10–14 mmol/L\nSweat NaCl concentration in CF = 80–125 mmol/L\nAt least two sweat tests should be performed, as diagnostic errors and false positives are common.\nManagement options in CF include physiotherapy (for respiratory secretions), antibiotics (for prophylaxis and treatment of lung infections) and pancreatic enzyme supplements (to prevent malabsorption). Complications include diabetes mellitus, hepatic cirrhosis, infertility in males, severe pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, and chronic lung infections (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia). Many cases of CF are now being picked up early since the introduction of a national screening programme assessing immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) levels on the Guthrie card at day 8 of life. IRT is a pancreatic enzyme whose levels are raised in CF.",

    "topic": "Diagnosis of gout",
    "explanation": "Calcium pyrophosphate crystals cause pseudogout. These are positively birefringent crystals and rhomboidal (“brick-shaped”). Apple green birefringence under polarised light is seen in tissues with amyloid deposits and stained with Congo Red. The negatively birefringent crystals of gout are spindle or needle shaped.\nGout occurs secondary to the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joint. It is commonest in older, obese male drinkers with hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes. Other risk factors include cytotoxic drugs, diuretic use and Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (gout + mental retardation + self-mutilating behaviour). Acute episodes of gout can be precipitated by trauma, illness, stress and thiazide diuretics. Acute gout usually presents with sudden pain, swelling and redness in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, although 25% of cases occur in the knee. Diagnosis is by joint aspiration, which shows negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals. Acute gout is treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. indomethacin, diclofenac). Prophylaxis is with allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that slows the production of uric acid. This is offered to patients who have recurrent gout, chronic gout, are using cytotoxic therapy, and those with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Allopurinol should not be prescribed within 1 month of an attack of gout as it may precipitate a further attack. In patients allergic to allopurinol, probenecid is used as prophylaxis.\nOther forms of gout are chronic tophaceous gout (the accumulation of urate in cartilage, often the ear and Achilles tendon) and gout nephropathy (urate deposition in the kidneys resulting in acute renal failure and the formation of urate stones).",

    "topic": "Investigation of shortness of breath (1)",
    "explanation": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blood clot in the lung vasculature. Most PEs (75%) derive from a deep vein thrombosis. Features include acute-onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, often with fever and tachycardia. The chest X-ray may show a wedge-shaped opacity due to consolidation associated with pulmonary infarction (Hampton hump). The Westermark sign is a focus of oligaemia on X-ray distal to an occluded blood vessel. The ECG most commonly demonstrates a sinus tachycardia, although the S1Q3T3 pattern is characteristic (S-wave in lead I, Q-wave and inverted T-wave in lead III). An arterial blood gas reading reveals type 1 respiratory failure (normal pH, low pO2). D-dimers are a breakdown product of clots: a low D-dimer can be used to exclude a PE, but a high level does not confirm it. The next investigation in PE depends on the chest X-ray: if the chest X-ray is clear, a ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scan is performed to look for areas that are getting air but not blood. A normal ventilation–perfusion scan excludes pulmonary embolism in patients with low clinical probability, however a significant minority of high-probability scans are falsely positive. If the chest X-ray is not clear, or if a V/Q scan is inconclusive, a spiral CT (computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)) is the best investigation. Patients with good negative CTPA do not require further investigations and treatment for PE. It could also offer an alternative diagnosis when pulmonary embolism is excluded. Patients with a confirmed PE are started on heparin or low molecular-weight heparin and then warfarinised for 6 months (aiming for an international normalised ratio (INR) of between 2 and 3). Patients who have suffered a massive PE need urgent thrombolysis. Echocardiography is useful in diagnosis of massive PE. Acute dilatation of the right heart is usually present in massive PE with visible thrombus seen.",

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman who works in the city as an investment banker presents with difficulty walking, and a tremor in the right hand. It has come on over the last 4 days and she is now unable to get to work safely. She denies any preceding respiratory or gastrointestinal infection or any abnormal stress at work or in her personal life; however, she says that 5 months ago she had some pain and blurring in the left eye for about 10 days, but she put that down to “sinusitis”, kept working, and things returned to normal. Her grandfather, who died 2 years ago, had Parkinson’s disease for some time, and she is concerned that this could be the same thing. On examination, in her arms, there is normal tone, power and sensation, but there is indeed a tremor in the right hand on testing coordination, which gets worse on approaching the target, and is absent at rest. In the legs, there is normal power, but decreased light touch sensation bilaterally and a loss of vibration sense and proprioception up to the ankles.\nWhat are you most concerned is the diagnosis?",

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 92,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of neurological dysfunction (1)",
    "explanation": "Whilst she is concerned that this is Parkinson’s disease, and there are some rare cases of early-onset familial Parkinson’s disease caused by mutations in a single gene (for instance, alpha-synuclein, the misfolded protein that makes up Lewy bodies), not only is 27 still extremely young, but the clinical picture does not sound like Parkinson’s disease. There is no sensory loss in Parkinson’s disease, and the tremor is absent at rest and gets worse on movement (the opposite of the parkinsonian tremor). The tremor in fact sounds like an intention tremor. Regarding the symptoms being possibly psychogenic, this is common in young patients (especially female), however, there is no history of psychological abnormality, and the examination findings seem reliably reproducible and are consistent with certain anatomical lesions. Psychogenic neurology is often a diagnosis of exclusion after many investigations, although it is worth considering early on in certain patients who may start to deny the possibility of a non-organic cause.\nThe lack of an identified preceding infection does not preclude a postinfectious condition, either peripheral (Guillain–Barré) or central (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis – ADEM), and indeed the subacute onset could fit with such a diagnosis. With the leg symptoms, it is not known whether they are central (spinal cord) or peripheral. However, the intention tremor in the arm with lack of sensory symptoms or examination findings is most likely cerebellar in nature, and the cerebellum is not commonly affected in Guillain–Barré syndrome. Also, whilst Guillain–Barré syndrome can present initially with sensory symptoms, and it has only been 4 days since the start of the episode, weakness is usually a predominant feature and none was demonstrable on examination. This presents the possibility of ADEM or multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most common organic central nervous system disorder in the young, and affects women more than men, so this is the most likely. The feature in the history that supports this is the episode of visual blurring and eye pain (optic neuritis). ADEM is usually a monophasic condition, whereas MS, especially in the younger patients, commonly has a relapsing/remitting course with complete recovery in between relapses.\nIn the optic nerve, the axons conducting messages from the cone cells (colour vision and high acuity central vision) are myelinated, but those conducting messages from rod cells (dark vision and peripheral vision) are not, and so central vision and colour vision are more commonly affected. The eye pain is commonly exacerbated on eye movement as the inflamed optic nerve sheath is stretched, however, this episode was mild and the hard-working patient has worked through it and forgotten such detail, so this is uncertain.",

For that reason, the posterior cerebral artery cannot be the affected artery. The left-hand side of the body is affected, so it must be the right cerebral hemisphere – ruling out any artery on the left. That leaves us the right carotid, anterior cerebral or middle cerebral arteries. The arm and face being affected rules out the anterior cerebral, and the relative sparing of the leg (especially distal) indicates that it is the right middle cerebral artery territory that is affected. The right middle cerebral passes anterolaterally from the circle of Willis to lie on the outside of the hemisphere, before turning to run posteriorly in the Sylvian fissure, supplying the lateral part of all four lobes.",

    "page": 93,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of cough (5)",
    "explanation": "This man has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as evidenced by a decreasing exercise tolerance and productive cough on a background of a smoking history. COPD is a chronic progressive disorder characterised by airflow obstruction. The obstruction may be partially (but not completely) reversible with bronchodilators. COPD encompasses bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis is defined as cough with sputum for most days of a 3-month period on two consecutive years. Emphysema is a pathological diagnosis of permanent destructive enlargement of the alveoli.\nSmoking is the main risk factor, and 15% of smokers develop COPD. The pathology includes hypertrophy of the goblet cells and decreased cilia with loss of alveoli elastic recoil. The persistent hypoxaemia seen in COPD results in pulmonary vascular hypertension, which leads to cor pulmonale. Features of COPD include a productive cough (worse in the mornings), recurrent respiratory tract infections, exertional dyspnoea, expiratory wheeze and bibasal crepitations. Examination may also reveal tracheal tug, intercostal in-drawing, a barrel chest (increased anterior–posterior diameter), pursed lips, central cyanosis, carbon dioxide retention (flapping tremor, bounding pulse and warm peripheries) and right heart failure.\nCOPD is diagnosed by demonstrating a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of <80% and an FEV1/VC (vital capacity) ratio of <70% with little variation in peak flow. The lung capacity and residual volume are increased. Arterial blood gases typically show hypoxia and hypercapnia. A chest X-ray shows hypertranslucent lung fields, a flat diaphragm, bullae and prominent hila. Management options include stopping smoking, antibiotics for infections, regular anticholinergics (ipratropium) and a salbutamol inhaler as required. Smoking cessation can be helped by bupropion, which is prescribed 2 weeks before stopping. Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) of 1–4 L/min via nasal cannulae is given for patients with severe COPD who have given up smoking and who have a pO2 <7.3 kPa and FEV1 <1.5 L. Acute exacerbations of COPD are diagnosed when patients complain of worsening exercise tolerance, increasing sputum volume and increasing sputum purulence. Acute exacerbations of COPD are treated with 24–28% oxygen, nebulised salbutamol, oral prednisolone and prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin. If CO2 is rising or the patient is acidotic despite adequate oxygen therapy, consider ventilator support.",

    "explanation": "The patient has become unwell as a result of the C. difficile-associated diarrhoea and needs treatment. Barrier nursing in a side room is recommended to limit spread of the organism, however it will not treat the patient. Co-amoxiclav and clarithromycin are not used to treat C. difficile, and in fact C. difficile associated diarrhoea often occurs secondary to antibiotic use disturbing the normal bowel flora. Omeprazole can also make infection more likely by reducing acidity of the bowel contents. Therefore, omeprazole and co-amoxiclav should be stopped, however this will not stop the infection now that it has started. The organism remains in the bowel lumen and causes diarrhoea by virtue of the toxin it produces, and intravenous vancomycin does not traverse the bowel wall and so oral vancomycin is the best treatment plan.

In this case the salient features are that the pain occurs on lying down to go to sleep. Although in unstable angina this may occur, you would also expect a patient to report pain on increased exertion as well. A GTN spray may relieve both GORD and angina as the nitrates cause smooth muscle relaxation in the oesophagus as well as coronary arteries.\nGORD is associated with obesity, smoking, alcohol, hernias and pregnancy. Patients generally present with intermittent pain, or heartburn, which may be related to lifestyle factors such as large meals or alcohol. Medications can also contribute and should be reviewed. Endoscopy is not usually indicated for the diagnosis in young, otherwise healthy, patients, however urgent referrals should be considered in anyone over the age of 55 with new-onset symptoms or warning signs of weight loss, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or anaemia.

    "explanation": "Arrhythmias can be categorised as sinus node abnormalities, supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia are common sinus node abnormalities, and the P-waves remain associated with QRS complexes confirming normal functioning of cardiac conduction. The causes usually lie outside of the heart. Supraventricular arrhythmias include atrial ectopic beats, paroxysmal tachycardias (narrow complexes generated below the sino-atrial node but above the ventricles), Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (a separate pathway to the atrioventricular node (AVN) allows pre-excitation and re-entry), atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Atrial flutter is caused by a re-entry pathway allowing rapid re-firing of the ventricles: a rate of 300/min is typical. The AVN will often block some of the beats and additional P-waves appear at a regular rate of 300/min between QRS complexes. Atrial fibrillation is characterised by an irregular heart rate. Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular ectopic beats, torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. A broad QRS complex tachycardia indicates a ventricular arrhythmia (or a supraventricular arrhythmia with bundle branch block). AVN re-entry tachycardia occurs when two pathways co-exist within the AVN. The two pathways may have differing delays which in total, present a raised heart rate of between 140–220 bpm. These paroxysms can be managed with adenosine or verapamil to cause an iatrogenic AVN delay.",

If a battery becomes lodged in the oesophagus, removal is advised to avoid the small chance of oesophageal perforation. Once the object has passed into the stomach the chances of impaction are low.",

    "question": "A 16-year-old boy presents with a 1-year history of acne affecting his face and upper back. He has tried over-the-counter creams and “a few creams prescribed by his GP”, which turn out to be benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic cream. None have worked and the lesions have been getting worse. His friend had treatment with roaccutane (isotretinoin), which sorted it out, and he is keen to try this. On examination he has acne on his face and upper back but without large pustules or scarring.\nWhich therapy might you recommend trying before isotretinoin?",

    "topic": "Management of acne (2)",
    "explanation": "Cyproterone acetate is an anti-androgen that may only be given to women, so it is contraindicated here. Topical steroid creams may be used when there are focal severe lesions, whereas this patient has diffuse but non-severe lesions. Oral prednisolone may only be used in severe cases, often where isotretinoin has not been fully effective. Systemic antibiotic therapy can be effective at clearing up acne, and often should be prescribed for over 6 months. Fat-soluble antibiotics are better delivered to the target (therefore penicillins are not preferred). Rather, tetracyclines or sometimes erythromycin are used.",

    "explanation": "Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space. It can occur spontaneously in healthy people (primary spontaneous pneumothorax) or in patients with pre-existing lung disease (secondary spontaneous pneumothorax). It can also result from iatrogenic injury or trauma to the lung or chest wall. Management of pneumothorax depends on the size of pneumothorax, clinical symptoms and underlying lung disease. The size of pneumothorax is divided into small or large depending on the size of the visible rim of air between the lung margin and the chest wall: <2 cm or ≥2 cm. Observation without any intervention is advised for small, closed, and mildly symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothoraces and these patients do not require hospital admission. In patients with asymptomatic small secondary pneumothoraces, it is recommended to be admitted into hospital for observation. In patients with symptomatic primary or secondary pneumothoraces, active intervention is required as it may herald tension pneumothorax. Simple aspiration is recommended as first-line treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention and mildly symptomatic small (<2 cm) secondary pneumothoraces. Intercostal tube drainage is recommended as first-line intervention in other symptomatic secondary pneumothoraces as they may cause respiratory failure. Tube drainage is also used if simple aspiration fails to control symptoms in any pneumothorax.

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 97,
    "topic": "Signs of liver disease (1)",
    "explanation": "Dupuytren contracture is a progressive fibroplasia of the palmar facia that results in a flexion contracture of the fingers. It is most common in the ring and little fingers. Risk factors include the male sex, a family history, diabetes mellitus, alcoholic cirrhosis, phenytoin use, trauma, acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS), Peyronie disease (idiopathic fibrosis of the corpus cavernosum) and Ledderhose disease (fibrosis of the plantar fascia, resulting in a similar deformity) On examination the thickened palmar aponeurosis can be felt. Treatment is by excision of the thickened part of the aponeurosis.\nTrigger finger is characterised by difficulty in extension of a finger caused by a disparity in size between the flexor tendon sheath and the tendon within it. The finger remains flexed until passively extended with a “click”. There is no association with alcohol excess.\nAsterixis describes a jerking flexion–extension movement of the hand seen when the arms are placed in an outstretched position with the wrists cocked back.

It has a number of potential advantages, particularly the avoidance of tracheal intubation with its associated mortality and morbidity from problems such as pneumonia. According to the guidelines on non-invasive ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (management of acute type 2 respiratory failure published by the British Thoracic Society) the inclusion criteria are: 1) primary diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation (known diagnosis or history and examination consistent with diagnosis); 2) ability to protect airway; 3) patient is conscious and cooperative; 4) potential for recovery to quality of life acceptable to the patient; and 5) patient’s wishes are considered.

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 98,
    "topic": "Medications in hyperkalaemia",
    "explanation": "Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker commonly used in hypertension and does not affect serum potassium. Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic and actually lowers serum potassium. Whilst it is largely ineffective at lowering blood pressure in renal failure, it may be reducing the serum potassium and so shouldn’t be stopped. Furosemide is a loop diuretic, which also lowers serum potassium. If this man has come in with acute renal failure caused by hypovolaemia, furosemide should probably be stopped. Simvastatin is a statin and does not affect serum potassium. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and will increase the serum potassium, and for this reason it should be stopped in renal failure, especially here, where the potassium level is raised. A serum potassium level of 5.5 mmol/L is not too high, but it should be checked that potassium is not being added to the patient’s fluid prescription, as well as confirming that he is asymptomatic and checking his electrocardiogram (ECG) for changes.",

    "page": 98,
    "topic": "Tumour markers",
    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis in this case is ovarian carcinoma for which CA 125 is a tumour marker. The clinical features of ovarian malignancy include weight loss, abdominal pain, increasing abdominal girth and ascites. Unfortunately, the symptoms of ovarian malignancy usually occur late, meaning the disease is often advanced and metastatic at presentation. Diagnosis usually involves transvaginal ultrasound scanning, computed tomography (CT) imaging, ovarian biopsy and measurement of CA 125. Both chemotherapy and surgery have a role in the management of ovarian cancer and have both curative and palliative roles. Radiotherapy is now limited to the palliation of symptoms. Because ovarian malignancy usually presents late the prognosis of ovarian cancer is poor. However, if the disease is diagnosed early and treated appropriately survival rates for early-stage disease can be as high as 95% at 5 years.\nOther examples of tumour markers include:\nAlpha-fetoprotein Æ hepatocellular carcinoma, germ cell tumours\nBeta-hCG Æ choriocarcinoma, testicular tumours\nCa 15-3 Æ breast cancer\nCa 19-9 Æ pancreatic cancer\nCalcitonin Æ medullary thyroid cancer\nCarcinoembryonic antigen Æ colorectal tumours\nMonoclonal IgG (paraprotein) Æ multiple myeloma\nNeurone-specific enolase Æ small cell lung cancer\nPlacental alkaline phosphatase Æ ovarian carcinoma, testicular tumours\nProstate-specific antigen Æ prostate cancer\nS-100 Æ malignant melanoma\nThyroglobulin Æ thyroid tumours",

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 98,
    "topic": "Parkinson’s disease",
    "explanation": "Parkinson’s disease symptoms are mainly caused by a lack of dopamine in the basal ganglia, secondary to a loss of midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta neurons. Models of basal ganglia function suggest that they take inputs concerning “motor plans” from the motor and cognitive frontal cortex, and then the dopamine acts as a gate to allow those motor plans to be executed. Hence, bradykinesia is a prominent symptom and is mostly related to the loss of dopamine. Postural instability appears late in the disease, and may be seen as a lack of ability to voluntarily adjust position in response to postural disturbance. Rigidity is classically either “lead-pipe” (stiff throughout range of movement) or “cogwheel” (essentially, lead-pipe rigidity with the tremor superimposed). The tremor of Parkinson’s disease is the most common feature, and is usually unilateral and about 3–4 Hz in frequency. It may take the form of the classic “pill-rolling” tremor. A tremor of 10–12 Hz seems too fast for Parkinson’s disease, and other causes such as familial or essential tremor should be considered. Postural hypotension may occur, but is more commonly a side effect of levodopa (L-DOPA) therapy, or associated with the “Parkinson-plus” syndrome, which is multiple system atrophy. Micrographia (small writing) and mask-like facies are features of Parkinson’s disease but are less important diagnostically and functionally than the four main features.",

    "topic": "Investigation of hepatomegaly",
    "explanation": "The classical triad of haemochromatosis is bronze skin pigmentation, hepatomegaly and diabetes mellitus. Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by excess iron deposition in various organs throughout the body, which leads to their fibrosis and dysfunction. This question picks up on many of these complications: heart arrhythmias and possible heart failure; and skin pigmentation due to iron deposition in the hypothalamus leading to excess melanin production and hypogonadism. Iron deposition in the liver leads to acute liver failure, whereas deposition in the pancreas leads to failure of its endocrine or exocrine function. Joints are generally affected in an asymmetrical fashion. The diagnosis of haemochromatosis is made firstly from the haematinics, in which you would expect to see a raised ferritin, a reduced total iron binding capacity (due to saturation) and a transferrin saturation >60%.",

    "explanation": "Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy is the provision of oxygen therapy for continuous use at home for patients with chronic hypoxaemia of PaO2 at or below 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg), nocturnal hypoventilation, and for palliative use. Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy can be prescribed in patients with chronic hypoxaemia with a PaO2 between 7.3 kPa and 8 kPa in the presence of pulmonary hypertension or secondary polycythaemia. The aim of therapy is to increase the PaO2 to at least 8 kPa (60 mmHg) or to attain saturations of at least 90%. Studies have shown long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy used for ≥15 hours/day in patients with COPD and chronic severe hypoxaemia improves survival, reduces secondary polycythaemia and prevents progression of primary pulmonary hypertension. For patients who are eligible for long-term oxygen therapy, three factors should be considered: 1. There should be a clinical diagnosis of a disorder associated with chronic hypoxaemia. 2. Patients should be on optimum medical treatment for a particular condition and clinically stable for at least 5 weeks. 3. Arterial blood gas tensions must be measured on two occasions, not less than 3 weeks apart. The patient should have stopped smoking and be made aware of the dangers of smoking in the presence of home oxygen therapy.",

    "explanation": "This woman has stable angina. GTN spray sublingually causes peripheral vasodilatation, reducing afterload and resting her myocardium. Oxygen will ensure that what blood is perfusing her myocardium is well oxygenated, staving off hypoxia and its resultant anginal pain. Morphine is useful in calming the patient and reducing the unhelpful adrenal stimulus upon the heart. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that will serve to cap the heart rate by blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors. Salbutamol nebulisers are not only of no benefit in this scenario (the patient does not have restricted airways) but it also has functions as a beta-agonist, slightly stimulating the heart to work harder.",

    "explanation": "Ciprofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, is contraindicated in pregnancy, as animal studies have shown development of arthropathy in the child. Tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, bind calcium and thus become deposited in growing bones and teeth, limiting growth and staining teeth. Trimethoprim is a folate antagonist and thus carries risk of teratogenicity. Vancomycin would have to be given intravenously, whereas this woman shows no indication of need for admission. This drug can cause severe side effects so is reserved for dangerous or resistant organisms, and it has only Gram-positive cover, whereas 75% of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative organism. Co-amoxiclav provides good Gram-positive and -negative cover and is commonly used in UTIs. Penicillins are not known to be harmful in pregnancy.",

    "topic": "Left ventricular hypertrophy",
    "explanation": "The heart can face an increased afterload in aortic stenosis, hypertension and raised peripheral vascular resistance. Its response, like any muscle, is to develop increased strength and therefore bulk. A larger muscle radiates a larger depolarisation charge, manifesting in an increased QRS amplitude and left axis deviation. This creates two problems: coronary arteries must traverse and support a thickened myocardium and end-diastolic volume is reduced as the larger myocardium intrudes upon the ventricular chamber. This can lead to acute coronary syndrome, signs of which include T-wave inversion. A pansystolic murmur can be a sign of mitral regurgitation, which is associated with left ventricular dilatation.",

    "answer": "D",
    "page": 128,
    "topic": "Overdose and antidotes",
    "explanation": "Paracetamol is widely available, cheap and extremely toxic in overdose. It is one of the most common drugs implicated in intentional overdose and is usually taken in combination with alcohol and other substances. There are usually no initial symptoms of paracetamol overdose, which often leads to the patient believing they have caused no harm. Late features of overdose include vomiting, abdominal pain, bruising, jaundice and encephalopathy. If a patient presents with paracetamol overdose, a serum paracetamol level should be tested 4 hours after the overdose was taken in addition to a full blood count, liver function tests, glucose and a coagulation screen. When a therapeutic dose of paracetamol is taken, the hepatotoxic metabolites are conjugated with glutathione, which neutralises their toxicity. In paracetamol overdose the endogenous glutathione pathways become saturated, allowing the hepatotoxic metabolites to build up and cause hepatic necrosis. N-acetylcysteine is the first-line antidote in paracetamol overdose and works by restoring the levels of glutathione, which conjugates and neutralises the toxins. It should ideally be started within 8 hours of the patient taking the overdose but can be given up to 24 hours after the overdose. If a patient presents more than 24 hours after overdose a specialist liver unit should be contacted for advice. The decision to treat with N-acetylcysteine is usually based upon the serum paracetamol level taken at least 4 hours after the overdose.",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 129,
    "topic": "Murmur",
    "explanation": "Benign murmurs are common, especially in children. A Still murmur is a soft, ejection systolic murmur that disappears on sitting up (it is benign). Young children require vigorous cardiac output through comparatively narrow vessels; this can lead to a pulmonary flow murmur. The increased pulmonary vein pressure can lead to a delay in pulmonary valve closure – a split second heart sound. In children, the jugular vein walls can vibrate with the comparatively brisk venous circulation; this is known as a venous hum and is also benign. Fractured arms do not cause heart problems other than by secondary hypovolaemia – and dad would not be calm if this was the case! Ventricular septal defects are the commonest congenital cardiac defect and may present as a soft pansystolic murmur. If large, corrective surgery will be indicated; large defects ultimately cause cyanosis as an initial left-right shunt leads to an increased pulmonary vascular resistance reversing the shunt (and ending the cyanosis) – Eisenmenger syndrome. This will become a life-threatening problem and needs to be corrected.",

    "explanation": "Management of diabetes mellitus includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological treatment, including oral hypoglycaemics and insulin. Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, having a healthy diet, and alcohol consumption reduction could improve glycaemic control. The aim of pharmacological treatment in diabetes mellitus is to lower the blood glucose level, which will provide relief from symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia and reduce the risks of microvascular complications. Metformin acts by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and improves peripheral glucose uptake while suppressing appetite and promoting weight reduction. It should be considered as the first-line oral treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, especially when they are overweight. Sulphonylureas such as gliclazide and glipizide act by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. They are considered in patients who do not tolerate metformin, or in those in whom it is contraindicated. Metformin and sulphonylurea could be considered as a combined therapy as they act synergistically. Thiazolidinediones work by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, which regulates the expression of several genes involving metabolism, and work by enhancing the actions of endogenous insulin. They are used as a third-line therapy in combination with metformin and sulphonylurea, however they cause sodium and fluid retention and should not be used in patients with cardiac failure, such as in this case.",

First, alendronate should be avoided in disorders that delay oesophageal emptying (e.g. strictures) and used cautiously in patients with dysphagia or reflux. Secondly, it should be taken upright so that gravity reduces transit time and reflux. Thirdly, by taking at least half an hour before any food, the chances of any alendronate refluxing into the oesophagus are reduced further. Fourthly, taking with lots of water should wash the alendronate through the oesophagus as swiftly as possible.

    "question": "A 59-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department following a fall. He complains of increased tiredness and jerking movement of his legs, which led to his fall from the staircase. He is a smoker. On arrival, he has an oxygen saturation level of 76% in air, and an arterial blood gas reading demonstrates: pH 7.40, PaO2 6 kPa, PaCO2 9.3 kPa, HCO3− 35 mmol/L on room air. His respiratory rate was 20/min. What does this blood gas result show?",

A PaCO2 >6.0 kPa with a low pO2 indicates type II respiratory failure, which would lead to respiratory acidosis. The pH can be expected to be acidotic, however in this case the pH is within the normal range and there is a high compensated bicarbonate level, which suggests chronicity, and compensated type 2 respiratory failure.",

    "question": "A 55-year old man fractures his ankle attempting to replicate the latest dance fad he has seen his children do. He is otherwise fit and well and is haemodynamically stable. The fracture requires open reduction and internal fixation. The trauma registrar has said that he needs to be nil-by-mouth from midnight, however the operating list is always changing and new emergencies may come in. There are at least three cases that are likely to get done before him. Your request that he have breakfast as he is likely to be done later in the day is met with derision. He will need physiological fluid replacement when he is nil-by-mouth. He weighs 70 kg. Which of the following regimens is closest to physiological needs?",

    "page": 131,
    "topic": "Fluid therapy",
    "explanation": "A man weighing 70 kg (average weight) requires 2.5–3 L of water a day, so all options are valid in volumatic terms. In terms of electrolytes, 140 mmol of sodium and 60–70 mmol of potassium are needed. A quantity of 1 L of normal saline contains 154 mmol of sodium. Hartmann’s contains 131 mmol of sodium and 5 mmol of potassium, as well as chloride, calcium and lactate. As can be seen, 3 L of Hartmann’s will give too much sodium and not enough potassium, which could lead to fluid retention and hypokalaemia, respectively. Therefore do not get caught by the “Hartmann’s is more physiological” trap. Hartmann’s may be more appropriate where there has been fluid and electrolyte loss (for instance, diarrhoea and vomiting). A quantity of 1 L of normal saline over the day will meet the patient’s sodium needs, so it is between option A and B. Option A provides 20 mmol of potassium, and option B provides 60 mmol of potassium, therefore option B is the right answer.",

Haemolytic anaemia occurs when there is a shortening of the red cell lifespan, and biochemically this will present as an increase in the products of red cell destruction, as well as increased bone marrow cell production. There are many causes of haemolytic anaemia, either due to a cause within the red cell itself or within the vessel. Problems within the red cell can be with the membrane or with the production, such as sickle cell disease. Extrinsic causes can be divided into immune or non-immune causes. Haptoglobin binds free haemoglobin, therefore levels decrease where there is increased red cell breakdown.",

    "explanation": "The other four diseases actually cause genuine extrapyramidal symptoms and signs, however, essential/familial tremor is far more common. As tremor is the most widely known and usually the earliest sign of Parkinson’s disease, and essential/familial tremor can present in late middle age, frequent misdiagnosis is understandable. Essential and familial tremor are similar, except essential tremor has no family history. These tremors are absent at rest but appear on action, have a frequency of 6–12 Hz and a fine amplitude, are present throughout the range of movement, and may be ameliorated by alcohol or beta-blockers. No other parkinsonian symptoms are present. The parkinsonian tremor is present at rest but diminishes with action, has a frequency of 3–7 Hz and a coarse amplitude, and commonly affects the distal limbs asymmetrically. Importantly, essential/familial tremor is separate from cerebellar tremor, which increases in magnitude throughout the movement to be maximal on approaching target, is usually 4–6 Hz, and is associated with other cerebellar signs.",

    "page": 132,
    "topic": "Biological therapies",
    "explanation": "The relatively older biological DMARDs, which are less expensive (but still more expensive than traditional DMARDs) and have more long-term data and experience of use, target and block TNF-alpha, a key inflammatory cytokine. Etanercept is a humanised TNF-alpha receptor fused with IgG1, whereas adalimumab and infliximab are monoclonal antibodies to TNF-alpha. They can indeed reactivate latent tuberculosis and so a chest X-ray should always be taken before starting therapy to rule this out. Etanercept and adalimumab are given by subcutaneous injection (patients are taught to self-inject) and injection site reactions are a relatively common side effect. They work well alone but data suggests that they work better when used in combination with methotrexate. Other than the synergistic effect of using two DMARDs with different modes of action, it is thought that methotrexate may reduce formation of antibodies against the biological DMARDs themselves. Finally, switching between anti-TNF-alpha agents often can regain control of disease.",

    "explanation": "Whilst falls and urinary incontinence can occur in Alzheimer’s disease, these occur late in disease progression and do not fit with the patient’s young age or mild cognitive impairment. Lewy body dementia has hallucinations as a prominent feature (which are not mentioned) and commonly coexists with parkinsonian movement symptoms. This woman seems to have pyramidal signs in the legs and no arm symptoms. Vascular dementia occurs with multiple strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), which this woman does not have a history of, or risk factors for. Benign intracranial hypertension does not commonly cause dementia, and was mainly included to confuse, with its mention of intracranial pressure. NPH commonly presents with the triad of dementia, gait disturbance and urinary incontinence. In NPH, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow has been impeded but compensatory mechanisms have prevented raised pressure. The lateral ventricles are prominently dilated, and these ventricles exert local pressure on certain brain areas to give the classical clinical picture. Pressure on the frontal lobes gives the dementia and pressure on the medial side of the motor cortex, and the pyramidal tract fibres, cause incontinence and pyramidal leg weakness.",

    "explanation": "Immediate transfusion reactions can be severe and potentially fatal. There are several possibilities for acute fevers during a transfusion. Rarely this may indicate an acute transfusion reaction, potentially due to ABO compatibility most commonly due to an error in administering the correct blood to the correct patient. This reaction will occur within the first few minutes of a transfusion and be characterised by shortness of breath, pain, and a fever. Very rarely a fever may be due to infection present in the blood product itself. A fever, especially following previous history of blood transfusion, may be due to a non-haemolytic transfusion reaction resulting from antibodies to the white blood cells. In the acute setting initial management is vital to protect the patient. Initially this involves stopping the blood transfusion and providing supportive therapy to the patient, in terms of oxygen, hydration and ventilatory support as necessary. Senior help should be sought immediately, and the laboratory contacted to trace the blood to patient stocks.",

    "topic": "Diagnosis of neurological dysfunction",
    "explanation": "In syringomyelia, the central canal of the spinal cord distends and begins to damage neurons by pressure effect. The syrinx (the swelling itself) starts in the cervical cord and can spread both superiorly and inferiorly. The first neurons to be damaged are the pain and temperature neurons bilaterally as their small axons cross the midline near the canal. As this only happens at the level of the syrinx and not above or below, and light touch and proprioception are spared, this causes the classic pattern of cape-like dissociated sensory loss. The anterior horn cell neurons (i.e. lower motor neurons) can also become damaged, giving a lower motor neuron picture at the level of the syrinx (wasting, absent reflexes), then long tract signs may develop later as the syrinx grows (upper motor neuron signs in the legs). Syringomyelia is usually associated with either a history of trauma to the spine, or the Chiari malformation, in which the cerebellar tonsils (at the very least) lie below the level of the foramen magnum. In this patient, she may well have the malformation, which may also explain the occipital headaches.",

Statin therapy has been shown to be beneficial even without high cholesterol prior to treatment. Warfarin is not indicated here as there is no atrial fibrillation, it is her first stroke and there is nothing sinister in the past medical history suggesting a drastic predisposition to thrombus formation. ACE-inhibitor therapy has a beneficial effect even if the blood pressure was previously normal. The European Carotid Surgery Trial showed that carotid stenosis above 70% should be operated on by endarterectomy to deliver maximal benefit in prevention of further transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes, outweighing the risks of surgery.",

Hypogonadism presents with secondary amenorrhoea and anovulation with infertility in women, and decreased libido and lethargy in men. There are many causes of hyperprolactinaemia, and one of them is drug induced. Dopamine antagonist (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics) are known to increase prolactin concentrations. Breast examination should be performed to exclude breast malignancy. Primary hypothyroidism causes TRH-induced prolactin excess and thus a thyroid function test should be performed. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland should be carried out only if serum prolactin is persistently high (1000 mU/L) to detect a prolactin-secreting pituitary tumour (prolactinoma).",

Features of acromegaly include swelling of the hands and feet, lower jaw protrusion, macroglossia (large tongue), bitemporal hemianopia, carpal tunnel syndrome, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and cardiomegaly. In health, high plasma glucose levels feed back to suppress growth hormone secretion. In acromegaly, there is autonomous secretion of growth hormone (GH), usually from a pituitary adenoma that escapes the control of negative feedback. The definitive test for diagnosis is GH levels during an oral glucose tolerance test. Blood samples for GH are taken at a fixed interval after ingestion of the glucose. GH is inhibited by a rise in glucose and thus GH should be undetectable. In acromegaly, however, GH secretion is not suppressed and the level remains high. The failure to suppress growth hormone levels to below 1 μg/L 2 hours after a 75 g oral glucose bolus is considered a positive result.",

They rehydrate the skin, reinstitute the surface lipid layer, and should be taken seriously as part of the management of dry or scaling conditions, without which other topical or systemic treatments would be less effective. Patient preference is a big factor and there is a wide range on the market, therefore patients should be offered many to find which ones suit them. Contact dermatitis, eczema and psoriasis would all generally benefit from use of emollients, by virtue of featuring dryness as part of the rashes. Emollients can also be applied to wounds during the healing process and this is encouraged by some surgeons. Acne vulgaris, however, is related to increased sebum production, which can block pores of sebaceous glands and become infected and inflamed. Therefore, emollients are only likely to make matters worse.",

    "explanation": "Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which can be nephrotoxic by interfering with renal blood supply at the efferent arteriole, an effect magnified in hypovolaemia. Digoxin is excreted by the kidney and thus can have increased toxicity in renal impairment – the dose may need to be lowered. Furosemide is a potent diuretic and is likely to increase hypovolaemia and therefore should be stopped in this instance. Metformin can induce a metabolic acidosis and so should be stopped if the creatinine level is above 150. Amlodipine is a calcium-channel blocker, a relatively safe family of antihypertensives that does not need to be altered in renal failure, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics should all be used carefully in acute renal failure. If the patient becomes hypotensive, however, then it should be considered whether to stop the amlodipine for that reason.",

It is commonest in young people aged 20–30, and presents as an intense pain on defecation that may last for up to 1 hour afterwards. The pain is caused by a tear in the mucosa and muscle spasm during the passage of stools. Treatment is initially with stool softeners to attempt to allow the mucosa to heal naturally.

Reliable pharmacological therapies that are not overcome by the ongoing renal failure exist for hypertension, whereas they do not for severe acidosis, persistent hyperkalaemia, refractory pulmonary oedema or uraemic pericarditis. Vasodilation and decreasing vascular resistance does not become impossible in renal failure. Acidosis can be temporarily ameliorated by use of sodium bicarbonate but it is unclear whether this helps in the long run, especially if the renal failure does not reverse. Severe hyperkalaemia can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Refractory pulmonary oedema requires fluid removal via dialysis.

    "topic": "Urinary frequency",
    "explanation": "Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted from the posterior pituitary gland in response to a high plasma osmolality, hypovolaemia or stress. Its main function is to stimulate the reabsorption of water from the collecting ducts of the nephron into the circulation. This results in a reduction in plasma osmolality and urine output and an increase in urine osmolality and blood pressure. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition caused by either an absolute lack of ADH secretion (cranial DI) or renal insensitivity to its actions (nephrogenic DI). DI usually presents with massive polyuria as water cannot be reabsorbed from the collecting ducts. DI is suggested by a plasma osmolality of >300 mOsm/kg with a urine osmolality <600 mOsm/kg. Diabetes insipidus is usually diagnosed using the water deprivation test. A positive result is recorded when water deprivation fails to increase the concentration of urine due to a lack of ADH or insensitivity to its actions. If the initial test is positive the patient is given a dose of desmopressin – a synthetic ADH analogue. If the patient concentrates their urine in response to desmopressin the defect must be central and a diagnosis of cranial diabetes insipidus can be made. If, however, the urine is not concentrated following desmopressin administration there is end-organ resistance to ADH, i.e. nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",

On microscopic pathological examination of the brain, both extracellular beta-amyloid plaques and tau-protein-based neurofibrillary tangles are seen. Degeneration of the basal forebrain nuclei also occurs in Alzheimer’s disease, and cholinesterase inhibitors increase functional acetylcholine at synapses, thus temporarily improving memory dysfunction, especially in early disease.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man taking warfarin for a metallic aortic valve presents with 5 days of cough productive of purulent sputum, fever, anorexia and confusion. He is diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and is admitted for antibiotic therapy.\nWhich of the following antibiotics does NOT interact with warfarin?",

      "A. Ciprofloxacin",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 164,
    "topic": "Antibiotics with warfarin",
    "explanation": "Quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, macrolides such as clarithromycin, and the antibiotic metronidazole (used against anaerobic organisms) are all inhibitors of the cytochrome p450 metabolism system in the liver, and thus inhibit hepatic metabolism of the warfarin, leading to increased anticoagulant action and an increase in the international normalised ratio (INR). Rifampicin is a cytochrome p450 inducer, and so will enhance metabolism of warfarin and decrease the anticoagulant action. Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin are not known to affect the cytochrome p450 system. Not included as a potential answer here are any broad-spectrum penicillins such as amoxicillin. These do not affect the cytochrome p450 system, however, patients’ INRs have been observed to rise when taking amoxicillin, and this is believed to be due to the effect on the gut flora. Many floral bacteria may break down warfarin before absorption, so the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may lead to an effectively increased dose reaching the bloodstream.",

    "answer": "C",

    "topic": "Management of hyperglycaemia (3)",
    "explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that is characterised by the triad of cardinal biochemical features: hyperglycaemia, hyperketonaemia, and metabolic acidosis. A significant proportion of newly diagnosed type I diabetic patients present with ketoacidosis. The hyperglycaemia causes dehydration and electrolyte loss, especially sodium and potassium through osmotic diuresis. Ketosis is caused by insulin deficiency, and it is exacerbated by elevated catecholamines and other stress hormones, resulting in unrestrained lipolysis to free fatty acids for ketogenesis in the liver. The resulting metabolic acidosis causes the exchange of hydrogen ions for intracellular potassium ions although there is also potassium loss through the kidney and intestine. Rehydration with intravenous fluids is essential but should be done with caution especially in the elderly. Insulin infusion is normally started at a rate of 6 U/hour in the first hour. The blood glucose level is monitored frequently for adequate adjustment of insulin therapy. A urinary catheter is considered in patients with oliguria for fluid balance monitoring. Potassium replacement is not needed in the first litre of intravenous fluid unless <3.0 mmol/L. Given K+ is 4.5 mmol/L, adding 40mmol/L immediately risks hyperkalemia.",

Poor management of diabetes and immoderate alcohol consumption cause hypertension and hence are secondary causes of atherosclerosis. The evidence that salt intake is as significant a cause of hypertension is not as conclusive. A doctor who engages with a patient rather than offering advice based on assumptions about them is more likely to achieve adherence. Therefore, the most comprehensive approach involves assessing multiple modifiable risk factors including smoking, lipids, blood pressure, glucose control, and exercise levels (pre-morbid mobility).",

Hypothyroidism usually results from an intrinsic disorder of the thyroid gland, in which thyroid function test shows a low serum T4 and elevated TSH level. In this case, however, the low serum T4 and low TSH level suggest central hypothyroidism (secondary hypothyroidism), which warrants magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to visualise a pituitary adenoma (which may explain the patient’s bitemporal hemianopia). Thyroid antibodies (C, D) would be relevant for primary hypothyroidism. Scintigraphy (A) and ultrasound (E) assess the thyroid gland itself, which is not the suspected source of the problem here.",

Diagnosis is supported by Schirmer’s test (<10mm or <5mm depending on criteria) and positive anti-Ro/La antibodies. This patient has isolated keratoconjunctivitis sicca, likely primary Sjögren’s syndrome given the autoantibodies (or secondary to her thyroid disease). As her only symptom is dry eyes, treatment is symptomatic. Treatment is with artificial tears and artificial saliva (if mouth dry), as these help symptoms and carry little side effects. Hydroxychloroquine can improve arthralgia and fatigue. Steroids can be used in persistent salivary gland swelling or neuropathy. Tear duct surgery is rarely indicated.",

    "explanation": "Hypoglycaemia is defined as blood glucose <3.5 mmol/L (or <4.0 mmol/L). It commonly occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus using insulin or sulphonylureas. Alcohol can also potentiate hypoglycaemia. Common symptoms include sweating, anxiety, tremor, or in severe hypoglycaemia speech difficulty, confusion and reduced consciousness. Checking blood glucose is crucial (E). Oral glucose drinks can be given if conscious, while intravenous dextrose is given to those who have impaired consciousness (C). In patients on long-acting sulphonylureas, there is a possibility of recurrent hypoglycaemia and they should be given intravenous dextrose titrated to blood glucose to prevent recurrence (B). Given the history of alcoholism and reduced consciousness, a CT head should be considered to rule out head injury (A). Intramuscular glucagon may not work effectively in alcohol-related hypoglycaemia, liver disease or prolonged hypoglycaemia as it relies on hepatic glycogen stores which may be depleted (D).",

    "explanation": "The risk of recurrence and metastasis of malignant melanoma is most strongly correlated with the depth of invasion of the primary tumour into the skin layers, measured histologically as the Breslow thickness (invasive depth). Depth <0.76 mm = low risk, 0.76–1.5 mm = medium risk, >1.5 mm = high risk. Other factors like ulceration, mitotic rate, and lymph node involvement also affect prognosis, but Breslow thickness is the single most important prognostic factor for localized melanoma.",

    "explanation": "Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia often associated with a long QT interval. While it can self-terminate (as it appears to have done here), it can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Identifying and removing the underlying cause is crucial. Common causes include electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia) and drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., certain anti-arrhythmics, antipsychotics, antibiotics). Therefore, the immediate next step is to check the drug chart for potential culprits and also check recent electrolyte levels. While monitoring (A) is important and a crash call (E) might be needed if it recurs or causes haemodynamic compromise, identifying the cause (B) is paramount. Anti-arrhythmics (D) might be needed but some can worsen long QT. Fluid balance (C) is less relevant unless related to electrolyte disturbance.",

Sepsis is SIRS + suspected/confirmed infection (here, likely UTI/pyelonephritis with positive blood culture). Septicaemia means bacteria in the blood. Severe sepsis is sepsis + signs of organ dysfunction/hypoperfusion (e.g., oliguria <0.5ml/kg/hr for >2hrs, altered mental status, lactate >2). This patient has sepsis with oliguria (30ml in 3hrs = 10ml/hr) and confusion, indicating organ dysfunction. Septic shock is sepsis with persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Her BP is currently stable (120/80), so severe sepsis is the best description.",

    "answer": "D",

    "topic": "Myasthenia gravis",
    "explanation": "In the tensilon test, edrophonium (a very short acting cholinesterase inhibitor) is administered and if positive, the weakness markedly improves for around 2–4 minutes. Positivity suggests myasthenia gravis although it can be positive in the Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Electromyography commonly reveals that with repeated stimulation of the motor nerve fibres, the amplitude of the muscle action potentials reduce – a “decrementing response”. This seems to represent the classic fatigability of the weakness in myasthenia gravis. A more sensitive test is looking at “jitter” – the variability of action potential time interval between two different single motor fibres of the same motor unit. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are found in at least 90% of patients and, with increased sensitivity of new assays, it is thought that 96% actually may be positive. In many negative patients, antibodies to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) are found. In any new patient, a CT of the chest should be carried out to look for thymoma, found in 10% of patients. Hyperplasia is found in a further 70% of patients. Rimmed vacuoles are in fact a hallmark of the rare inclusion body myositis. Muscle biopsy may reveal muscle fibre atrophy and can show small necrotic foci of damage or diffuse necrosis and inflammation, depending on disease severity.",

    "explanation": "A potassium level >7 mmol/L is a medical emergency and can be asymptomatic until arrest. ECG monitoring should be set up to look for early changes, and the ECG compared to a previous ECG from when the patient was stable (if available). The T-waves tent because potassium influx into cells drives repolarisation, and ventricular repolarisation is represented by the T-wave – the higher extracellular potassium concentrations lead to a larger magnitude of depolarisation. The P-waves flatten (although this may be subtle) and the QRS complexes broaden. Finding of any of these changes should increase urgency of treatment, during which ECG monitoring should continue. The changes progress to reveal a “sine wave” pattern, and ventricular fibrillation can ensue if appropriate treatment is not instituted. Deepening Q-waves would be associated with evolution of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, with the initial ST elevation decreasing and the Q-waves deepening hours to days after the infarct.",

    "explanation": "A full blood count can reveal anaemia (which may be due to iron deficiency), polycythaemia, lymphoma or leukaemia, all of which can cause pruritus. Polycythaemia characteristically causes itching upon bathing. Iron studies can reveal a low ferritin and thus iron deficiency, which can cause pruritus. A cause should be sought (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia, diet). Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can both cause itching. Chronic renal failure can cause an intractable pruritus, which unfortunately is often not relieved by dialysis, thus measuring urea is useful. Electrolyte abnormalities do not cause pruritus. A full and thorough history and examination can guide towards a potential diagnosis, however subclinical disease may be evident on blood tests, hence the pruritus screen. Other indicated blood tests include liver function tests (bile salt deposited in the skin can cause itching). If all is negative, psychological factors can often play a part, with anxiety being the most common cause. The tests can be repeated at intervals if patients re-present and/or psychological factors seem unlikely.",

Therefore, complex partial seizures present with episodes of clouding of consciousness combined with various symptoms that may include visceral symptoms (fullness, choking, nausea, tachycardia, taste and smell hallucinations), memory disturbance (déjà-vu, jamais-vu, derealisation, flashbacks, formed auditory or visual hallucinations), motor disturbances of a semi-purposeful nature, or intense paroxysmal mood disturbance. Shooting pains into the limbs, depending on the distribution, sounds typical of a radiculopathy, and “electric-shock” sensations sounds like “Lhermitte’s sign”, a sign in multiple sclerosis with cervical posterior column involvement, whereby sudden neck flexion causes electric-shock sensations in the limbs. Focal somatosensory or pain information is not processed in the temporal lobe or limbic system anyhow, so is unlikely to be caused by complex partial seizures.",

Mohs micrographic surgery, whereby excised samples are examined under the microscope at the time of excision, and then further tissue resected until the margins are clear, can be used for high-risk recurrent lesions. Radiotherapy can be used where excision is not possible, and chemotherapy can be used in metastatic disease. Sun exposure is indeed a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma, which tends to be ill-defined keratotic ulcerating lesions. They are more common in kidney transplant patients because of the long-term immunosuppression – another risk factor. Unlike basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas can indeed metastasise, usually to lymph nodes, so if histopathology confirms a squamous cell carcinoma, annual follow-up for 5 years to exclude lymphadenopathy or recurrent malignancy is recommended.",

Isoniazid, pyrazinamide and rifampicin along with the ethambutol comprise standard quadruple therapy, which will be given for the first 2 months in new tuberculosis, before continuing the isoniazid and rifampicin for a further 4 months. All three can cause hepatitis. Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy via a vitamin B6 deficiency, so prophylactic pyridoxine is prescribed.

    "explanation": "Amiodarone has a chemical structure that is analogous to thyroxine and contains large amounts of iodine. Amiodarone has a cytotoxic effect on thyroid follicular cells and inhibits conversion of T4 to T3. As a result, either hypothyroidism (Wolff–Chaikoff effect) or hyperthyroidism (Jod–Basedow effect) may occur. Thyroid function tests should be done before commencement of amiodarone and thyroid-stimulating hormone should be measured every 6 months whilst the patient is on treatment.",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 207,
    "topic": "Painful fingers",
    "explanation": "Systemic sclerosis is a connective tissue disorder characterised by thickening and fibrosis of the skin (scleroderma) with involvement of internal organs. There are two forms: 1) a limited cutaneous type (60%) and 2) a diffuse cutaneous type (40%). Limited cutaneous scleroderma is limited to the distal limbs (i.e. distal to the elbows and knees). Other features include a beaked nose and small, furrowed mouth (microstoma). Limited cutaneous scleroderma also encompasses CREST syndrome, which is characterised by Calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, oEsophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasia. Calcinosis is the formation of calcium deposits in the soft tissues, often seen on the pulps of the fingers. Raynaud phenomenon is an idiopathic condition with episodic digital vasospasm precipitated by a cold environment, as a result of which the affected fingers or toes become white and may be painful. Oesophageal dysmotility is manifest as dysphagia and reflux. Sclerodactyly describes the presence of tight, shiny skin over the fingers, producing a fixed flexion deformity. In limited cutaneous scleroderma the anti-centromere antibody is characteristically positive. Pulmonary hypertension is a common internal manifestation.\nDiffuse cutaneous scleroderma can involve the whole skin of the body. Patients are characteristically positive for the anti-SCL-70 antibody (also known as anti-topoisomerase II). In this form of disease, patients are particularly at risk of a ‘renal crisis’ – a life-threatening malignant hypertension with rapid renal impairment. By contrast, pulmonary hypertension is less common. Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis has a worse prognosis than limited cutaneous disease. The treatment of systemic sclerosis is with steroids and immunosuppressives. Penicillamine slows skin disease (steroids do not help the skin). Lung fibrosis is the main cause of death, followed by renal disease.\nScleroderma can occur without internal organ disease (localised scleroderma). If this occurs in plaques it is known as morphea; if it occurs in lines it is termed en coup de sabre. “Scleroderma sine scleroderma” is the name given for patients who have typical vascular or internal organ features of systemic sclerosis but without the cutaneous sclerosis.\nDermatomyositis, another connective tissue disease, can feature dilated nail-fold capillary loops, but this presentation is not of dermatomyositis – we would expect a proximal muscle weakness and pain with possible skin manifestations including heliotropic rash around the eyes and Gottron’s papules on the dorsum of the hands.",

    "topic": "Antibody testing",
    "explanation": "This patient has Goodpasture’s syndrome, which is a rare condition in which autoantibodies are formed against the glomerular basement membrane and the alveolar membrane. The antibodies trigger a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction that causes renal failure, pulmonary haemorrhage and haemoptysis. The condition is usually diagnosed by the detection of anti-GBM in the serum and via renal biopsy. The biopsy often shows focal or diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence may demonstrate linear deposition of IgG antibodies and complement (C3) on the glomerular basement membrane. Goodpasture’s syndrome is usually treated aggressively with plasmapheresis, corticosteroids and immunosuppression.\nAnti-dsDNA antibodies are found in systemic lupus erythematosis, and whilst only 60% are sensitive (compared to >95% with ANA), it is far more specific. Lupus can cause renal disease, typically with proteinuria and/or casts rather than haematuria, and can affect the lungs through pleuritis or pleural effusions but it does not cause haemoptysis. Anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are specific for mixed connective tissue disease, which would be unlikely to give the present clinical picture. Cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (cANCA) are most associated with Wegener’s granulomatosis, which could cause a similar picture with renal impairment of a nephritic type and haemoptysis. It is also sometimes found in Churg–Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and polyarteritis nodosa. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) are found most often in microscopic polyangiitis, and can actually sometimes be positive in Goodpasture’s syndrome.",

The most common malignant cause is lung cancer, followed by lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic colon cancer. Patients present with dyspnoea, cough, facial plethora and oedema, oedema of the upper extremities, distended neck veins and chest veins and, in severe cases, they have stridor related to laryngeal oedema or direct compression. Oxygen should be provided to correct hypoxaemia. A chest X-ray might reveal a widened mediastinum and a mass lesion. Airway management is important as the patient might have upper airway obstruction due to severe oedema and intubation should be considered in these cases. Corticosteroids and radiation therapy or percutaneous stenting are considered for the relief of obstructive symptoms.

Initial investigations need to include liver function tests (LFTs), paracetamol and salicylate levels, blood glucose (as such patients are prone to hypoglycaemia), urea and electrolytes (think hepatorenal syndrome, although urea is synthesised in the liver and so may not be deranged), clotting and an arterial blood gas looking for lactic acidosis. If patients with a paracetamol overdose present within 1 hour you can consider giving activated charcoal to prevent absorption.

For diagnosis, a burrow (not those on the genitalia) should be scraped off and examined under the microscope directly. A dermatoscope can sometimes visualise the mite in situ in the burrow on the patient. Malathion and permethrin are both valid topical treatments, which should be applied all over.

However, serology confirming prior infection with one of these organisms does not confirm GBS. Lumbar puncture commonly reveals raised protein, but lymphocytes are not usually raised and oligoclonal bands would not be expected. The underlying pathology is an autoimmune attack on the myelin in the peripheral nerves, and so slowed motor conduction speed would be expected. If the inflammation is severe then axons can be damaged, giving a conduction block picture. This indicates that a degree of irreversible damage has taken place.

    "topic": "Hepatitis serology",
    "explanation": "The immunological tests for hepatitis B can be complicated and confusing, however they can be very helpful in determining the current hepatitis status of the patient as well as their previous exposure. Hepatitis B is a DNA virus that is mainly transmitted via blood products and sexual activity. Certain individuals, such as those who work in healthcare, are required to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. The vaccine contains the hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg) against which the immune system produces hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). It is HBsAb that is measured after vaccination to evaluate the response to the vaccine. Some individuals have a poor response to the vaccine and require higher doses of vaccine or booster shots. HBsAb are also found in patients who have had hepatitis in the past. In this situation the patient will also have developed antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), which is not present in patients who have been immunised.\nHepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) can usually be detected within 4 weeks of infection and is the earliest marker of hepatitis B infection. It is not found in patients vaccinated against hepatitis B. If HBsAg is still detected in the serum 6 months after an acute hepatitis B infection, the patient has become a chronic carrier of the virus. The risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection is related to age at the time of infection. The majority of infected neonates develop chronic infection whereas only 5–10% of adults do so.\nHepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be present in both acute and chronic hepatitis B and indicates a high level of infectivity. The presence of HBeAg in chronic hepatitis B suggests that the patient is infective and has an aggressive disease requiring treatment. In addition to establishing infectivity, the measurement of HBeAg can be used to assess the efficacy of treatment with falling levels indicating success. It should be noted that there are some mutant strains of the hepatitis B virus found in Asia and the Middle East that do not produce HBeAg. Hepatitis B DNA levels can also be used to assess disease activity with high levels indicating active disease and infectivity.\nHepatitis B core antibodies (HBcAb) can be present in acute and chronic infection. They are formed against the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), which is found within the liver and therefore cannot be detected using serology. In acute infection it is the second marker to be detected, after HBsAb, and is usually seen after 4 weeks of infection. In chronic disease the presence of high titres of HBcAb, in the absence of HBeAg, indicates low infectivity and disease activity. This serological picture is associated with a better prognosis with fewer individuals progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "topic": "Lumbar puncture",
    "explanation": "The glucose is low, indicating excessive glucose consumption, which rules out viral meningitis. The predominance of lymphocytes suggests a more chronic infection and rules out bacterial meningitis. The negative India ink stain rules out cryptococcal meningitis. Finally, the extremely large number of lymphocytes and amount of protein make tuberculosis more likely than malignant meningitis. Ziehl–Neelsen staining or PCR would confirm the diagnosis. However, clinical information, conspicuously absent from this case, would be extremely useful.",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 211,
    "topic": "Management of hyperkalaemia",
    "explanation": "Hyperkalaemia is defined as a serum potassium level of >5 mmol/L, but severe hyperkalaemia, with a serum potassium level of >7 mmol/L, is a medical emergency. ECG monitoring should be instituted and intravenous access sought. Calcium gluconate does not lower serum potassium, but 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate is given as a cardioprotective agent as it is a cardiac membrane stabiliser and protects against cardiac arrhythmias. This should be given soon as it can buy time to lower the potassium level. Dextrose (50 ml of 50% solution) with 10 U Actrapid insulin can be given intravenously – insulin drives potassium rapidly into cells and the dextrose is given with it to avoid hypoglycaemia. Potassium and glucose levels should then be monitored repeatedly. Calcium resonium, typically given as a 30 mg suppository, soaks up potassium from the bowel wall, and then an enema after 9 hours will actually remove potassium from the body. Calcium resonium can also be given orally (15 mg t.d.s.) with laxatives to speed transit time. The cause for the high potassium should be sought and reversed where possible. Medications such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, and NSAIDs can contribute and should be stopped. Hyperglycaemia can be responsible, as can causes of cell lysis such as burns and rhabdomyolysis. Acute or chronic renal failure are often responsible, and if acute renal failure is not reversible by other means then dialysis will be needed and this often is the definitive means of reducing the serum potassium. Furosemide is a loop diuretic and causes potassium loss through the kidney but if the patient is clinically dry or has renal failure this may be unsafe. Salbutamol nebulisers can be used to drive potassium into cells, but the high doses needed lead to side effects such as tachycardia, anxiety and tremors, which are undesirable in an already unwell patient.",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 211,
    "topic": "Malabsorption",
    "explanation": "Coeliac disease causes a gluten-related enteropathy of the small bowel. When the patient consumes gluten-containing foods, a T-cell mediated autoimmune reaction results in subtotal villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia of the small bowel mucosa. Specifically, it is gliadin – a constituent of gluten – which causes the immunological response. The result is malabsorption leading to malnutrition, anaemia, steatorrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating and fatigue. The initial investigation for coeliac disease is the measurement of serum anti-endomyseal or anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies, which have been shown to have sensitivities and specificities of over 95%. Antibodies to alpha-gliadin and reticulin can also be measured although they have lower sensitivities and specificities. The gold standard diagnostic technique is duodenal or jejunal biopsy taken during endoscopy. Gluten exclusion can reverse the disease process, and therefore biopsy must occur before exclusion starts. Since this is an invasive and unpleasant procedure it is usually performed as a second-line investigation in patients with positive serology. If the biopsy suggests coeliac disease the patient should be placed on a gluten-free diet and re-biopsied at a later date to assess small bowel recovery.",

      "E. A 65-year-old man with insidious-onset mild bilateral sensorineural deafness and no other neurological abnormality"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 212,
    "topic": "Brain tumours",
    "explanation": "The 65-year-old man most likely has presbyacusis – reduced ability to hear high-frequency sounds with ageing. The 40-year-old woman with insidious unilateral deafness experiences sound louder on the affected side with Weber’s testing – this is indicative of conductive rather than sensorineural deafness. There is also no other neurology mentioned. Regarding cerebellopontine angle tumours, the most common is the vestibular schwannoma (formerly known as the misleading “acoustic neuroma”), representing 80% thereof. The café au lait spots of the 30-year-old woman are indicative of neurofibromatosis type 1 (von Recklinghausen disease). This neurocutaneous syndrome is not in fact associated with vestibular schwannomas – whereas neurofibromatosis type 2 is. This syndrome typically presents with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, and rarely are café au lait spots a feature. Furthermore, facial weakness coming on over days with no other neurological deficit is not typical of a cerebellopontine angle lesion. Cranial nerves V, VII and VIII are typically involved in a cerebellopontine angle lesion – although facial weakness can often be absent despite marked compression. The man with bilateral facial weakness, nasal voice and swallowing difficulty appears to have widespread involvement of the lower motor cranial nerves – a bulbar palsy – his age and the speed of onset should raise suspicion of motor neuron disease. That leaves the 50-year-old woman with sensorineural deafness of insidious onset (Weber’s louder contralaterally) and some reduced ipsilateral facial numbness (V nerve involvement). The unilateral sensorineural deafness of slow onset is typical and is due to the slow-growing benign tumour compressing the VIII nerve. Vertigo is uncommon as compensatory mechanisms can act over the long time period. If the tumour grows larger than 2 cm in diameter, the V nerve can be compressed giving pain, numbness and paraesthesia. Cerebellar symptoms may appear with very large tumours, and rarely fourth ventricle compression can give a raised intracranial pressure.",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 212,
    "topic": "Chest injury",
    "explanation": "Beck’s triad of muffled heart sounds, engorged neck veins and hypotension indicate acute cardiac tamponade, in this case caused by a stab wound to the myocardium. The resultant haemorrhage fills the fibrous pericardium, reducing the space available for the heart to fill in systole. Diastolic volume is therefore steadily reduced as the haemorrhage continues, leading to a possibly fatal reduction in cardiac output. Pericardiocentesis is required acutely: a cannula is inserted to the left of the xiphisternum under cardiac monitoring (an electrocardiogram (ECG) change can indicate contact with the myocardium, i.e. that you’ve gone too far). Upon penetrating the pericardium, the blood can be drained and cardiac output restored. Beck also performed the first defribrillation in 1947 with equipment made to his design, by his friend James Rand Jr, who also invented the electric shaver (under the Remington brand).\nKussmaul’s sign is a raised jugular venous pressure (JVP) upon inspiration that falls in expiration and is seen in constrictive pericarditis. This does not happen reliably in acute cardiac tamponade, where neck veins remain distended throughout respiration. Kussmaul also first described the deep, slow and laboured breathing pattern that occurs late in the severe metabolic acidosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and renal failure.\nA Stokes–Adams attack is syncope, with or without seizures, resulting from a transiently reduced cardiac output and can occur in any position and during sleep. Virchow’s triad describes the thrombotic risk factors of hypercoagulability, venous stasis and endothelial injury.",

    "explanation": "Primary hyperaldosteronism is a cause of excess aldosterone secretion, which leads to increased serum sodium concentration irrespective of plasma renin concentration. It is named Conn’s syndrome if this is due to an aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma. This is the cause in <5% of cases; 70% are caused by bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia. The increased plasma sodium causes fluid retention, which leads to hypertension. Aldosterone is secreted by the adrenal glands and stimulates the kidneys to retain sodium (and excrete more potassium). The diuretic spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that will retain potassium and shed sodium and hence cause diuresis. Loop diuretics like furosemide and bumetanide cause a much more profound diuresis by inhibiting sodium/potassium/chloride reabsorption and hence potassium is lost.",

The major risk factors for oesophageal carcinoma include smoking and alcohol intake, as well as the presence of Barrett’s oesophagus in adenocarcinoma. Epstein–Barr virus infection has also been linked to the aetiology of the disease. Oesophageal carcinoma often presents late in the course of the illness and hence holds a relatively poor prognosis.

    "topic": "Diagnosis of neurological dysfunction (4)",
    "explanation": "The lack of cerebellar involvement, optic neuritis, eye movement disorder, lack of sensory involvement and the patient’s age all go against a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). In older patients MS is more likely to be primary progressive so the lack of relapses does not go against it necessarily. The patient seems to have a mixture of upper and lower motor neuron weakness in the limbs, which could go with cervical spondylosis, syringomyelia or motor neurone disease (MND) or MND-like syndromes. However the lack of sensory involvement points to MND or an MND-like syndrome. Syringomyelia starts with the lack of pain sensation in the arms before giving more prominent lower motor neuron weakness in the arms, and then later upper motor neuron weakness in the legs. Cervical spondylosis commonly presents with shooting pains into a dermatomal distribution in the arms, and would give upper motor neuron but not lower motor neuron signs in the legs. Brisk reflexes in a wasted limb is classic for MND, and comes from a combination of upper and lower motor neuron loss with an intact sensory input into the reflex loop. The patient’s age is classic (>50), and progression swift, with patients typically dying 3–5 years from onset. Retroviruses such as HIV and polio (on a more limited scale, both in terms of affected limbs and worldwide disease burden with the introduction of improved sanitation and vaccines) can give lower and upper motor neuron loss with sparing of sensory neurons, and thus HIV can give an MND-like syndrome, however this patient does not have a travel history or medical history to make us consider this.",

    "question": "A 43-year-old woman presents with a history of 5 months of symmetrical hand pain and swelling with morning stiffness. You suspect rheumatoid arthritis.\nWhich of the following tests is the most sensitive and specific for rheumatoid arthritis?",
    "options": [
      "A. ANCA",
      "B. Anti-CCP antibodies",
      "C. Anti-centromere antibodies",
      "D. Rheumatoid factor",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 215,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (2)",
    "explanation": "ANCA is an antibody associated with small vessel vasculitides such as Wegener’s granulomatosis and Churg–Strauss syndrome. Anti-centromere antibodies are associated with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Rheumatoid factor is the traditional screening test for rheumatoid arthritis, however it is only positive in 70–80% of cases and it is present in many other autoimmune diseases, i.e. it lacks specificity. It is also present in 25% of the over-65s who do not have rheumatoid arthritis. Soft tissue swelling may be seen on X-ray of the hands but this is non-specific, and bony erosions are a late change that would not be expected in this case. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody testing is 98% sensitive and far more specific to rheumatoid arthritis, and therefore represents a superior test. However it is important that diagnosis is made using the ACR criteria using clinical findings in addition to antibody tests.",

    "answer": "D",
    "page": 215,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of skin lesions (3)",
    "explanation": "The distribution (cheeks, nose) may be described as “malar” and the areas are all exposed to the sunlight. This makes a rash worsened by sunlight more likely. Whilst it is a typical distribution for the rash of systemic lupus erythematosus, this is a fairly rare condition. It also does not usually present with papules and pustules. Dermatomyositis is an extremely rare condition that can feature a heliotropic or sun-sensitive rash, as well as Gottron’s papules on the hand and linear erythema on the dorsum of the hand, along with an inflammatory myositis. The qualities of the rash described above do not sound like eczema, which is typically dry and itchy and does not feature papules or pustules. Acne vulgaris does feature papules and pustules, usually on the face as well as the upper back and shoulders, but this typically affects those in the throes of puberty. Rosacea affects those in middle age, more typically women, and is more common than systemic lupus erythematosus, and does feature papules and pustules on a background of erythematous skin. The first-line treatment is oral tetracyclines (such as lymecycline).",

    "question": "You are covering the wards overnight. You are bleeped by the critical care ward.

You ask her to fax the ECG to you as you are so busy.\nWhat is meant by second-degree heart block?",

      "A. A bradycardic QRS complex is dissociated from the P-wave",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 215,
    "topic": "Electrocardiogram (6)",
    "explanation": "First-degree heart block is a prolonged P-R interval (>0.2 seconds). The P-wave is suffering a constant delay as it passes via the atrial-ventricular node (AVN). Second-degree heart block comes in two forms: either a P-R delay that increases with time until a beat is missed (Mobitz type 1 or Wenckebach block) or beats are missed in a ratio, i.e. every third beat (Mobitz type 2). Second-degree block is more serious and is best treated with pacing. Complete heart block (third degree) is more serious again. Beats are driven by a pacing focus distal to the AVN (normally at a bradycardic pace) and the P-wave is therefore dissociated from the QRS complexes. These patients are vulnerable to Stokes–Adams attacks and are treated with a pacemaker. ST segment elevation indicates ischaemia and irregularly irregular complexes are a feature of atrial fibrillation.",

The first-line anti-epileptic medication used in seizures is intravenous lorazepam. It is important to have full resuscitation equipment available when administering intravenous benzodiazepines since there is a risk of respiratory arrest. If intravenous access is not possible, alternative options include rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam. If the benzodiazepines fail to stop the seizure, an intravenous infusion of phenytoin should be started. If this fails, an anaesthetist should be called to initiate general anaesthesia.",

    "topic": "Supraventricular tachycardia",
    "explanation": "Supra-ventricular tachycardias are often paroxysmal and can last from seconds to hours. They can be caused by coffee, alcohol and tobacco but are usually the result of atrio-ventricular node (AVN) re-entry tachycardia (dual pathways within the AVN) or Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (an accessory atrio-ventricular pathway outside of the AVN). The narrow-complex tachycardia can exhaust a heart and precipitate failure due to inadequate filling during diastole, leading to reduced cardiac output. The Valsalva manoeuvre and carotid sinus massage can end this arrhythmia, as can cardioverting with adenosine (a very short-acting AV nodal blocking agent). For adenosine to work, it must be administered promptly: intravenous injection over 2 seconds via a large-bore cannula. The patient should continue to receive cardiac monitoring and the ward crash trolley should be close at hand as excessive atrio-ventricular node delay can lead to arrest.",

If the syndrome features inappropriate ADH secretion (siADH), then the urine should be concentrated in the face of dilute plasma. By simple homeostatic principles, if the plasma is dilute, the urine should become more dilute in an attempt to concentrate the plasma. Option A, dilute urine with dilute plasma, could represent fluid overload. Option B, dilute urine with normal plasma concentration, could represent any cause of diuresis, which could become option C if the patient does not receive enough fluid intake!

She also complains of fatigue, malaise, hair loss and arthralgia that has lasted for 3 months. On examination, she has a rash over her cheeks, and auscultation of the chest reveals a friction rub and dullness to percussion over the right lower zone.

    "explanation": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic multisystem connective tissue disease of unknown cause. Almost 90% of affected individuals are women with a peak onset in the second and third decades. The patients present with myriad symptoms that could affect virtually every organ in the body. Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss are present during the course of the disease, occurring in 50–100% of patients. Pleurisy, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and alveolar haemorrhage can all occur in SLE. In this case the presence of a friction rub and pleural effusion suggests the diagnosis of pleuritis. The pleural effusion in SLE is a mild exudate characterised by an elevation in pleural fluid low-dose heparin (LDH) but without signs of marked inflammation. Patients normally respond to therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and moderate- to high-dose steroids are used if there is no response to NSAIDS within a few days.",

    "page": 217,
    "topic": "Urinary frequency (2)",
    "explanation": "Hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma (HONK) is a condition characterised by severe hyperglycaemia (>30–50 mmol/L) without significant hyperketonaemia or acidosis. It usually affects older patients, of which many have undiagnosed diabetes, or with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In HONK the circulating insulin is sufficient to prevent ketogenesis but insufficient to allow the peripheral uptake and metabolism of glucose. As such the patient does not become acidotic. The hyperglycaemia causes an osmotic diuresis that rapidly dehydrates the patient and produces an extremely high plasma osmolality. There is hyperosmolality (>320 mOsm/kg) with severe dehydration, and pre-renal uraemia is common. The conscious level is depressed when plasma osmolarity is high, and the result is coma. These patients are usually sensitive to insulin and approximately 3 U/hour of insulin should be given initially. Excessive rates of fall of blood glucose (>5 mmol/hour) may be associated with cerebral oedema. Isotonic saline is given unless serum sodium exceeds 155 mmol/L, in which case 0.45% saline should be used. These patients have a high risk of deep vein thrombosis and thus prophylactic subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin is recommended. The mortality rate of HONK approaches 30%, which is likely to be a reflection of the advanced age of many of the patients and the presence of underlying illness.",

      "E. Reconsider the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 218,
    "topic": "Wilson’s disease",
    "explanation": "Wilson’s disease is an autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism. In health, copper is transported in the serum bound to caeruloplasmin and is excreted in the bile. In Wilson’s disease there is a defect in copper metabolism so it is not excreted in the bile and instead accumulates in the tissues. This process suppresses the synthesis of caeruloplasmin, which allows unbound (free) copper to enter the circulation. The high levels of free serum copper accumulate in vital organs such as the liver (cirrhosis), eye (Kayser–Fleischer rings), kidney and basal ganglia of the brain (personality changes). If left untreated the patient is at risk of developing cirrhosis, renal tubular disease, neurological disease and neuropsychiatric complications. Patients with Wilson’s disease have an elevated serum free copper, urinary copper and hepatic copper (via biopsy). Paradoxically, total serum copper is usually low.\nPenicillamine is used in the treatment of Wilson’s disease as it chelates copper and other minerals and hence can prevent the deposition of copper into organs such as the liver and the central nervous system. Its use can reduce and help reverse pre-cirrhotic liver disease although neurological damage is often less reversible. It binds to circulating copper and facilitates its excretion in the urine. There are serious side effects of penicillamine, and patients should be advised to report any sore throat, temperatures or bruising. These signs may indicate agranulocytosis and immunosuppression that needs to be identified early, the drug stopped, and necessary action taken. Therefore, advising the patient to come in for an urgent blood test to look at the differential white cell count and the platelets would be the safest course of action. These severe reactions are dose-related but can occur early in the start of treatment, therefore regular blood testing is advisable following the commencement of penicillamine.",
