        "question": "A 43-year-old mildly overweight female complains of periodic right knee swelling and pain with physical\nactivity for the past three manths. She says that this problem started while on a hiking trip three months ago,\nat which point she experienced a ‘popping’ sensatian in her right knee. She recalls that her knee was swallen\nthe next day, and responded to over-the-counter pain killers. Recently, she has been having to limit her\nphysical activities due ta knee pain. On physical examination, there is tenderness of the anterior and medial\nright knee joint. Which of the following is the most likely diagnasis?",
        "options": [
            "A. Anterior cruciate ligament tear",
            "B. Meniscal tear",
            "C. Osteoarthritis",
            "D. Patellar tendanitis",

            "F. Stress fracture"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Injury to a number of different structures within the knee, including ligaments and cartilaginous menisci, can\ncause a popping ar snapping sensation. Damage to the medial meniscus is a comman knee injury that\npresents as described above. Meniscal injuries occur most cammonly in patients in their thirties and forties\nwhile performing activities requiring axial loading and rotation. Classically the patient will repart feeling a \"pop\"\nthat is followed by pain. Meniscal injuries typically cause joint swelling over the following 12 to 24 hours, in\ncantrast to ligamentous injuries, which cause rapid joint swelling due to hemarthrasis. (Ligaments have\nmuch greater vascular supply than menisci, which rely on diffusion for nourishment.) Physical exam may\nshaw joint line tenderness, decreased range of motion and a positive McMurray's test. MRI provides the\ndefinitive diagnosis.\n{Choice A) An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear would cause immediate swelling due to rapid\ndevelopment of hemarthrosis. Mareaver, patients typically experience immediate inability to weight-bear and\nthen lasting knee instability following such an injury.\n(Choice C) Osteoarthritis has an onset that does nat necessarily directly follow a distinct precipitating injury;\ninstead it tends to develop insidiously over years. Osteoarthritis typically causes recurrent use-dependent\nswelling and pain as well as crepitus with range of mation an physical examination."

            "E. Subarachnoid hemarrhage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient has acute epidural hematoma. Epidural hematoma is accumulation of blaod in the patential\nspace between the cranium and dura mater. It may be intracranial or spinal.\nAcute epidural hematoma generally occurs with moderate degree of trauma tao the side of the head. It results\nfrom rupture of middle meningeal artery secandary to temporal bone fracture. Acute epidural hematoma has\na classic presentation of unconsciousness followed by a lucid interval (Patient is perfectly narmal) followed\nby gradual deterioration of consciousness. The dilation of pupil on the side of lesion along with contra lateral\nhemiparesis is cansidered very characteristic. CT scan is the diagnostic test of choice and it shows a\nbiconvex hematoma (Choice B). Emergency craniotomy should be dane to relieve the increased intracranial\ntensian.\n(Choice A) Acute subdural hematoma is secondary to intracranial venous bleeding in the subdural space due\nto severe head trauma. The CT scan characteristically shows a semi lunar hematoma and there is no lucid\ninterval.\n(Choice C) Basilar skull fracture does nat cause lucid interval, biconvex hematoma ar unilateral pupillary\ndilatation; it is characterized by raccoon eyes, rhinorrhea and otarrhea.\n(Choice D) Intracerebral hemarrhage is a grave emergency characterized by worsening coma and focal\nneurological signs. CT scan is diagnostic and it will not give lucid interval or biconvex hematoma. [tis usually\nseen in elderly patients with hypertensive stroke.\n(Choice E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage is most cammanly secondary ta rupture of berry aneurism and\ncharacterized by severe headache and meningeal signs with or without focal signs. CT helps in diagnosis\nmast of the times, but spinal fluid examination is diagnostic.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute epidural hematoma has a classic presentation of unconsciousness followed by a lucid interval followed\nby gradual deterioration of consciousness. CT scan is diagnostic and it shows a bicanvex hematoma."

He heard a crunching sound and had intense pain in\nhis left shoulder area following the injury. Examination shows bruising around the clavicle area. He is halding\nhis left arm with his right hand. There is a palpable gap in the middle of the clavicle. Auscultation shows a\nloud bruit just beneath the clavicle. An x-ray film of the left shoulder and chest shows the middle of the\nclavicle is fractured and displaced. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. CT chest for pneumothorax",

            "E. Closed reduction with figure of eight brace"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The clavicle is one of the most commonly injured bones in the body. The majority of clavicular fractures\naccur in the middle third of the bone. Injury to this bone classically occurs during athletic events and follows a\nfall an an outstretched arm or a direct blow to the shoulder. Patients with clavicular fractures present with\npain and immability of the affected arm. The contralateral hand is classically used to support the weight of\nthe affected arm. The shoulder on the affected side is displaced inferiorly and pasteriorly. A careful\nneurovascular exam should accompany all fractures to the clavicle due to its proximity to the subclavian\nartery and brachial plexus. In this case, a bruit is heard and an angiogram is necessary to rule out injury to\nthe underlying vessel.\n(Choice A) The patient already has had a chest x-ray, which is sufficient to make the diagnosis of a clinically\nrelevant pneumathorax.\n(Choice B) A clavicle fracture may rarely injure the brachial plexus. While brachial plexus injury may be\nassessed with nerve conduction studies, clinical examination of mator function of the hand and arm is\nsufficient.\n(Choices D and E) Fractures of the middle third of the clavicle, which account for most clavicular fractures,\nare treated nonoperatively with a brace, rest and ice. Fractures of the distal third of the clavicle may require\napen reduction and internal fixation to prevent nonunion. In cases managed nonaperatively, early range of\nmotion and strengthening are recommended to prevent loss of mation at the shoulder.\nEducational objective:\nAll patients with a clavicular fracture should have a careful neurovascular examination to rule out injury to the\nunderlying brachial plexus and subclavian artery."

        "explanation": "Mast head injuries are mild and will not progress to more serious clinical scenarios. Fatients wha have\nsuffered head injuries may be classified into low-risk and moderate-risk and high-risk groups. Fatients with\nlow-risk head trauma will frequently be asymptomatic or may experience mild headaches or dizziness. Such\npatients have a GCS of 14 ar 15 and have not lost consciousness. Such patients may be discharged with no\nfurther imaging or studies if a reliable individual can monitar them for 24 hours following the injury.\nPatients with moderate-risk head injuries may have any of the following characteristics: evidence of skull\nfractures, loss of consciousness, emesis, severe headache, amnesia or seizure. These patients should\nhave a CT scan. Ifthe CT scan is normal, such patients may be discharged with printed instructions {list of\nsymptoms) that require immediate return to hospital.\nPatients with severe head injuries typically display altered or lost consciousness and focal neurologic\nsigns. Such patients may have gross evidence of a depressed skull fracture or penetrating injury to the\nhead. This group of patients requires emergent imaging and assessment far intervention as well as\nadmission to the hospital regardless of findings.\n(Choice A) CT scans are superior to skull radiographs for assessing head injury as a CT scan can detect\nskull fracture as well as hemorrhage, hematoma and displacement of the midline structures in the head.\n(Choices C and D) Admission is not required for patients with mild to moderate head injuries with normal\nhead CT scans. Admission is indicated in patients with moderate injury and positive findings on imaging ar in\npatients with any severe head injury.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients with mild to moderate head injury can be discharged under the care of an adult if they have a normal\nCT scan. The caretaker is given printed instructions detailing the signs and symptoms that warrant\nimmediate return to the hospital."

        "explanation": "The patient described has a variety of related medical issues. He most likely has cirrhosis due to his\nsimultaneous alcoholism and hepatitis C infection. Cirrhosis predisposes to upper Gl bleeding, which in this\npopulation may result from a variety of causes including varices, portal gastropathy, peptic ulcer disease\n(FUD) and Mallary-Weiss tears (retching). This patient has bleeding due ta PUD that has stopped\nspontaneously. In patients with cirrhosis, upper Gl bleeding can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy to the\nincreased delivery of blood-derived protein to the small bowel. The patients flapping tremar and somnalent\nstate indicate this diagnosis. Conservative management for his encephalopathy, ascites, partal hypertension\nand PUD is indicated at this point. This includes giving an intravenous proton pump inhibitor for PUD, oral\nlactulose for encephalopathy and careful diuresis far ascites. Once he is clinically stable propranolol should\nbe used to decrease the portal venous pressure.\n(Choices A and C) Sclerotherapy, endoscopic band ligation and surgery are indicated after a patient has\nexperienced a first episode of variceal bleeding, but these procedures are not recommended for prophylaxis.\n(Choice B) A portosystemic shunt connects the partal venous system to the systemic venous system. This\ncan be accomplished surgically or with a TIPS procedure.

It classically affects\nchildren four to ten years of age and exhibits a predilection for males. Patients generally present with mild\nchronic pain of insidious anset in the hip ar knee as well as an antalgic gait. Physical examination shows\nmarked limitation of internal rotation and abduction at the hip joint. Proximal thigh atrophy may also be\npresent. X-rays may be negative initially, but serial studies will show changes in the femoral head consistent\nwith necrosis and recalcification. MRI and bone scans show findings suggestive of femaral head necrosis\nmuch earlier than standard x-rays and may be used o make the diagnosis months earlier. Treatment is\naimed at maintaining placement of the femoral head within the acetabulum so that it may heal in the proper\nshape and position.

        "explanation": "Paget's disease of bone, also known as osteitis defarmans, is a disease of unknown etiology that is\ncharacterized by disordered bone remodeling. Specifically, osteoclast activity is increased leading to\ndrastically enhanced bone resorption. This results in accelerated osteoblast activity in an effort to rebuild the\ndegraded bone. The result is formation of structurally inferior woven bone at various sites throughout the\nbody. The woven bone formed in Paget disease lesions is larger than normal bane and is prone to bowing\nand fracture. The most common presenting symptom in patients with this condition is pain resulting fram\nbowing or fracture of the long bones that may result in secondary arthritis of the hip or knee. Laboratory\ntesting in patients with Paget disease of bone will typically show an increase in alkaline phosphatase and\nnarmal serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Lesions may be identified radiographically with x-rays or by\nbone scanning. Enlargement of the bones of the skull in this candition may cause frontal bossing, increased\nhead size (old hats no longer fit the patient), headaches and cranial nerve palsies. Classically, hearing loss\nmay occur due to damage to the cochlear nerve resulting from enlargement of the temporal bone and\nimpingement in the internal auditory meatus.\n(Choice A) An increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage is associated with various diseases including\nMarfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and moyamoya disease.\n(Choice B) Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs in people with occupations requiring repetitive wrist flexion as\nwell as in acromegaly, amyloidosis and hypothyroidism.\n{Choice C) A predisposition far renal cell carcinoma is seen in Yan-Hippel-Lindau syndrome.\n(Choice D) A predisposition far pulmonary hemarrhage occurs in Goodpasture syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with Paget disease of bane are typically asymptomatic; the diagnosis is made when an increased\nbone-specific alkaline phosphatase is discovered an routine laboratory testing.

        "explanation": "Esophageal perforation is a condition that causes sudden-onset, severe, unrelenting pain that is located\nretrosternally ar in the neck, back or abdomen. The pain is often exacerbated by swallowing. Because of\nthese nonspecific presenting symptoms, the differential diagnosis at the time of presentation often includes\nmyacardial infarction, dissecting aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism or surgical abdomen. Mare specific\nsigns of esophageal perforation include subcutaneous emphysema in the neck or a characteristic crunching\nsound on auscultation of the heart due to mediastinal emphysema (Hamman's sign). Chest x-ray is rarely\ndiagnostic; findings may include air in the paraspinal muscles, a widened mediastinum,\npneumamediastinum, pneumathorax ar pleural effusions. The diagnosis of esophageal perforation is\nconfirmed with a gastragrafin esophagogram, which will demanstrate contrast leakage at the site of\nperforation. Patients with this condition require immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and surgical\nrepair.\nEsophagitis is a condition that predisposes to esophageal perforation. This particular patient may have pill-\ninduced esophagitis secondary to potassium chloride and/or infectious esophagitis secondary to Candidal\ninfection related to his HIV disease.\n(Choice B) Even though barium study is more sensitive for diagnosing small perforations it is not used as\nfirst line because of the risk of mediastinal inflammation. Gastrografin is water soluble and less irritating to\nmediastinum.\n(Choice C) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and other types of esophageal instrumentation are the mast\ncommon cause of esophageal perforation.\n(Choice D) Transesophageal echocardiography is used to image the posterior heart and to examine small\nvalvular vegetations (provides higher resolution than transthoracic echocardiography).\n{Choice E) Bronchoscopy helps to assess the conducting airways far pathology like tumars, hemorrhage,\nobstructions, trauma ar infection.\nEducational objective:\nPatients suffering esophageal perforation most commanly present with acute-onset severe substernal\npain.

Hematachezia typically represents lower Gl bleeding, but it may occur in cases of very brisk upper Gl\nbleeding. The most comman causes of acute lower Gl bleeding in patients over 50 years old are\ndiverticulosis, angiodysplasia and neoplasms. The patient described is most likely bleeding from ane of his\ndiverticuli. Labeled erythrocyte scintigraphy (tagged RBC scan), although not a very specific study, can be\nhelpful to identify the general site of bleeding after mare direct tests such as colonoscopy fail to identify the\nsite of bleeding. If the RBC scan identifies a bleed, it can be followed by angiography ar repeat colonoscopy\nto identify and potentially treat the exact bleeding source.\n(Choice A) Hematochezia is mare suggestive of lower rather than upper Gl source of bleeding. Additionally,\nMG tube aspiration did not show blood so an upper Gl source far the bleed is particularly unlikely.\n{Choice B) Capsule endoscopy is useful for patients with evidence of chronic Gl blood loss but wath negative\nupper and lower endoscopy. It is used to examine the small bowel.\n(Choice C) Barium enema wauld not give further information in this case as it is less informative than the\ncolonoscapy the patient has already received.\n(Choice E) Laparatamy, far blind tatal abdominal colectomy and ileostomy, is reserved only far the situations\nwhere the bleeding is persistent and its site can't be found.\nEducational Objective:\nTechnetium-99 labeled erythrocyte scintigraphy should be used in cases of Gl bleeding where the source can\nnot be identified. This study localizes the source of blood loss sa that region can be further evaluated and\ntreated by colonoscopy ar angiography."

            "F.Pericardiocentesis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This patient's history of mator vehicle accident and hypotension with no obvious source of external bleeding\nindicates possible internal bleeding. In hemodynamically unstable patients who have suffered blunt\nabdominal trauma and pelvic fracture, both intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal bleeding must be ruled\naut. This patient has already had an ultrasonogram and diagnostic peritoneal lavage performed to investigate\nhis blunt abdominal trauma, both of which showed na intraperitoneal bleeding. The next investigation should\nbe aimed at identifying any retroperitoneal bleeding caused by pelvic fractures. Mat only does pelvic\nangiography provide the best means for identifying the source of retroperitoneal hemarrhage, but it can also\nbe used to treat it. By embuolizing the offending vessel, the bleeding can be stopped and the hemodynamics\ncan be stabilized.\n(Choice B) A CT scan of the abdomen is the appropriate assessment for hemodynamically stable victims of\nblunt abdominal trauma and is contraindicated in unstable patients. This patient is hemodynamically\nunstable, and while a CT scan would identify the retroperitoneal bleeding, it would not help in treatment and\nwould cost precious time.\n(Choice C) A CT scan of the chest would not be appropriate at this stage in the patient's management. His\nchest x-ray showed a fractured rib, but no pneumothorax, aortic dissection or ather potential source for his\nhypotension. A CT scan of the chest would cast valuable time and not elucidate the source of hemodynamic\ninstability.\n(Choice D) Laparotomy is the appropriate treatment for intraperitoneal bleeding confirmed on either\nultrasound or diagnastic peritoneal lavage. However, pelvic angiography is the appropriate diagnostic and\ntherapeutic option for retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with pelvic fracture.\n(Choice E) Chest tube placement would be appropriate for managing a pneumathorax. This patient's chest\n¥-ray did not reveal pneumathorax.\n(Choice F) Pericardiocentesis is appropriate in cases of cardiac tamponade. This patient's hypotension is\nnat well explained by cardiac tamponade, which presents with pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds and\nelevated jugular venous pressure (whereas this patient's neck veins are collapsed).\nEducational Objective:\nIn hemodynamically unstable patients who have suffered blunt abdominal trauma and pelvic fracture, both\nintraperitoneal and retroperitoneal bleeding must be ruled out. Focused Assessment with Sonography far\nTrauma (FAST) and diagnostic pentoneal lavage are the appropriate tests for establishing intraperitoneal\nbleeding. If these tests are negative, then the next step in management would be a pelvic angiography to\nsearch for retroperitoneal bleeding. A pelvic angiography is nat only useful in identifying the source of the\nbleeding, but the bleeding can also be resalved via embalization of the offending vessel."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hemarrhagic shock may be divided into four classes based on the amount of blood loss. Each class is\ntypified by clinical findings that correlate with the degree of hemarrhage. A patient with a class | hemorrhage\nhas last less than 15% of his intravascular volume. Patients with a class | hemorrhage are generally alert but\nmay feel anxious. The blood pressure is normal and the major organs are satisfactorily perfused as\nevidenced by a normal urine output. The patient compensates for blood loss through a sympathetic\nresponse that induces tachycardia and peripheral vascular constriction. Patients with a class Il hemorrhage\nhave lost between 15 and 30% of their blood volume. Patients with class Il hemorrhage are generally more\nagitated. While the mean arterial blood pressure remains normal, the pulse pressure is narrowed. Urine\nautput is slightly decreased and the skin is coal and maist. All of these manifestations can be attributed to\nfurther increases in sympathetic discharge and shunting of blood from less critical vascular beds such as the\nskin. Patients with class lll hemorrhage have lost 30-40% of their blood volume and can no longer maintain\ntheir blood pressure at normal levels despite further increases in heart rate and peripheral vascular\nconstriction. Patients will begin to have a decreased level of consciousness and a further decrease in urine\nautput due ta poar cerebral and renal perfusion, respectively. Class IV hemarrhage is defined as a blood loss\naf more than 40% of the blood volume. At this point, circulatary failure and death are imminent without\ntherapeutic intervention.\n(Choice A) The systolic blood pressure in hemarrhagic shock does not typically decrease until at least 30%\naf the intravascular volume has been last (Class lll and IV).\n(Choice C) The respiratory rate is not affected directly by hemarrhage, but the patient will became\ntachypneic with a class Ill and IV hemorrhage.\n(Choice D) While patients may be anxious ar agitated early in a hemorrhagic episode, the level of\nconsciousness is typically not altered until greater than 30% of the circulating volume has been lost (Class ll\nand IV).\n(Choice E) Vasoconstriction of the skin is typically seen once a patient loses more than 15% of their\nintravascular volume (Class Il). The periphery will appear cold and mottled, and capillary refill will alsa\nworsen with continued blood loss.\nEducational objective:\nWhen hemorrhage occurs, tachycardia and peripheral vascular constriction are the first physiological\nchanges. These responses act to maintain the blood pressure within normal limits until severe blood loss\nhas occurred."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The patient described is experiencing colonic ischemia and infarction following surgical repair of an\nabdominal aortic aneurysm. Colonic ischemia follows up to 7% of such procedures due to interference of\nblood flow to the distal left colon. Cammon causes include loss of collateral circulation, manipulation of\nvessels with surgical instruments, prolonged aortic clamping and impaired blood flow through the inferior\nmesenteric artery. Patients classically present acutely following the procedure with dull abdominal pain in the\narea averlying the ischemic bowel and bloody diarrhea. X-rays of calonic ischemia are usually nonspecific\nexcept in cases of advanced disease. CT scan will show thickening of the bowel wall. Colonoscopy\ncharacteristically shows cyanotic mucosa with hemorrhagic ulcerations. There is typically a sharp transition\nfrom affected to unaffected mucosa with anly a segment of bawel affected by ischemia.\n(Choice A) Acute diverticulitis would cause left lower quadrant pain, and diverticulae may cause rectal\nbleeding, but frequently rectal bleeding does not occur in the setting of acute diverticulitis. Additionally,\ncolonoscapy would reveal diverticulae in this condition.\n(Choice B) Radiation proctitis is characterized clinically by diarrhea rectal bleeding, tenesmus and\nincontinence. Later, strictures and fistulae may farm.\n(Choice C) Clostridium difficile calitis (pseudomembranous colitis) typically causes abdominal pain, fever\nand watery diarrhea. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy ar, more commonly, by detecting\ntoxin in the stool with ELISA.\n(Choice E) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be differentiated from colonic ischemia both by the acute\nonset of the latter as well as differences in appearance on colonoscopy. Namely, ischemia typically spares\nthe rectum and involves only a segment af the calon while IBD does not.\nEducational objective:\nBowel ischemia may complicate up ta 7% of procedures an the aortoiliac vessels and most commanly\naffects the distal left colon. Patients report dull pain over the ischemic bowel as well as\nhematochezia. Colonoscopy shows a discrete segment of cyanatic and ulcerated bowel."

Perineal or scrotal hematomas are also frequently seen and such an\ninjury is mast classically assaciated with a pelvic fracture. VWhen a urethral injury is suspected clinically, the\nurethra should be assessed with a retrograde urethrogram prior to insertion of a Foley catheter. The\nprocedure can be used both ta determine whether damage to the urethra has occurred and to determine the\nlocation of such damage within the urethra. Blind insertion of a Foley catheter is contraindicated in patients\nsuspected of having a urethral injury because it can cause infection of a periurethral hematoma and can\nincrease the severity of the urethral tear.\n(Choice A) An immediate surgical repair is occasionally done in cases of anterior urethral injury. Mast cases\naf urethral injury are treated with urinary diversion via a suprapubic catheter while the primary injury and\nassociated hematomas are allowed to heal. After healing is complete, residual damage, such as urethral\nstricture, is assessed and repaired.\n{Choice B) One should never attempt to pass a Faley catheter in a patient with a suspected urethral injury as\nit can cause seeding of periurethral or perivesical hematomas and can convert a partial urethral laceration\ninto a complete laceration.\n(Choice D) The failure to void in this patient's case is not a result of failure to produce an adequate volume of\nurine. In this setting, diuretics would only worsen the patient's distress.\n(Choice E) A retrograde cystogram with past vaid films is used for diagnosis of bladder injury. Bladder injury\nmay occur following majar trauma, especially pelvic fracture. Patients typically complain of gross hematuria.\nEducational objective:\nA retrograde urethrogram should be the first step in management of a suspected urethral injury. Foley\ncatheterization in the presence af a urethral injury will predispose the patient to abscess formation and\nwarsening of the urethral damage."

        "explanation": "The patient pictured has bilateral lower extremity edema and stasis dermatitis. Both of these conditions are\nthe result of lower extremity venous valvular incompetence resulting in pooling of venous blood and increased\npressures in pastcapillary venules. This increased pressure damages capillaries causing loss of fluid,\nplasma proteins and erythrocytes into the tissue. Erythrocyte extravasation causes hemaosiderin deposition\nand the classic coloration of stasis dermatitis. Inflammation of venules and capillaries as well as fibrin\ndeposition and platelet aggregation cause microvascular disease and ultimately ulcerations will occur. Stasis\ndermatitis most classically involves the medial leg below the knee and above the medial malleolus. Xerosis\nis the most comman early finding; lipodermatasclerosis and ulcerations characterize late disease.\n(Choice A) Arterial thrombosis classically presents with a patient complaining of severe pain in a single\nextremity. The onset of pain is less acute than that seen in arterial occlusion due to embolus. The extremity\ntypically exhibits coolness to touch, pallor, pulselessness and paralysis on examination.\n(Choice B) Raynaud disease / phenomenan is characterized by arterial spasm in response to cald ar\nemational stress causing discoloration and discomfort of the distal digits. Raynaud phenomenon may\nultimately result in distal digital gangrene if severe.\n(Choice D) Peripheral neuropathy predisposes to chronic ulceration resulting from unknown ar neglected\ninjuries or chranic pressure on the soles of the feet. This most commonly occurs in the setting of\nuncontrolled diabetes.\n(Choice E) Neurosyphilis may cause tabes dorsalis, a lesion of the posterior spinal cord characterized by\nloss of proprioceptive sensation from the legs, ataxia and paresthesias.\n(Choice F) Syringomyelia classically presents with central card syndrome. Central cord syndrome is\ncharacterized by weakness of the upper extremities and loss af pain and temperature sensation in a \"cape-\nlike\" distribution aver the neck, shoulders, upper arms and hands.

He also has papilledema, which is suggestive of increased ICP (Intracranial pressure). Patients with\nincreased ICP should be treated with hyperventilation, head elevation, and intravenous mannitol and diuretics.\nHyperventilation warks by causing vasoconstriction and decreasing the intracranial pressure by decreasing\nthe cerebral blood volume (Choice E). It can also be used to prevent the increased ICP in at risk patients.\nWhen ICF is definitely elevated, hyperventilation is used to have pCOZ in the range of 30-35 mmHg. Values\nlower than this are considered extreme hyperventilation and run a risk of marked iatrogenic brain ischemia.\n(Choice A) Hyperventilation has no rale as a brain stimulant in head trauma patients.\n(Choices B and C) The purpose of hyperventilation is not to correct hypoxia or wash out CO2 in head injury\npatient, but to decrease the intracranial pressure by decreasing the cerebral blood flaw. The best way to\nprevent hypoxia and wash out COZ in head injury patient is to intubate and mechanically ventilate the patient.\n(Choice D) Brain and not peripheral capillaries are highly sensitive to pCO2 and so hyperventilation cannot\nbe used as a mean to decrease peripheral bleeding.\nEducational Objective:\nHyperventilation helps to prevent and treat intracranial hypertension by causing cerebral vasoconstriction and\nthus decreasing cerebral blood flaw."

        "explanation": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) comprises a group of disorders that invalves any abnormal\nrelationship between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. Proper formation of the femaral head and\nacetabulum depends on the proper articulation of these bony structures. Failure of these bony elements to\ncontact one another properly may cause defects in maturation of both structures. Such errors in contact\nbetween the femoral head and acetabulum result in hips that are subluxable, dislocated, dislocatable or\ndysplastic. DDH has been associated with the following factors: Caucasian race, female gender, first-barn\ninfants, breech position, family history of OOH and other congenital abnormalities. The maneuvers used to\nscreen for DOH in the newbarn are the Barlow and Ortalani tests, which act to dislocate and relocate affected\ninfants’ hips, respectively. Ancillary tests to aid in the diagnosis are ultrasound in patients less than 4 months\nald and radiographs in patents over 4 manths old. Ultrasound is preferred in patients less than 4 manths of\nage because at that age the femoral head and acetabulum have not yet assified, so plain x-rays are poarly\ncapable of illustrating the patient's anatomy. Treatment may involve use of a hip (Pavlik) harness, spica cast\nar surgical reduction.\n{Choice B) Reassurance in the setting of an abnormal physical exam, such as a positive Ortalani test, is nat\nthe best option.\n{Choices C, E, G & |) The lesions on the patient's lumbosacral region are most likely Mongolian spats, which\nare normally seen in some newbarns. Imaging studies of the lumbosacral area are indicated when a midline\ndefect, such as spina bifida, meningocele or myelomeningocele, is suspected. Classic cutaneous findings\nassociated with spinal dysraphism include a midline dimple ar tuft of hair.\n(Choice D) x-ray is used as a diagnastic test for DDH when the patient is more than 4 months ald. At that\nage, the acetabulum has bequn the process of ossification and can thus be visualized with radiography.\n(Choices F & H) MRI and CT of the hips are not typically used for the diagnosis of DOH. They may,\nhowever, be used preoperatively in planning for surgical procedures to correct the hip defect.\nEducational objective:\nThe risk factors for DOH are Caucasian race, female gender, first-born infants, breech position and a family\nhistory of DOH. The Barlow and Ortolani tests are used tao assess for hip dislocatibility.

In trauma patients,\nimmediate treatment must always include rigid fixation of the cervical spine and assessment of airway,\nbreathing and circulation {the ABCs of the primary survey). The patient is tachypneic, tachycardic and\nhypotensive suggesting significant blood loss. The first step in the management of hypotension is rapid\nadministration of intravenous isotonic fluids. The patient described has not responded adequately ta fluid\nadministration as she continues to have hypotension and tachycardia. This is suggestive of continuing\nbleeding and is an indication of surgical intervention. This patient's abdominal distention, absent bowel\nsounds and abdominal bruising suggest that the hemorrhage is most likely intraabdominal. Emergent\nexploratory laparatomy is indicated.\n(Choice A) x-ray of the abdomen is not a sensitive test for intraabdominal trauma. Delaying surgery for\nfurther diagnastic studies may lead to the patient's demise.\n(Choice B) Though the patient has a low Glasgow coma scale, infracranial bleeding can never cause\nenough blood loss to cause this degree of hypotension. Continued exsanguination and hypotension will\ncause death in this patient befare head trauma would; therefore, treatment of the acute hemorrhage takes\npriarity.\n(Choice DC) Spine injury should be ruled out in patients with polytrauma but the first priority is to secure\nairway, breathing and circulation. The continued hemorrhage is a fault in circulation and must be addressed\nfirst. Rigid fixation of the cervical spine is done prophylactically as part of the primary survey.\n(Choice E) Delaying treatment of the patient's acute hemarrhage for a chest x-ray is inappropriate. Lung\nsounds were narmal in the patient, sa severe intrathoracic injury is less likely to be the cause of the patient's\nhemorrhage than abdominal injury.\nEducational objective:\nHypotension nat responsive to fluid administration following trauma is suggestive of ongoing occult blood\nlass.

One third of injuries occur at the level of C2 and one half of\nthe rest occur at the level of C6 aor C7. Mast fatal cervical spine injuries occur in upper cervical levels, either\nat craniocervical junction, C1 or C2.\nThis patient had head trauma as evidenced by nature of her injury and epistaxis. Patient with head trauma\ncan have coexisting cervical spine injury, which should always be assessed before mobilizing the patient.\nClinical evaluation of the cervical spine in a patient with blunt trauma is unreliable. Because of grave\nconsequences of missing a cervical spine injury, it is important to rule aut a fracture ar dislocation of cervical\nspine as the first priority. In the Emergency room this can be done best with a lateral view x-ray of spine. lt is\n85-90% sensitive in diagnosing cervical spine injury (Choice C).\nAt the site of accident, when cervical spine injury is suspected, the patient should be transported with the\nneck stabilized with a collar. Tenderness on palpation of cervical spine is indicative of a spine injury.\n(Choice A) This patient has epistaxis suggestive of fracture of base of skull. However, a CT scan is indicated\nanly after cervical spine injury is ruled out and patient is stable. An alternative could be to do a CT scan of\nhead including the neck.\n(Choice B) Though the patient has an obvious fracture of her left tibia, cervical spine injury is potentially more\ndangerous and should be ruled out befare looking far trauma ta other body parts.\n{Choice D) Lumbar puncture has no significant role in assessment of head trauma and is rather\ncantraindicated in head injury unless a CT scan rules out intracranial hypertension.\n(Choice E) X-ray of head gives very little useful information and CT scan of head is a better alternative to\nassess head injury.\nEducational Objective:\nIt is important to rule out a fracture or dislocation of cervical spine as the first priority because of grave\nconsequences of missing a cervical spine injury."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Eschar is firm necrotic tissue classically formed on exposed tissue following burn wounds. When eschar\naccurs circumferentially on an extremity, it can restrict outward expansion of the compartment as edema\naccurs following a burn. As a result, interstitial pressure rises ta the point that vascular flow to the limb is\ncompromised. Clinical signs of compartment syndrome include deep pain out of proportion to the injury,\npulselessness, paresthesias, cyanosis and pallor of the affected extremity. Compartment syndrome\nresulting from circumferential compression by eschar can be relieved by performing an escharotomy. A\nmuscle compartment pressure that exceeds 30 mm Hg is also an indication for escharatomy.\n{Choice A) Prompt escharotomy is necessary in cases of vascular compromise due to circumferential\neschar. Analgesics will provide symptomatic relief but will only mask the underlying problem. Analgesics are\nnot typically required during escharotomies as the incised tissue is classically insensate.\n(Choice B) The mast reliable means of monitoring adequacy of circulation in a circumferentially burned limb\nis serial examination using a Doppler ultrasanogram flaw meter. Angiography is not indicated here as\ndiagnosis of compartment syndrome is obvious and delaying escharotomy for a radiologic study is not\nindicated.\n(Choice D) A missed fracture may cause delayed pain and swelling in an extremity, but it should nat cause\nvascular compromise.\n(Choice E) Elevation of the limb is nat a treatment for compartment syndrome. It can be used for dependent\nedema following an injury such as a sprain.\nEducational objective:\nWhen circumferential full-thickness burns involving the extremities ar chest are present, an escharotomy\nmay be necessary to prevent vascular compromise and respiratory difficulty, respectively."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Colicky or paroxysmal abdominal pain with episodic hyperactive bowel sounds attributable to peristaltic\nrushes, abdominal distension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness are signs and symptoms of a mechanical\nintestinal obstruction. Nausea and vomiting may be more frequent with small bowel obstruction (SBO) as\ncompared to large bowel obstruction (LBO) where the ileocecal valve is competent. The contents of the\nvomitus are typically bilious in proximal SBO and feculent with mare distal obstructions. Failure to pass stool\nar flatus {obstipation) indicates that a complete obstruction has occurred. The patient described is most\nlikely suffering fram a complete SBQ. A mild leukocytosis and modest increase in amylase are expected with\nany bowel obstruction.\nWhereas a partial SBO may be managed conservatively with nasogastric tube decompression and\nobservation, complete SBO requires surgical correction. This patient's metabolic acidasis, in this setting\nmast likely representing lactic acidosis due to ischemia of a strangulated loop of small bowel, is a further\nindication far laparotomy. Strangulation leading to ischemic necrosis and perforation of a SB segment is the\nmajor life-threatening complication of SBO. The absence of peritoneal signs in this patient suggests that\nfrank bowel necrosis has not yet occurred, but there are signs of ischemia that warrant emergent abdominal\nexploration to reverse the cause of his mechanical bowel obstruction.\n(Choice A) Analgesics may alleviate some af this patient's abdominal pain, and pain control should be ane\ngoal of therapy. Laxatives, however, are nat appropriate therapy for bowel obstruction as they do nat address\nthe primary pathology and may worsen the patient's condition.\n(Choice B) A barium enema (BE) would not assist in the diagnosis or treatment of SBO. A BE may be\nuseful in cases colonic obstruction (LBO) resulting from sigmaid volvulus, wherein a \"bird's beak\" sign would\nbe seen. Decompression of a sigmoid volvulus may be accomplished with sigmoidoscopy.\n{Choice C) IV fluids would be appropriate ta treat intravascular volume depletion associated with SBO |, but\nlong intestinal tubes are rarely effective in relieving a SBO, and surgery should not be delayed with attempts\nto utilize such tubes.\n(Choice E) Because this patient shows signs of small intestinal ischemia due to strangulation, he is at risk\nfor intestinal bacterial translocation and sepsis. Broad spectrum IV antibiotics may be indicated, but the most\nurgent issue is surgical decompression of the bowel obstruction.\nEducational objective:\nCaolicky or paroxysmal abdominal pain with episodic hyperactive bowel sounds attributable to peristaltic\nrushes, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, diffuse abdominal tenderness and obstipation are typical\nsigns of complete small bowel obstruction (SBQ).

Patients with Crohn disease,\nar any other small intestinal disorder resulting in fat malabsorption, are predisposed to hyperoxaluria. Oxalate\nis obtained from the diet and is a narmal product of human metabolism. Symptomatic hyperoxaluria is\nclassically the result of increased oxalate absarption in the gut. Under narmal circumstances, calcium binds\naxalate in the gut and prevents its absorption. In patients with fat malabsorption, calcium is preferentially\nbound by fat leaving oxalate unbound and free to be absarbed into the bloodstream. Failure to adequately\nabsorb bile salts in states of fat malabsorption also cause decreased bile salt reabsarption in the small\nintestine. Excess bile salts may damage the calonic mucosa and cantribute to increased oxalate absarption.\n(Choice A) Bile salt recycling and fatty acid absarption are decreased in Crohn disease.\n(Choices C and D) Hypercalciuria, which may be idiapathic or may result from hyperparathyroidism,\nexcessive calcium and vitamin D ingestion, dehydration ar prolonged immobilization, predisposes to calcium\nstone formation.\n(Choice E) Recurrent urinary tract infections, particularly by Proteus species, predispose to struvite stane\nformation.

        "explanation": "The patient described is experiencing unilateral lower extremity edema that worsens when the leg is\ndependent (i.e. while the patient is at work) and improves with leg elevation (i.e. when the patient is\nsleeping). There are many potential causes of lower extremity edema. Indeed, all of the above mentioned\nconditions may cause edema of the legs, but in the clinical scenario provided, venous valvular incompetence\nis the mast likely cause. “enous insufficiency is the mast comman cause of lower extremity edema; it\naffects approximately 2% of the population at large. Failure of venous valves allows blood to pool in\ndependent areas such as the legs resulting in an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure. This increased\npressure favors increased filtration of fluid out of the capillaries inta the interstitial tissue. This process\ncauses a decrease in intravascular volume, which stimulates the kidneys to retain water and salt ultimately\nleading to further progression of edema.\n(Choice A) Lymphatic obstruction is an uncommon cause of edema. It may result from malignant\nabstruction of lymph nodes, lymph node resection, trauma and filariasis. It classically affects the darsa of the\nfeet and causes marked thickening and rigidity of the skin.\n(Choices B & C) Impaired cardiac contraction and reduced diastolic filing of the heart may cause bilateral\nlower extremity edema due to pooling of blood in the venous circulation causing increased capillary\nhydrostatic pressure. However, respiratory symptoms and crackles an examination are comman.\n(Choices D & F) Increased urinary loss of pratein and decreased liver protein synthesis causes decreased\nplasma oncotic pressure, which results in decreased reabsorption of interstitial fluid in distal capillaries and\nedema. Urinary protein loss occurs in nephrotic syndromes as well as in most cases of nephritis. Failure of\nliver protein synthesis typically occurs in the setting of cirrhosis or other farms of liver failure where the\nsynthetic function of the liver is impaired. Other signs of liver failure and nephrotic syndrome are usually\nevident.\n(Choice G) Arterial occlusion causes pain, pallor, paresthesias, pulselessness and coalness to the touch in\naffected extremities.\nEducational objective:\nVenous insufficiency (valvular incompetence] is the most comman cause of lower extremity edema.

It is far mare vulnerable to trauma in its erect state,\nsuch as during sexual intercourse, and this is the setting where penile fracture is most commanly\nencountered. This injury most often occurs during intercourse where the woman is situated on top of the\nman because the penis may emerge from the vagina in this position and be subsequently injured in a bending\nfashion between its rigid fixation on the male and the downwardly moving female perineum. Patients typically\ncomplain of a snapping sensation and / or sound when the injury occurs followed by severe pain. The injury\nand associated snapping sensation results from tearing of the tunica albuginea, which invests the corpus\ncavernosum. A hematoma rapidly forms at the site of injury causing bending of the shaft of the penis at the\nsite of the fracture. Treatment is with an emergent urethrogram to assess for urethral injury as well as\nemergent surgery to evacuate the hematoma and mend the torn tunica albuginea.\n(Choices A & C) Surgical exploration is the treatment of choice for penile fracture, but it should always be\npreceded by a retrograde urethrogram to rule out a urethral injury. This is important because an occult\nurethral injury may be exacerbated by placement of a Faley catheter.\n(Choice D) There is na role for a conservative approach in the treatment of penile fracture; emergent urethral\nimaging and surgical correction is the only acceptable treatment.\n(Choice E) Circumcision is the treatment of choice for phimasis, paraphimosis and Zoon's balanitis. tis\nalso associated with a lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, but it has na role in the treatment\naf penile fracture.\nEducational objective:\nPenile fracture is a surgical emergency that requires emergent urethral imaging and surgical repair.

        "explanation": "The patient described mast likely has suffered a tear of the medial meniscus. Meniscal injuries often result\nfram twisting injuries with the foot fixed. The medial meniscus is more commanly injured than the lateral\nmeniscus. Patients generally complain of a popping sound followed by severe pain at the time of\ninjury. Because the meniscus is not directly perfused, effusion following injury typically is not clinically\napparent for many hours following the injury. Examination reveals localized tenderness an the medial side of\nthe knee. Locking of the knee joint on extension is generally seen in \"bucket handle\" tears, while range of\nmation at the knee is limited by pain in all meniscal tears. McMurray's sign, which is indicative of a medial\nmeniscus tear, refers to a palpable or audible snap occurring while slowly extending the leg at the knee fram\nfull flexion while simultaneously applying tibial tarsian.\n(Choice A) In cases of anterior cruciate ligament tear, the patient gives a history of a forceful hyperextension\ninjury to knee or a noncontact torsional injury of the knee during deceleration. Effusion is seen rapidly\nfollowing injury. Lachman's test, anterior drawer test and pivot shift test are used for clinical diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Posterior cruciate ligament injury is classically seen in the \"dashboard injury”, which refers tao\nforceful posterior-directed force on the tibia with the knee flexed at 80 degrees. The posterior drawer, reverse\npivot shift and posterior sag tests will help in clinical diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Medial collateral ligament injury is associated with abduction injury to the knee. The valgus\nstress test will help in clinical diagnosis of this condition.\n(Choice E) Lateral collateral ligament injury is very rare and would be seen in adduction injury ta the\nknee.

        "question": "A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a mator vehicle\ncollision. He has severe abdominal and left shoulder pain. His temperature is 36. 0C {96.8 F), blood pressure\nis 100/60 mm Hag, pulse is 110/min and respirations are 23/min. Examination shows tenderness in the left\nupper quadrant of the abdomen. An x-ray film of the chest shows fractures of the left 7th, 8th and 3th ribs. A\nCT scan of the abdomen is suggestive of splenic injury with some free fluid in the abdomen. He has nat been\nvaccinated for H. Influenza or 5. pneumoniae. Which of the following is the mast important determinant far\nsurgical versus non-surgical management in this patient?",
        "options": [
            "A. Presence of left shoulder pain",
            "B. Presence of free fluid in the abdomen",
            "C. Presence of a rib fracture on chest x-ray",

            "E. Hemodynamic stability and hematocrit values"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The spleen is the most commanly injured organ in cases of blunt abdominal trauma. Patients wha have\nsuffered a splenic injury classically complain of left upper quadrant pain; rib fracture may frequently\naccompany splenic injuries. Fain referred to the left shoulder may result fram irritation af the left\nhemidiaphragm by hemorrhage. Patients who present in obvious hemorrhagic shock should undergo\nimmediate laparotomy and splenectomy, but mast patients are managed nonaperatively with close ICU\nmonitaring and fluid resuscitation. Some patients wha have a hemorrhage but are otherwise\nhemodynamically stabilized may be candidates for angiography, which can demonstrate the exact site of\nhemorrhage and be used to treat the hemorrhage by embolization. If a patient being treated with observation\nexperiences hemodynamic instability unresponsive to a 2L saline bolus or otherwise requires a blood\ntransfusion, then laparotomy is indicated for splenarrhaphy ar splenectomy. Following splenectomy, patients\nare at a greater risk of infections by encapsulated organisms such as H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and NV.\nmeningitidis. Appropriate vaccinations should be administered in all post-splenectamy patients.\n{Choice A) Referred shoulder pain associated with abdominal pathology (Kehr sign) results from imitation of\nthe diaphragm, in this case by the bleeding spleen, which causes referred pain in the dermatomal distribution\naf the phrenic nerve roots (C3 — C5).\n{Choice B) There is poor correlation between the amount of free fluid in the abdomen and the necessity for\nsurgical intervention.\n(Choice C) Fractured ribs are commonly associated with splenic trauma but are not a determinant of\nsurgical versus non-surgical intervention.\n(Choice D) Though post-splenectomy patients are at a higher risk of infection with capsulated organisms,\nthe unvaccinated status of a patient with splenic trauma does not determine surgical versus non-surgical\ntreatment. In general, splenectomy should be avoided in all patients as the spleen has important\nimmunologic and hematologic functions.\nEducational objective:\nHemodynamic stability and the need for blood transfusion are the determinants that guide surgical versus\nnon-surgical management of patients with splenic trauma."

Acute onset of nausea, vomiting,\nabdominal pain, hypoglycemia, and hypotension after a stressful event (e.g., surgical procedure) in a patient\nwho is steroid-dependent is typical. A very important clue to the carrect diagnosis in this patient is the past\nmedical history (lupus) indicative of preoperative steroid use. Exogenous steroids depress pituitary-adrenal\naxis and a stressful situation can precipitate an acute adrenal insufficiency.\n{Choice B) Diabetic ketoacidosis is also manifested by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; however, you\nwill see hyperglycemia, and you usually do not see hypotensian.\n(Choice C) An abscess is a late postoperative complication.\n{Choice D) Intestinal obstruction is nat accompanied by hypoglycemia and hypotension, even though you\ncan see all the rest.\n(Choice F) Severe allergic reaction usually immediately follows the injection of a drug and is frequently\naccompanied by bronchospasm and urticarialfedema.\n(Choice G) Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is manifested by autonomic activation, but nausea, vomiting, and\nabdominal pain is not the comman presentation. Also, hypotension is not typically seen.\n{Choice H) Atelectasis is an early postoperative complication characterized by fever and is much less\ndramatic in presentation.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute adrenal insufficiency is a potentially lethal postoperative complication.

The patient will classically present following a fall with inability ta\nambulate and hip pain. On exam, the involved limb is shortened and externally rotated. Active and passive\nrange of motion of the affected limb elicits pain. The diagnosis can be made with AF and lateral X-rays of the\nhip, and classification of the fracture using the Garden classification system may then be made based on\nradiographic findings as follows:\nType 1: Valgus impaction of femaral head.\nType 2: Complete but non-displaced femaral neck fracture.\nType 3: Complete fracture with displacement < 50 %.\nType 4. Complete fracture with displacement = 50%.\nType 1 or stress fractures can be managed nonaperatively with toe-touch weight bearing an crutches until\nthere is radiological evidence of complete healing.

Supracondylar fracture of humerus is common in young children and adolescents secondary to\nfall an an outstretched hand. Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure within a limited\nanatomic space, acutely compramising the circulation and ultimately threatening the function of the tissue\nwithin that space. Diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made predominantly an clinical findings of pain,\npallor, pulselessness, paralysis and paresthesia. Treatment consists of immediate fasciotomy.\nValkmann's ischemic contracture is the final sequel of compartment syndrome in which the dead muscle has\nbeen replaced with fibrous tissue (Choice E).\n(Choice A) Malunion with alteration of carrying angle is another comman camplication of supracondylar\nfracture of humerus; however it is not a sequel of compartment syndrome.\n(Choice B) Mon-union is not a comman complication of supracondylar fracture of humerus and does nat\naccur as a sequel of acute compartment syndrome.\n(Choice C and D) Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is a vague painful condition seen as a sequel of infection or\ntrauma which may be minar.

In general, these patients are managed conservatively with observation and bracing, though\nsurgery may be indicated in cases where the femoral head is nat well contained within the acetabulum.\n(Choice A) In slipped capital femaral epiphysis (SCFE), the metaphysis and proximal femur slip relative to\nthe epiphysis at the epiphyseal plate. The capital femoral epiphysis remains structurally intact within the\nacetabulum. The classic presentation is an obese adolescent male with complaints of pain.\n(Choice B) In pediatric patients, the mast comman etiology of osteomyelitis is hematogenous seeding by S.\naureus. The infection tends to affect the metaphysis, with epiphyseal sparing. Radiographic evidence of\nasteamyelitis is subtle early in the course of the disease.\n(Choice D) Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common childhood myopathy, causes proximal muscle\nweakness and calf pseudohypertraphy.

He has no guarding, rigidity ar rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant making\nthe diagnosis of appendicitis unlikely. In acute appendicitis, patients initially have vague periumbilical pain that\nsubsequently localizes to right lower quadrant. Patients with a psoas abscess typically present with fever\nand lower abdominal or back pain. Deep abdominal palpation is required to elicit tenderness due to the deep\nlocation of the psoas on the posterior abdominal wall. As with any infectious process, leukocytosis is evident\nan laboratory tests. A CT scan is required to confirm the diagnosis. A psoas abscess may alsa result from\ncontiguous spread from nearby bone ar bowel.\n(Choice A) As discussed, the clinical scenario is not cansistent with appendicitis. An appendectomy in this\nsituation would nat benefit the patient.\n{Choice B) If the clinical suspicion of psoas abscess is high and CT is negative, exploratory laparoscopy\nmay be indicated to identify the primary pathology. Patients with psoas abscess are treated with drainage\nand systemic antibiotics. Drainage may be accomplished without laparotomy or laparoscopy by placement\naf a percutaneous drainage tube.\n{Choice D) Colonoscopy may be beneficial if the primary pathology is felt to be in the calon. Examples of\ncolonic diseases that cause lower abdominal pain are diverticulitis, Crohn disease, perforating carcinoma of\nthe cecum and yersiniosis.\n(Choice E) AF and lateral lumbar films may be useful in making the diagnosis of ureteral stones (if\nradioopaque), bowel obstruction and perforated abdominal viscus. A lumbar x-ray may also disclose the\ndestruction aof the vertebral bodies caused by spinal tuberculosis (Fottf's disease). Potts disease is a rare\ncause of psoas abscess resulting from contiguous spread.\nEducational Objective:\nCT scan is the investigation of choice to diagnose an intfraabdaminal abscess.

The classic presentation is with sudden-onset\nback pain that may be followed by syncope. When hypotension is present with a pulsatile mass, no further\nstudies are indicated. The patient should be immediately taken ta the operating room far an emergent\nlaparotomy for repair of the aneurysm. Mortality with this condition is approximately 50%; early recognition\nand operative intervention are essential.\n(Choice A) Fast track ultrasound is a newer modality used in trauma.

It provides\nsensation ta the anterior thigh and medial leq via the saphenous branch.\n(Choice B) The tibial nerve supplies the muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh, posterior\ncompartment of the leg, and plantar muscles of the foot. These muscles control flexion of the knee and\ndigits, and plantar flexion of the foot. The tibial nerve provides sensation to the leg (except medial side) and\nplantar foot.\n(Choice C) The obturator nerve innervates the medial compartment of the thigh (i.e, gracilis adductor\nlongus, adductor brevis, anterior portion of adductor magnus), and controls adduction of the thigh. It provides\nsensation over the medial thigh.\n(Choice D) The comman peroneal nerve gives rise to the superficial and deep peroneal nerves.

            "E. Closed intramedullary fixation of the femoral shaft"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Femoral shaft fractures are generally seen after severe direct trauma. Patients suffering traumatic fractures\naf the femoral shaft frequently present with signs of shock as a significant amount of blood can be lost into\nthe thigh. On examination, the thigh is often deformed and ecchymotic. The preferred management far\nfemoral shaft fractures is closed intramedullary fixation of shaft with medullary reaming and intramedullary\nnailing. This allows far early mobilization, improved knee and hip function during recovery and decreased\nhospital cost. In this technique, closed reduction of fracture segment is followed by intramedullary nail\ninsertion thraugh small skin insertion aver the greater trochanter.\n{Choice A) Closed intramedullary nailing is preferred over open nailing in closed femoral shaft fractures as it\nis associated with a lower risk of infection, less soft tissue disruption and a lower risk of nonunion.\n(Choice B) External fixation is indicated in certain cases of open fracture where contamination of the wound\nis significant and the placement of indwelling hardware is contraindicated or when there is significant soft\ntissue loss around the fracture.\n(Choice C) Flaster casting is inappropriate for femoral shaft fractures because there is no traction to\nmaintain femaral length and rotational position and weight bearing would be delayed for a prolonged period of\ntime thereby increasing marbidity.\n(Choice D) Flate and screw fixation is reserved only for patients wha can not be treated with intramedullary\nnailing, such as victims of palytrauma wha are unable to be placed on the fracture table.\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment of choice far fractures of the femaral shaft is closed intramedullary fixation of fracture."

            "E. Surgical tracheostomy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In managing the patient with trauma, first priority should be to establish an airway followed by securing\nbreathing and circulation (ABC of resuscitation). In a totally apneic patient like this, an appropriate airway\nshould be restored as soon as possible.\nCrotracheal intubation is the best way to restore airway in this patient. A facemask is not a mean to establish\nan airway. An orotracheal intubation needs hyperextension of neck and should be dane anly after a cervical\nspine injury is ruled out ar in case of apneic patient. Though this patient is apneic and is also at risk of having\na cervical injury the benefits of oratracheal intubation outweighs the risk and so an araotracheal intubation\nshould be done with care not to move the head. Another option would be to do a surgical cricothyroidectamy.\n(Choice A) Nasotracheal intubation is a blind procedure and it is necessary that patient should have a\nspontaneous breathing. Thus itis contraindicated in apneic patients.\n{Choice C) Needle cricothyroidectomy is an excellent field procedure to establish an airway especially in\nchildren. However, it is not suitable in adults due to risk of carbon dioxide retention especially in patients with\nhead injury where hyperventilation can be required ta prevent or treat intracranial hypertensian.\n(Choice D) Intubation over a fiberoptic bronchoscape although very effective cannot be performed so rapidly\nto meet the needs of an apneic patient.\n(Choice E) Tracheostomy is no longer a first option to establish an airway because of its complications. A\nsurgical cricathyraidectamy is always preferred aver surgical tracheastamy, however a cricothyroidectamy\nshould be converted to formal tracheostomy in 5-7 days if prolonged airway control is needed as\ncricothyroidectomy has high incidence of tracheal stenosis with prolonged use.\nEducational Objective:\nCQratracheal intubation and surgical cricothyroidectomy are preferred way to establish an airway in apneic\npatient with head injury."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acute blood loss is an indication for transfusian in patients who have last 25-30% of their blood valume\n{(1500mL in 70 kg man). Crystalloid resuscitation is generally adequate for blood loss that is less than 25% of\nthe patient's blood volume though patients with concomitant heart disease and ather comorbidities may\nrequire transfusion with lesser blood losses. An effective general guideline for treating a bleeding patient is to\ninitially resuscitate with crystalloids. ZL are administered very quickly. If the patient continues to show signs\naf hemodynamic instability after infusion of 2L of crystalloid, blood transfusion should be initiated.\n(Choice A) The hematocrit is not a good indicator in acute blood loss because acute blood loss results in a\nproportional loss of bath erythrocytes and plasma. Acutely, physiologic responses to depletion of\nintravascular volume, such as increased renal retention of water, have not had an opportunity to dilute the\nblood and cause a drap in hematocrit.\n(Choice C) Hypoxia in a trauma patient could be due to pneumothorax, hemaotharax, cardiac tamponade,\npulmonary contusion etc. Hypoxia alone is nat an indication for blood transfusion.\n(Choices D and F) Acidosis in trauma patients is mast likely due to inadequate tissue perfusion. This could\nbe from any reason and need not be from blood lass. For example cardiac tamponade or pneumothorax can\ncause hypotension and resultant lactic acidosis. Decreased urine output is to the result of inadequate renal\nperfusion, which may be corrected in many patients with crystalloids alone.\n{Choice E) Even though a femaral fracture may be associated with a potential hemarrhage, the presence of\na fracture alone is not an indication for blood transfusion.\nEducational Objective:\nAn acute blood loss in excess of 1500 ml usually requires a blood transfusion. The hematocrit is a paar\nindicator of acute blood loss as it generally remains near the normal level in the time period immediately\nfollowing hemorrhage."

        "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is consistent with a femoral artery aneurysm. A pulsatile groin mass below\nthe inguinal ligament is characteristic, anteriar thigh pain is due to the compression of the femoral nerve that\nruns lateral to the artery. Femaral artery aneurysm is the second most comman peripheral artery aneurysm\nafter popliteal aneurysm. It may be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n{Choice E) Femoral hernias are located below the inguinal ligament, but are not pulsatile.\n(Choices C and D) Inguinal hernias are located above the inguinal ligament; an indirect hernia may descend\ninta the scrotum.\n(Choice A) Femoral vein dilatation usually results from AV fistula (typically traumatic); venous hypertension\nusually results.\nEducational Objective:\nPeripheral artery aneurysm manifests as a pulsatile mass that can compress adjacent structures (nerves,\nveins), and can result in thrombosis and ischemia.

        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Complications from central venous catheter (CVC) placement occur in 1-5% of cases and include arterial\npuncture, pneumothorax, hemothorax, thrombosis, air embolism, sepsis, vascular perforation and myacardial\nperforation leading to tamponade. Thus radiographic confirmation of the position of the catheter tip is\nrequired following CVC insertion. Ta avoid myocardial perforation, the catheter tip should be located proximal\nto the cardiac silhouette or proximal to the angle between the trachea and the right mainstem\nbronchus. Ideally, the catheter tip should lie in the superior vena cava; tip placement in smaller veins like the\nsubclavian, jugular, azygous or internal mammary predisposes to vascular perforation. Chest x-ray is also\nrequired to ensure the absence of iatrogenic pneumatharax and hemaothorax.\n(Choice A) CYC insertion via the jugular vein carries similar risks for pneumatharax and myocardial\nperforation as the subclavian approach. The femoral approach is less likely to cause pneumathorax but is\nsignificantly mare prone to infection.\n(Choice B) There is no value to monitoring cardiac electrical activity during CVC insertion.\n{Choice C) Aspiration of blood assures only that the tip of the catheter is within the vasculature. It does not\ndetermine the location of the catheter tip or negate the risk of pneumothorax.\n(Choice D) Cardiac ultrasound can detect fluid in the pericardium but cannot precisely determine the\nplacement of the CVC catheter tip ar the presence of pneumatharax.\nEducational objective:\nA chest x-ray is required following central line placement ta ensure proper positioning and absence of\npneumothorax."

It results\nfrom inadequate colonic collateral arterial perfusion to the left and sigmoid colon after lass of the inferior\nmesenteric artery during aartic graft placement. Patients present with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.\nFever and leukocytosis may also be present. This adverse effect can be minimized by checking sigmaid\ncolon perfusion following placement of the aortic graft.\n(Choice A) C. difficile is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea.

The pain of appendicitis typically begins as\ndull, vague periumbilical pain consistent with midgut visceral pain due to stretching of the appendiceal\nwall. As inflammation of the peritoneum in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) ensues, the pain localizes ta that\nregion and becomes sharp in quality. At this time pain is elicited upon palpation of McBurney's paint in the\nRL, and ELQ pain can be reproduced upon deep palpation of the left lower quadrant (Rovsing's\nsign). Appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis. Patients with a classic presentation of appendicitis should be\noperated on immediately ta remove the inflamed appendix and prevent appendiceal rupture.\n(Choice A) Ultrasound of the abdomen when appendicitis is suspected is utilized in women in whom other\npathology, such as an ovarian process, may be the cause of disease.

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Compartment syndrome may be caused by direct trauma (hemorrhage), prolonged compression of an\nextremity ar after revascularization of an acutely ischemic limb. Muscles af the extremity are encased in\nfascial compartments that do not allow for expansion of tissue. Blood flaw at the capillary level relies on the\npressure difference between the arterial and venous systems. Hemarrhage or edema within muscle causes\nincreased pressure within the nan-distensible fascial compartment. This increased pressure interferes with\nperfusion by disallowing passage of blood from the arterial system into the capillary beds of the affected\nmuscles. This eventually leads to muscle necrosis. Patients with compartment syndrome classically\ncomplain of severe pain that is worsened on passive range of motion, paresthesias, pallor and paresis of the\naffected limb. Pressure in the compartments can be measured directly using a needle and pressure\ntransducing catheter system. Pressures over 30 mmHg may result in cessation of blood flow through the\ncapillaries and should be treated emergently by fasciotomy.\n{Choice A) Increasing the dase of narcotics can be disastrous if compartment syndrome is not first ruled out.\n(Choice B) If compartment syndrome has been ruled out and the leg swelling is due to edema, then elevation\nand ice may be a good choice. After compartment syndrome is relieved by fasciotomy, the leq is always\nelevated as well.\n(Choice C) Displacement of the femur fracture would not cause severe pain unresponsive to narcotics or\npallor. Compartment syndrome is the most acute cause of the patient's symptoms and should be addressed\nand ruled out first. An x-ray is not diagnostic of compartment syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with compartment syndrome complain of severe pain, pain with passive range of mation,\nparesthesias as well as pallor and paresis of the affected limb. The presence of pulses does nat rule out\ncompartment syndrome. Fasciotomy is the treatment and must be done urgently."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The constellation of clinical findings in this patient is most consistent with esophageal perforation. First, the\npatient has chronic pancreatitis resulting from alcohal abuse. Exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis are\nfrequently precipitated by alcohol cansumption; such patients should be admonished to never consume\nalcohol. Exacerbation of the chronic pancreatitis has caused epigastric pain and tenderness as well as\nvomiting. Spontaneous rupture of the esophagus (Boorhave syndrome) can occur during episodes of\nvomiting, particularly when the patient is resisting the vomiting reflex. This results because high\nintraabdominal pressures are transmitted into the mediastinal esophagus where the transmural difference in\npressure is large due to negative intrathoracic pressure. Esophageal rupture in this setting typically accurs a\nfew centimeters above the gastroesophageal junction. The retrosternal pain and crepitus in the suprasternal\nnotch are the result of pneumamediastinum, which commanly occurs following rupture of the esophagus\nwithin the mediastinum.\n(Choice A) Pneumamediastinum may accompany a pneumothorax, but pneumothorax would have\ndecreased or absent breath sounds an the affected side.\n(Choice B) Acute pancreatitis causes epigastric pain radiating to the back but would not directly result in\npneumamediastinum. It may, however cause a left pleural effusion.\n(Choice C) A perforated duodenal ulcer would cause epigastric pain, and air would be visualized under the\ndiaphragm on upright abdominal X-ray, but pneumomediastinum is not associated with duodenal perforation.\n(Choice E) A Mallory-Weiss tear is an incomplete mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction usually\nresulting from protracted vomiting. The common presentation is self-limited\nhematemesis. Pneumomediastinum does not occur in such tears because the rupture is incomplete.\n(Choice F) Myocardial infarction presents with crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left shoulder\nand arm typically in a patient with risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and a\npositive family history of caranary artery disease.\nEducational Objective:\nEsophageal rupture mast commanly occurs following instrumentation of the esophagus.

SCFE is characterized by displacement of\nfemoral head aon the femoral neck due to disruption of the proximal femoral growth plate. This condition is\ncommanly seen in obese adolescent boys. The physis, the physical junction between the femaral head and\nneck, weakens during early adolescence because it is rapidly expanding and composed primarily of cartilage,\nwhich does not possess the strength of bone. When exposed to excessive shear stress, which is magnified\nby obesity, the physis fractures and the femoral head slips posteriorly and medially relative to the femoral\nneck. Patients typically present with hip or knee pain of insidious onset causing limping. Acute presentations\nmay occur. Diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion because knee pain, nat hip pain, is a\ncommon presenting complaint with this condition. Physical examination shows loss of abduction and internal\nrotation of the hip, and patients hald the thigh in external rotation while the hip is being flexed. A frog-leg\nlateral view x-ray of the hip is the diagnastic imaging technique of choice. SCFE should be treated promptly\nwith surgical pinning of the slipped epiphysis where it lays (in situ) in order to lessen the risk of avascular\nnecrosis of femoral head and chondralysis.\n(Choice A) Joint aspiration and microscopic analysis would be useful in the diagnosis of a septic joint or a\ncrystal-induced arthropathy.\n(Choice B) Conservative management with rest and analgesics is indicated for the treatment of tendinous or\nligamentous strains\n(Choice C) Closed reduction is nat advised due to the risk of further damage ta the tenuous blood supply of\nfemoral head, which may lead to avascular necrosis.\n(Choice D) Carrective osteotomies may cause avascular necrosis and may not correct the exact anatomic\ndeformity. They are usually undertaken later in treatment If a patient experiences persistent pain and\nlimitation of range of mation after initial repairs and attempted rehabilitation.\nEducational objective:\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) typically occurs in obese early adolescent males.

        "explanation": "This patient has an injury to medial collateral ligament of the knee. The medial collateral ligament is the most\ncommonly injured ligament of the knee. Forceful abduction of the knee, often with a tarsional component of\nmotion causes most injuries to this ligament. On examination, the knee joint is swollen due to effusion with\ntenderness over medial aspect of the knee. Because the medial collateral ligament resists valgus\nangulations (abduction) at the knee, injury ta this ligament leads to increased angulation of the effected knee\nan valgus stress. MRI is the investigation of choice far assessment of soft tissue injuries of the knee. MRI is\nable to detect complete and partial tears, the exact site of ligamentous injury and associated injuries to other\nligaments or the meniscus.\n(Choice A) CT scan does not visualize the soft tissue of the knee joint (tendons, ligaments, meniscus) as\nwell as MRI.\n(Choice B) Swelling in this patient is due to effusion associated with ligamentous injury; fluid examination is\nnot needed. Joint aspiration is useful in the diagnosis of septic arthritis and crystal-induced arthritis.\n(Choice C) Arthroscopy is an invasive procedure and is reserved far cases where MRI is inconclusive ar\nsurgical treatment of lesion is necessary.\n(Choice E) Flain radiographs are of limited use in confirming the diagnosis of ligamentous injury though they\nshould be obtained for all patients with traumatic knee injury.\nEducational Objective:\nMR! is the investigation of choice for defining soft tissue injuries of the knee.

            "E. Perform lumbar puncture ta rule out meningitis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This patient initially was admitted for acute pancreatitis. The patient is usually afebrile in uncomplicated\npancreatitis. Alcohol abuse and gallstones account for over 80% of cases of pancreatitis; this patient likely\nabuses alcohol given his social history, his elevated MCV and his withdrawal-like tremulousness and\nformication. A well-known complication of acute pancreatitis is pseudocyst formation. Pancreatic\npseudocysts are defined as collections of pancreatic secretions within a fibrous capsule, usually within the\npancreas. Pseudocysts are typically diagnosed when a patient with acute pancreatitis fails ta improve\nclinically with standard supportive care. Pseudaocysts may uncommanly became infected resulting in a\npancreatic abscess. Pancreatic abscess is typically accompanied by fever and leukocytosis and may result\nin bacteremia, as described in this patient. Treatment includes antibiotics and drainage of the abscess.\n(Choice B) Conservative management is indicated for uncomplicated pseudocysts. Pseudaocysts may be\ncomplicated by infection, rupture or hemorrhage; these complications require intervention.\n{Choice C) Infective endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser most commanly results from S. aureus\ncolonization of the right heart valves. This is not the most likely cause of this patient's bacteremia, so an\nechocardiogram is not indicated at this time.\n(Choice D) Pancreatic cancer is not a likely cause of the patient's acute issues. CA 18-8 levels are not\nindicated in the acute management of this patient.\n{Choice E) His disorientation, tremor and hallucinations are probably due ta alcohol withdrawal. There is no\nneed for lumbar puncture at this time.\nEducational Objective:\n& cystic lesion involving the pancreas an CT scan in the setting of acute pancreatitis with systemic toxicity\nmust be considered an abscess and should be treated with drainage. In the absence of systemic toxicity, a\npseudocyst may be presumed and managed expectantly."

            "E. Advise the mother of the suspected abuse, but do not notify authorities because this is a violation\naf patient confidentiality"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Civer 1% of children in the United States are victims of child maltreatment, which can take on many forms\nincluding physical or sexual abuse, psychalogical abuse, neglect or Munchausen disease by proxy. Most\ncases of child abuse that present for medical evaluation will enter the medical system via the emergency\ndepartment. Emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for abuse. Ta reinforce the\nneed for reporting, many local authorities have implemented policies including fines ar imprisonment far\nfailing to report suspected abuse to child protective services. Factors that may indicate child abuse include\nbut are not limited to the following:\n1. Patterned scalds and burns indicative of forceful immersion or the use of a hot object such as a\ncigarette or curling iron\n2. Incoherent ar improbable explanation of the injuries\n3. Delay in seeking care after the injury\n4. Fractures of the long bones or ribs, fractures in various stages of healing\n4. Bruising on areas ather than those overlying bony prominences\nB. Suspicious bruises include thase an the thighs, abdomen, cheeks and genitalia\n7. Patterned bruising such as loops fram a cord or belt ar imprints of a hand\n8. Subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages in very young infants\n9. Inappropriate affect of the caregiver\nIn any case of suspected child abuse, the physician should do the following:\n1. Perform a thorough physical examination and obtain a radiographic skeletal survey in order to identify\nand document any signs of abuse.\n?. Report the case to child protective services\n3. Admit the patient to ensure their safety\nIn the case described, the wounds are most consistent with an intentional immersion burn. These burns\nclassically show a sharp demarcation between the burned and unburned skin and sparing of the bilateral\ngluteal regions because these are typically firmly pressed against the bottom of the tub thereby preventing\nburning. Additionally, the mother's stary is inconsistent with the injuries and she has delayed seeking medical\ncare for 2 days.\n(Choices A & C) The child should never be sent home in cases of suspected child abuse. It is mandatory to\nrepart the case to child protective services and hald the patient in the hospital. Maintaining the water\ntemperature below 140 F helps prevents scalds in most of the cases.\n(Choice D) The caregiver should never be confronted in case of suspected child abuse. They should simply\nbe informed that abuse is suspected and will be investigated by the appropriate autharities. Accusations\nshould not be made by the physician.\n(Choice E) Physicians are mandatory reporters for suspected child abuse or domestic abuse. tis illegal to\nnot report such incidents.\nEducational objective:\nIn cases af suspected child abuse, physicians are required to thoroughly examine the child for documentation\naf all potential signs of abuse. This includes a complete skeletal survey. Child protective services should be\nnotified of all suspected cases immediately, and the patient should be admitted."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The above upright radiograph shows free air under the diaphragm, a sign of perforation of an abdominal\nviscus. His presentation complaining of \"sudden\" onset abdominal pain also indicated perforation. The\npatient's history of chronic epigastric pain is most likely due ta peptic ulcer disease, and given this, the\ndiagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer is most likely. The patient's diffuse abdominal pain is the result of a\nchemical peritonitis due to the release of gastric secretions into the peritoneum.\n(Choices A and F) Cholecystitis and biliary colic would not cause free air under the diaphragm though\nemphysematous cholecystitis may be associated with pneumabilia. Cholecystitis is associated with a\npositive Murphy's sign, but this physical exam maneuver is nat specific. Additionally, the presence of\ngallstones on ultrasound does not necessarily indicate cholecystitis or choledocalithiasis, as asymptomatic\ngallstones are very cammon.\n(Choices B and C) Pancreatitis would not cause free air under the diaphragm. Additionally, pancreatitis is\nclassically associated with dull, \"boring\" epigastric pain that radiates to the midback.\n(Choice E) Any perfarated viscus can give free air. Diverticulitis usually starts with left lower quadrant pain\nand usually does nat have the dramatic presentation with sudden abdominal pain.\nEducational Objective:\nFerforated peptic ulcer causes sudden onset severe epigastric pain, which spreads aver the whale abdomen\ndue to chemical peritonitis. Upright abdominal x-rays classically show free air under the diaphragm."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Respiration and hemodynamics may be altered after repair of large hernias. This results from the increased\npressure within the abdominal cavity that results fram replacement of the large hernia contents into the\nperitoneal cavity. The increased intraabdominal pressure impairs inferior motion of the diaphragm thereby\ncausing hypoventilation. Anesthetics and postoperative pain contral measures (narcotics) can also impair\nventilation. Venous return ta the heart is also decreased due to increased intraabdominal pressure; this may\nresult in hypotension If severe. The arterial blood gas values in this patient are consistent with hypoventilation\n(slightly decreased pH, increased pCO2, hypoxemia). Early physiotherapy and respiratory exercises\n(blowing against resistance] are indicated to prevent atelectasis, mucous plugging and pneumania.\n{Choice B) Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated for nosocomial pneumonia, which is unlikely on the first\npost-operative day.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary embolism would result in hypoxia accompanied by hypocapnia and respiratory\nalkalosis due to the compensatory hyperventilation.\n(Choice D) Bronchial obstruction (asthma, COPD) would produce similar arterial blood gas changes\n(respiratory acidosis), but in such cases, auscultatory findings such as wheezing and prolonged expiration\nwould be present.\n(Choice E) This clinical scenario is not consistent with myocardial infarction, which is unlikely in a 40 year old\nwith na known risk factors.\nEducational Objective:\nHypoventilation is a frequent occurrence after abdominal hernia repair and early physiotherapy and respiratary\nexercises are indicated to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia."

            "F. Femoral nerve lesion"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The differential diagnosis for unilateral hip pain in a middle-aged adult is broad, and includes infection, trauma,\narthritis, bursitis, and radiculopathy. This particular patient's presentation is most consistent with trochanteric\nbursitis. Trochanteric bursitis is inflammation of the bursa surrounding the insertion of the gluteus medius\nanta the femur's greater trochanter. Excessive frictional forces secondary to overuse, trauma, joint crystals,\nar infection are responsible. Patients with this condition complain of hip pain when pressure is applied (as\nwhen sleeping) and with external rotation ar resisted abduction.\n(Choice A) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a condition that primarily affects obese male children during\nlate childhood ar early adolescence.\n(Choice B) In Paget's disease of the bone (osteitis deformans), bane turnover is accelerated in localized\nareas resulting in focal bony hypertrophy. Affected bone is weak and prone to pathologic fractures. This\ncondition tends to affect elderly patients and is asymptomatic in up to 75% of cases.\n(Choice C) Aortoiliac peripheral vascular disease may cause buttock, thigh, or hip pain and claudication. In\nmen it may also cause erectile dysfunction {Leriche syndrome). The pain in this condition is exercise-\ninduced and relieved by rest.\n(Choice E) Hip osteoarthritis causes pain localized deep within the joint (in contrast to the superficial\ntenderness here) that may be referred ta the inguinal area or rarely ta the knee. Hip osteoarthritis is\nuncommon befare the age of 50. Classically, internal rotation of the hip worsens this pain.\n(Choice F) The femaral nerve provides sensation to the hip joint and to the skin of the anterior and medial\nthigh and leg. Thus, neuropathy of the femaral nerve would not cause superficial pain over the lateral\nhip. Superficial pain referred to the upper lateral thigh would likely be transmitted by the lateral femoral\ncutaneous and/or llichypogastric nerves.\nEducational objective:\nIn a middle-aged adult, superficial unilateral hip pain that is exacerbated by external pressure ta the upper\nlateral thigh {as when lying on the affected side in bed) suggests trochanteric bursitis."

        "explanation": "Duodenal hematomas most commonly occur following direct blunt abdominal trauma and are more\ncommanly seen in children. Following trauma, blood callects between the submucosal and muscular layers\naf the duodenum causing obstruction. Patients classically present with epigastric pain and vomiting due to\nthe failure to pass gastric secretions past the obstructing hematoma. Most hematomas will resolve\nspontaneously in 1-2 weeks, and the intervention of choice is nasogastric suction and parenteral\nnutrition. Surgery may be considered to evacuate the hematoma if this more conservative method fails.\n(Choice A) Exploratory laparotomy is indicated only if there are other intraabdominal injuries following trauma\nsuch as hemorrhage or bowel perforation. Duodenal hematoma is best treated conservatively. If surgical\nintervention is required, it will be a focused laparotomy or a laparoscopic procedure to evacuate the\nhematoma.\n(Choice C) Antibiotics are not indicated in this patient as he is afebrile and has no symptoms suggestive of\ninfection.\n(Choice D) Surgical remaval of the hematoma is anly attempted after conservative measures have\nfailed. Laparotomy or laparoscopy are accepted methods of accomplishing evacuation of the hematoma.\n(Choice E) MRI will not provide any additional information relevant to this patient's condition.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rib fractures should be suspected in all patients with localized chest wall tenderness following trauma; up to\nhalf of rib fractures will nat be evident on initial chest x-ray. Rib fracture is associated with significant pain,\nwhich causes hypoventilation that may ultimately result in atelectasis and pneumonia. Thus, pain\nmanagement and respiratory support are the priorities in the management of rib fractures. Oral agents, such\nas opiates and/or NSAIDS are mast commanly utilized, but an intercostal nerve block with a long-acting local\nanesthetic can be used if oral or systemic analgesics are nat sufficiently effective. Intercostal nerve blocks\nprovide pain relief without affecting respiratory function, as opiate analgesics may, but it does carry some risk\naf pneumothorax.\n(Choice A) The cause of hypoventilation in patients with rib fracture is severe pain. Pain relief will correct the\nhypoventilation and intubation is nat needed unless respiratory decompensation occurs.\n(Choice B) Use of colloids or crystalloid has no role in management of rib fracture unless the patient has\nhypotension or blood loss.\n(Choice D) Mechanical stabilization of chest wall is not required in rib fractures. Infact, the external\ncompression caused by such devices may further impair adequate ventilation.\n(Choice E) Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated routinely in management of rib fracture unless an open\nfracture has occurred.\nEducational objective:\nFain relief should be the prime objective in the management of rib fracture as it will allow proper ventilation\nand prevent atelectasis and pneumonia."

Patients who present more than five days after the\nanset of symptoms, and have localized right lower quadrant findings, should be treated with IV hydration,\nantibiotics and bowel rest.\nMan-operative management is usually effective. CT scan may reveal an abscess that can be drained\npercutaneously. Antibiotics should cover enteric gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. A secand/third\ngeneration cephalosparin ar a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole are usually used. Cefotetan has a good\ncoverage of gram-negative arganisms and anaerobes; therefore, this can be used as monotherapy in this\ncase.\n(Choice A) Immediate surgery in these patients increases morbidity because it often requires extensive\ndissection, and causes injury to other argans, therefore, it is not recommended.\n(Choices B, C and E) Other antibiotic combinations given are not adequate.

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Duodenal injury may occur during blunt trauma when the duodenum is compressed between the spine\nand an external solid structure like a steering wheel or seat belt during high-speed decelerating trauma. The\nsecond part of the duodenum, being retroperitoneal and therefore the least mokile, is the mast commanly\ninjured part of the duodenum in blunt abdominal trauma. Isalated duodenal injuries can be easily missed\nbecause the symptoms are subtle. Patients may complain of epigastric pain, nausea and\nvomiting. Peritoneal signs are usually not present because the rupture is contained within the\nretroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal air on abdominal x-ray is very suggestive. CT scan of the abdomen with\naral contrast, confirms the diagnosis of duodenal injury and will also disclose the presence af a concomitant\nduodenal hematoma.\n(Choices A and E) MNoncontrast CT of the abdomen and ultrasound are not sensitive for duodenal\ninjuries. An ultrasound, however, is very useful in determining injury to many other abdominal viscera and is\nroutinely employed in the focused assessment with sonography far trauma (FAST) exam, which aids\nsurgeons in determining if a patient requires an emergent exploratory laparotomy.\n(Choice B) DPL is not sensitive for duodenal injuries because the second part of the duodenum, the most\ncommonly injured portion of the duodenum, is retroperitoneal. DFL has largely been replaced by the FAST\nexam in the assessment of abdominal trauma.\n{Choice C) Although the ascending and descending colon are secondarily retroperitoneal, they are nat\ncaommanly injured in blunt abdominal trauma because they do not averlie a rigid bony structure against which\nthey may be compressed.\nEducational objective:\nRupture of the duodenum is frequently diagnosed by noting retroperitoneal air an abdominal x-ray.

        "explanation": "This patient has suffered rapid deceleration chest trauma, likely in association with forceful impact with his\nvehicle's steering wheel. Chest radiography is the most important initial diagnostic study in al stabilized\npatients (airway, breathing and circulation secure) following blunt chest trauma. This patient's chest x-ray\nshows a persistent pneumothorax despite chest tube placement and pneumaomediastinum, and he has\nsubcutaneous emphysema (palpable crepitus below the skin) an physical examination. Though rare, the\nmast likely explanation for these radiographic and clinical findings is tracheobronchial perforation secondary\nto blunt thoracic trauma. The right main bronchus is most commonly injured in these cases. The diagnosis\ncan be confirmed with high-resalution CT scanning, bronchoscopy, or surgical exploration. Operative repair\nis indicated.\n(Choice A) Myocardial contusion classically causes tachycardia, new bundle branch blocks ar\narrhythmia. Sternal fracture is a commonly associated injury.\n(Choice C) Myocardial rupture causes cardiac tamponade, which manifests with muffled heart sounds,\nhypotension and distended neck veins. The diagnosis can be made rapidly with ultrasound, and emergent\nsurgical repair is warranted.\n(Choice D) Esophageal rupture following blunt trauma is rare. latrogenic (e.g., with endoscopy) and\nesophagitis-related etiologies are more comman. Manifestations of esophageal rupture include\nprneumomediastinum and pleural effusions.\n(Choice E) Patients suffering diaphragmatic rupture may experience abdominal pain, pain referred ta the\nshoulder, shortness of breath, and/or vomiting. Radiographic studies may show abdominal viscera abave the\ndiaphragm and/ar loss of the diaphragmatic contour.\n(Choice F) Hemaotharax may result from injuries to the aorta, myocardium, hilar blood vessels or lung\nparenchyma. Symptoms depend on the degree of blood loss and can range from shortness of breath to\nshock.\n(Choice G) Aortic injury can cause sudden death due to aortic rupture and exsanguination. Patients\nsustaining rapid deceleration injuries to the chest require radiographic evaluation for aortic injury with x-ray,\nCT scanning and possibly transesophageal echocardiography as well.\nEducational objective:\nPersistent pneumothorax and significant air leak following chest tube placement in a patient who has\nsustained blunt chest trauma suggests tracheobronchial rupture.

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acute carbon monoxide poisoning should be considered in all patients who are exposed to smoke, especially\nin a closed space. Carbon monoxide has aver 200 times higher affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen,\nand it impairs the delivery of oxygen to tissue by shifting the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve to the\nleft. Carbon monoxide toxicity affects the organs with the highest demand for oxygen first, namely the brain\nand heart. This explains the early manifestations of carbon monoxide poisoning, which include confusion,\nagitation and somnolence. Chest pain or arrhythmias resulting from cardiac hypoxia may also occur. The\ntreatment of carbon monoxide poisoning is administration of 100% oxygen via nonrebreather facemask and\nregular monitoring for at least four hours. 100% oxygen can decrease the half-life of carbon manoxide from\nthree to four hours on room air to approximately one hour. Hyperbaric oxygen can be used in severe cases\nnat respansive to facemask-administered oxygen.\n(Choice A) Endotracheal intubation is nat required for administration of 100% oxygen. This patient is\nbreathing spontaneously and is canscious, sa intubation is not required.\n(Choices C and D) A bolus of 50% dextrose and intravenous thiamine is indicated in any unconscious\npatient as an emergency measure to assess for hypoglycemia. This patient is not unconscious and the\netiology of her acute confusion is evident.\n(Choice E) Intravenous marphine in emergency setting is indicated as one component of the treatment for\nacute pulmanary edema. In this patient, marphine would be counterproductive because it would suppress\nher respiratory drive.\nEducational Objective:\nAll patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning should be treated with 100% oxygen via a nonrebreather\nfacemask. Early symptoms of carbon manaxide paisoning are typically neuralogic and include agitation,\nconfusion and somnolence."

        "explanation": "Traumatic rupture of the diaphragm may follow blunt or penetrating trauma. It is more comman aon the left\nside due to the protective effect of the liver an the right. While blunt trauma tends to cause larger\ndiaphragmatic tears than penetrating trauma, a tear resulting from either cause may be missed during initial\nevaluation of the patient as symptoms may not be severe. Typical symptoms include chest pain radiating to\nthe shoulder, shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Respiratory distress may follow. Radiographic\nfindings include bowel gas and loops ar the gastric fundus abave the diaphragm, an elevated hemidiaphragm,\nmediastinal deviation and lower lobe atelectasis. A barium swallow or CT scan with oral contrast will be\ndiagnostic. All diaphragmatic ruptures require operative repair.\n(Choice A) Insertion of a chest tube into a patient with diaphragmatic perforation with bowel herniation can\ncause perfaration of the herniated bowel. If necessary, the tube should be placed carefully anly after an\nexploring finger has determined that the path of the tube will not encounter herniated viscera.\n{Choice B) Bronchoscopy is utilized to assess the conducting airways when malignancy, infection ar\ninflammatory disease is suspected.\n(Choice C) Antibiotics would be indicated if the patient had pneumania. The x-ray in classic community-\nacquired pneumonia reveals lobar opacity. Patients classically present with fever, cough and dyspnea. An\nelevated WBC count is usually present.\n(Choice E) Angiogram is the gold standard diagnostic test for assessing vasculature. The patient's\npresentation is not consistent with a vascular lesion such as aortic rupture or fistula.\nEducational objective:\nAfter blunt trauma ta the chest, if an x-ray shows a deviated mediastinum with a mass in the left lower chest,\nane should suspect a diaphragmatic perforation with herniation of abdominal viscera."

Patients present complaining of slow onset foot pain\nthat initially anly occurs with activity but later is present during rest as well. Point tenderness over the\naffected metatarsal is present on examination. Fractures of the second, third and fourth metatarsals are\nmanaged conservatively because the surrounding metatarsals act as splints and nonunion is\nuncommon.

Treatment\nof pancreatitis is primarily supportive with intravenous fluids, NG tube suction, NFO and analgesia. In severe\ncases, antibiotics are indicated, and calcium and magnesium levels should be manitared and replaced as\nneeded. A cause for the pancreatitis should also be sought. Chaoledocolithiasis is the mast comman cause\naf pancreatitis, and an ultrasound study early in the disease process may detect the offending stone before it\nis passed.\n{Choice A) The patient has evidence of a mild metabolic alkalosis {increased HCO3-) most likely due to\nvomiting. Bicarbonate is not indicated at this time.\n(Choice B) Evidence does not support the use of pancreatic protease inhibitors in acute pancreatitis.\n(Choices C and D) Carbachol is a chalinamimetic agent that stimulates contraction of the bowel\nmusculature. As such, it may contract the sphincter of Oddi thereby warsening this patient's pain. In fact,\nanticholinergics have been tested in the treatment of acute pancreatitis in an effart to relax this sphincter but\nhave shown nao benefit. This ileus is expected to resalve with the improvement af the pancreatitis.\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment of pancreatitis is primarily supportive.

Because this patient has just undergone a surgical procedure involving the mediastinum and has\nlaboratory and clinical findings suggestive of an infection, acute mediastinitis is the most likely diagnosis.\nMediastinitis complicates up ta 5% of sternatomies. Like an abscess, the treatment of mediastinitis requires\ndrainage, debridement and antibiotic therapy. One in five patients with acute mediastinitis will not survive\ndespite treatment.\n(Choices A and D) Fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia and chest pain might be the signs of postpericardiotomy\nsyndrome. This syndrome is autoimmune in nature and classically occurs a few weeks following any\nprocedure where the pericardium is incised. Treatment is with pericardial puncture if tamponade occurs, and\nwith aspirin ar corticosteroids to address the inflammation.\n(Choice C) Postoperative mediastinal hemorrhage is less likely to become symptomatic on the 10th day;\nmost hematomas occur within the first 48 hours of a procedure. Moreover hemarrhage would not likely\ncause fever and leukocytosis.\n(Choice E) Antibiotic therapy alone is not sufficient far this disease.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute mediastinitis may occur following heart surgery.

Anteriar\ncard syndrame is characterized by selective damage to the corticospinal and spinathalamic tracts. These\ntracts course in the anterior partion of the spinal cord and transmit motor and pain / temperature sensation,\nrespectively. Clinically, anterior cord syndrome is suggested by paralysis and loss of pain and temperature\nsensation below the level of injury while posterior column functions such as fine touch, vibration, pressure,\nand proprioception are preserved. All trauma patients should be evaluated for spinal injury. If the neurological\nexamination is suggestive of blunt spinal card trauma, immediate administration of high-dose intravenous\nsteroids (methylprednisalone] is indicated.\n(Choice A) Immediate surgical intervention far spinal injuries is currently limited to relieving impingement an\nthe spinal cord caused by foreign bodies, herniated disks, bony fracture fragments ar an epidural hematoma.\n(Choices B and D) All patients with clinical evidence of a spinal card injury should be imaged with CT scan\nto assess the bone and MRI to assess the card and other soft tissues, such as the intervertebral\ndisks.

        "explanation": "This patient's history of motor vehicle accident, abdominal wall ecchymosis, distended abdomen, and\ndecreased bowel sounds is suspicious for blunt abdominal trauma. Furthermore, collapsed neck veins and\nhypotension indicate hemodynamic instability. In a hemodynamically unstable victim of a motor vehicle\naccident with suspected blunt abdominal trauma, the appropriate management involves cervical spine\nimmobilization, intravenous hydration and FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma). If\nultrasound shows blood in the peritoneal cavity of a hemodynamically unstable patient, then urgent\nlaparotomy with surgical repair is indicated (Choice B). Ultrasound is not reliable in identifying solid organ\ninjury.\n(Choice A) The use of laparoscopy in cases of blunt abdominal trauma is debatable and hemodynamic\ninstability is an absolute contraindication to laparoscopy.\n(Choice C) X-ray films of the abdomen and pelvis would be useful for identifying pelvic, rib, or vertebral\nfractures. However, this patient is hemodynamically unstable with confirmed bleeding in the peritoneal\ncavity. The first priority in this patient is to address the source of bleeding and resalve the hypotension via\nlaparotomy and surgical repair.\n(Choice D) A hemodynamically stable patient with intraperitoneal blood identified on ultrasound should\nundergo a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast. A CT scan allows the amount of intraperitoneal blood to be\nquantified and can often identify the site of injury. The surgeon can then select either laparotomy or\nadmission and observation, based on the CT result.\n(Choice E) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage should be perfarmed in any hemodynamically unstable patient with\nan equivocal or poar quality ultrasound exam.\n(Choice F) Observation and resuscitation is not appropriate in a hemodynamically unstable patient with\ninternal bleeding. Surgeons sometimes select this course of management over laparotomy when the CT of\nthe abdomen demonstrates limited and controlled bleeding/injury in a stable patient.\nEducational Objective:\nFor hemodynamically unstable patients in wham blunt abdominal trauma is suspected, fluid resuscitation\nshould be initiated, followed by ultrasound examination. If ultrasound reveals intraperitoneal blood, the patient\nshould then underga urgent laparatomy for surgical repair."

        "explanation": "The patient described mast likely has a hydrocele. A hydrocele is a fluid collection within the processus ar\ntunica vaginalis — the peritoneal projection that accompanies the testis during its descent into the\nscratum. When the processus vaginalis fails to obliterate, peritoneal fluid may accumulate within the\nprocessus vaginalis causing a communicating hydrocele. A collection of fluid within a tunica vaginalis that\nhas properly obliterated its communication with the peritoneum is a noncammunicating hydracele. Hydrocele\ncan be differentiated from other testicular masses by transillumination; a hydrocele will transilluminate while\nather masses will not. Mast hydraceles, bath communicating and noncommunicating, will resolve\nspontaneously by the age of 12 months and can be safely observed during that period.\n(Choice A) Risks of aspiration include the potential for infection and damage to nearby structures. It is not\nreasonable to put the patient at risk for a lesion that will likely resolve spontaneously.\n{Choice B) Communicating hydroceles that persist beyond 12 months of age are unlikely to resolve\nspontaneously and put the patient at increased risk of indirect inguinal hernia. Surgical intervention is\nindicated in such cases.\n(Choice C) Ultrasound imaging of the mass described is not unreasonable but is not required as the\ndiagnosis is apparent by physical exam.\n(Choice E) MNephrotic syndrome generally causes generalized edema. It is very unlikely in this patient.\nEducational Objective:\nMost cases of hydrocele will disappear spontaneously by the age of 12 months and can be safely observed\nduring that period. Hydroceles that do not resolve spontaneously should be removed surgically due to the risk\naf inguinal hernia."

She smokes ane pack of cigarettes\nevery day. She had a baseline mammogram at age 35, which showed no abnormalities. Examination shows\na smooth, soft, mobile mass palpable in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, some diffuse nodularity is\npresent bilaterally. Vital signs are normal.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fibrocystic condition of the breast is the most common cause of benign breast masses. It is most common\nin wamen 30 to 50 years of age. Presentation is classically with breast pain that worsens around the time of\nmenses. The breast masses associated with fibracystic disease often occur and resolve rapidly. On exam\nthe cysts are tender and mobile. Because carcinoma can nat be completely ruled out, fine needle aspiration\nbiopsy of a representative or dominant mass is indicated. Typically, the aspirate from such masses is\nseraus and non-bloody, and typically the cysts disappear completely after aspiration. After aspiration, the\nmass should be observed for recurrence, and if the mass does recur a tissue biopsy is indicated.\n{Choices A and E) Mammogram would be indicated if the mass did not disappear completely ar if its\ncontents were bloody. If the normal breast tissue is dense, as in young women, a mass may nat be seen on\nmammogram. In such cases, ultrasound would be indicated.\n(Choice B) Oral contraceptives may worsen the discomfort associated with fibrocystic change as estrogen\nis believed ta be a causative factor. Additionally, this patient is a smoker over age 35 and thus use of OCFs\nincreases the risk of thromboembalic disease.\n(Choice D) There is no need to send the naonbloody aspirate for cytologic evaluation as false negative results\nmay cause an inappropriate sense of security.\nEducational Objective:\nA breast mass that produces a non-bloody aspirate and disappears completely on aspiration does not need\nany further evaluation other than observation far recurrence."

            "E. Give her aral steroids"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient is experiencing anaphylactic shock secandary to a bee sting. This is a type 1 hypersensitivity\nreaction classically mediated by widespread IgE-dependent mast cell and basophil degranulation following\nexposure to an antigen. The most common causes of such reactions are antibiotics, hymenaptera stings\nand food. One must have been previously exposed to the offending antigen in order to experience\nanaphylaxis as the reaction results from preformed IgE, which itself results from a Th2-dependent response\nto the initial antigen exposure. Patients experiencing anaphylaxis typically first experience pruritus, flushing\nand urticaria. Respiratory symptoms such as chest tightness, stridar and a \"full\" ar \"lumpy\" sensation in the\nthroat follow and may ultimately progress ta respiratory distress and failure due to laryngeal\nedema. Widespread histamine-mediated peripheral vasodilation causes hypotension and ultimately\ncirculatory collapse. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and should be promptly treated with subcutaneous\nepinephrine. Epinephrine is effective because it exerts bath alpha and beta-adrenergic effects resulting in\nvasoconstriction, branchial smooth muscle relaxation and a decrease in vascular permeability thereby\ncounteracting the primary pathophysiologic disturbances in anaphylaxis.\n(Choices A & E) Glucocorticoids have no significant immediate effect: however, they may prevent relapse of\nsevere reactions and may be used in patients following the administration of epinephrine.\n(Choice C) Antihistamines are useful in facilitating relief of urticaria, angioedema and bronchospasm as\nancillary agents, but epinephrine should be given first.\n(Choice D) Removing the embedded stinger immediately following the sting is appropriate as the stinging\napparatus actively injects venom into the wound for 1 minute after the sting. People who have been stung\nshould remove the bee stinger immediately by any means. Fatients with established anaphylactic shock to\nhymenoptera stings should immediately self-administer epinephrine.\nEducational objective:\nHymenoptera stings account for more deaths in the United States than any other\nenvenomation. Anaphylactic shock of any cause should be promptly treated with subcutaneous epinephrine\nin order to acutely prevent respiratory distress and circulatory collapse."

She says that this problem started while on a hiking trip three months ago, at which point she experienced a ‘popping’ sensation in her right knee. She recalls that her knee was swollen the next day, and responded to over-the-counter pain killers. Recently, she has been having to limit her physical activities due to knee pain. On physical examination, there is tenderness of the anterior and medial right knee joint. Which of the following is the mast likely diagnosis?",
        "options": [
            "A. Anterior cruciate ligament tear",
            "B. Meniscal tear",

            "F. Stress fracture"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Injury to a number of different structures within the knee including ligaments and cartilaginous menisci, can cause a popping or snapping sensation. Damage to the medial meniscus is a common knee injury that presents as described above. Meniscal injuries occur most commonly in patients in their thirties and forties while performing activities requiring axial loading and rotation. Classically the patient will report feeling a \"pop\" that is followed by pain. Meniscal injuries typically cause joint swelling over the following 12 to 24 hours, in contrast to ligamentous injuries, which cause rapid joint swelling due to hemarthrosis. (Ligaments have much greater vascular supply than menisci, which rely on diffusion for nourishment.) Physical exam may show joint line tenderness, decreased range of motion and a positive McMurray's test. MRI provides the definitive diagnosis.\n(Choice A) An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear would cause immediate swelling due to rapid development of hemarthrosis. Moreover, patients typically experience immediate inability to weight-bear and then lasting knee instability following such an injury.\n(Choice C) Osteoarthritis has an onset that does not necessarily directly follow a distinct precipitating injury; instead it tends to develop insidiously over years. Osteoarthritis typically causes recurrent use-dependent swelling and pain as well as crepitus with range of motion on physical examination.\n(Choice D) Chronic overuse, typically related to strenuous athletic activities, can cause patellar tendonitis, or \"jumper's knee.\" Physical exam typically reveals point tenderness over the proximal patellar tendon.\n(Choice E) The anserine bursa underlies the conjoined tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles and separates them from the head of the tibia. Anserine bursitis causes tenderness over the medial aspect of the knee, and typically affects athletes and obese middle-aged to elderly women. A popping sensation is not typically reported.\n(Choice F) Stress fractures do not result from discrete injuries such as falls or other trauma. Instead, they arise insidiously secondary to repeated stress. Athletes, especially long-distance runners, are most commonly affected. The tibia and fibula are most vulnerable.\nEducational objective:\nMost meniscal tears in the knee joint occur during a distinctly recalled acute knee injury, often associated with a popping sensation. Subsequent joint swelling develops gradually, and is often not noticed until the following day. This is in contrast to ligamentous tears, which may also be associated with a popping sensation, but which cause rapid joint swelling due to hemarthrosis."

        "explanation": "This patient has acute epidural hematoma. Epidural hematoma is accumulation of blood in the potential space between the cranium and dura mater. It may be intracranial or spinal.\nAcute epidural hematoma generally occurs with moderate degree of trauma to the side of the head. It results from rupture of middle meningeal artery secondary to temporal bone fracture. Acute epidural hematoma has a classic presentation of unconsciousness followed by a lucid interval (Patient is perfectly normal) followed by gradual deterioration of consciousness. The dilation of pupil on the side of lesion along with contralateral hemiparesis is considered very characteristic. CT scan is the diagnostic test of choice and it shows a biconvex hematoma (Choice B). Emergency craniotomy should be done to relieve the increased intracranial tension.\n(Choice A) Acute subdural hematoma is secondary to intracranial venous bleeding in the subdural space due to severe head trauma. The CT scan characteristically shows a semi lunar hematoma and there is no lucid interval.\n(Choice C) Basilar skull fracture does not cause lucid interval, biconvex hematoma or unilateral pupillary dilatation; it is characterized by raccoon eyes, rhinorrhea and otorrhea.\n(Choice D) Intracerebral hemorrhage is a grave emergency characterized by worsening coma and focal neurological signs. CT scan is diagnostic and it will not give lucid interval or biconvex hematoma. It is usually seen in elderly patients with hypertensive stroke.\n(Choice E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage is most commonly secondary to rupture of berry aneurysm and characterized by severe headache and meningeal signs with or without focal signs. CT helps in diagnosis most of the times, but spinal fluid examination is diagnostic.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute epidural hematoma has a classic presentation of unconsciousness followed by a lucid interval followed by gradual deterioration of consciousness.

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The clavicle is one of the most commonly injured bones in the body. The majority of clavicular fractures occur in the middle third of the bone. Injury to this bone classically occurs during athletic events and follows a fall on an outstretched arm or a direct blow to the shoulder. Patients with clavicular fractures present with pain and immobility of the affected arm. The contralateral hand is classically used to support the weight of the affected arm. The shoulder on the affected side is displaced inferiorly and posteriorly. A careful neurovascular exam should accompany all fractures to the clavicle due to its proximity to the subclavian artery and brachial plexus. In this case, a bruit is heard and an angiogram is necessary to rule out injury to the underlying vessel.\n(Choice A) The patient already has had a chest x-ray, which is sufficient to make the diagnosis of a clinically relevant pneumothorax.\n(Choice B) A clavicle fracture may rarely injure the brachial plexus. While brachial plexus injury may be assessed with nerve conduction studies, clinical examination of motor function of the hand and arm is sufficient.\n(Choices D and E) Fractures of the middle third of the clavicle, which account for most clavicular fractures, are treated nonoperatively with a brace, rest and ice. Fractures of the distal third of the clavicle may require open reduction and internal fixation to prevent nonunion. In cases managed nonoperatively, early range of motion and strengthening are recommended to prevent loss of motion at the shoulder.\nEducational objective:\nAll patients with a clavicular fracture should have a careful neurovascular examination to rule out injury to the underlying brachial plexus and subclavian artery."

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Most head injuries are mild and will not progress to more serious clinical scenarios. Patients who have suffered head injuries may be classified into low-risk and moderate-risk and high-risk groups. Patients with low-risk head trauma will frequently be asymptomatic or may experience mild headaches or dizziness. Such patients have a GCS of 14 or 15 and have not lost consciousness. Such patients may be discharged with no further imaging or studies if a reliable individual can monitor them for 24 hours following the injury.\nPatients with moderate-risk head injuries may have any of the following characteristics: evidence of skull fractures, loss of consciousness, emesis, severe headache, amnesia or seizure. These patients should have a CT scan. If the CT scan is normal, such patients may be discharged with printed instructions (list of symptoms) that require immediate return to hospital.\nPatients with severe head injuries typically display altered or lost consciousness and focal neurologic signs. Such patients may have gross evidence of a depressed skull fracture or penetrating injury to the head. This group of patients requires emergent imaging and assessment for intervention as well as admission to the hospital regardless of findings.\n(Choice A) CT scans are superior to skull radiographs for assessing head injury as a CT scan can detect skull fracture as well as hemorrhage, hematoma and displacement of the midline structures in the head.\n(Choices C and D) Admission is not required for patients with mild to moderate head injuries with normal head CT scans. Admission is indicated in patients with moderate injury and positive findings on imaging or in patients with any severe head injury.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients with mild to moderate head injury can be discharged under the care of an adult if they have a normal CT scan. The caretaker is given printed instructions detailing the signs and symptoms that warrant immediate return to the hospital."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Assessment of the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is a component of the primary survey in all trauma patients. It serves to roughly indicate the severity of the patient's neurologic injury for triage purposes and give some prognostic information when used in conjunction with patient age and the presence of concomitant adverse clinical findings such as hypoxia, cardiovascular compromise, increased ICP and radiographic evidence of a midline shift. The GCS is calculated as follows:\n\nEye Response:\n4 Spontaneous\n3 To speech\n2 To pain\n1 None\n\nVerbal Response:\n5 Oriented\n4 Confused\n3 Inappropriate words\n2 Incomprehensible sounds\n1 None\n\nMotor Response:\n6 Obeys commands\n5 Localizes to pain\n4 Withdraws from pain\n3 Flexion to pain (decorticate)\n2 Extension to pain (decerebrate)\n1 None\n\nHead injuries can be classified according to the GCS score as minor (13-14), moderate (9-12) and severe (<=8). This patient has an eye score of 3, verbal score of 2 and motor score of 5 Thus, his GCS is 10 and is suggestive of moderate head injury.\nEducational Objective:\nAll trauma patients should be triaged using the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) during the primary survey."

        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The patient described has a variety of related medical issues. He most likely has cirrhosis due to his simultaneous alcoholism and hepatitis C infection. Cirrhosis predisposes to upper Gl bleeding, which in this population may result from a variety of causes including varices, portal gastropathy, peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and Mallory-Weiss tears (retching). This patient has bleeding due to PUD that has stopped spontaneously. In patients with cirrhosis, upper Gl bleeding can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy due to the increased delivery of blood-derived protein to the small bowel. The patient's flapping tremor and somnolent state indicate this diagnosis. Conservative management for his encephalopathy, ascites, portal hypertension and PUD is indicated at this point. This includes giving an intravenous proton pump inhibitor for PUD, oral lactulose for encephalopathy and careful diuresis for ascites. Once he is clinically stable propranolol should be used to decrease the portal venous pressure.\n(Choices A and C) Sclerotherapy, endoscopic band ligation and surgery are indicated after a patient has experienced a first episode of variceal bleeding, but these procedures are not recommended for prophylaxis.\n(Choice B) A portosystemic shunt connects the portal venous system to the systemic venous system. This can be accomplished surgically or with a TIPS procedure. These procedures are considered a last resort in variceal bleeding unresponsive to medical and endoscopic interventions and may worsen the encephalopathy in this patient.\n(Choice D) Surgery for PUD is only indicated for perforation, gastric outlet obstruction and bleeding that cannot be controlled with endoscopic therapy.\nEducational Objective:\nNon bleeding varices are managed with nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonists, such as propranolol. Such therapy can reduce the risk of bleeding by up to half."

        "explanation": "Legg-Calve-Perthes disease refers to idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head. It classically affects children four to ten years of age and exhibits a predilection for males. Patients generally present with mild chronic pain of insidious onset in the hip or knee as well as an antalgic gait. Physical examination shows marked limitation of internal rotation and abduction at the hip joint. Proximal thigh atrophy may also be present. X-rays may be negative initially, but serial studies will show changes in the femoral head consistent with necrosis and recalcification. MRI and bone scans show findings suggestive of femoral head necrosis much earlier than standard x-rays and may be used to make the diagnosis months earlier. Treatment is aimed at maintaining placement of the femoral head within the acetabulum so that it may heal in the proper shape and position. This may be accomplished with splints or surgery.\n(Choice A) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is seen classically in obese adolescent males. Patients present with hip or knee pain and an antalgic gait.\n(Choice B) Septic arthritis most commonly presents with acute-onset pain, swelling and warmth of a single joint accompanied by fever and leukocytosis.\n(Choice C) In children, hematogenous osteomyelitis most commonly affects the metaphysis of long bones such as the humerus, tibia and femur. Patients will be acutely ill with fever chills and motion-limiting pain.\n(Choice E) Developmental dysplasia of hip is a congenital disorder typically diagnosed in infancy as all the infants are regularly screened for DDH.\nEducational objective:\nLegg Calve Perthes disease is characterized by avascular necrosis of femoral head. It typically presents in children four to ten years of age with insidious-onset hip or knee pain and an antalgic gait."

        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Paget's disease of bone, also known as osteitis deformans, is a disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by disordered bone remodeling. Specifically, osteoclast activity is increased leading to drastically enhanced bone resorption. This results in accelerated osteoblast activity in an effort to rebuild the degraded bone. The result is formation of structurally inferior woven bone at various sites throughout the body. The woven bone formed in Paget disease lesions is larger than normal bone and is prone to bowing and fracture. The most common presenting symptom in patients with this condition is pain resulting from bowing or fracture of the long bones that may result in secondary arthritis of the hip or knee. Laboratory testing in patients with Paget disease of bone will typically show an increase in alkaline phosphatase and normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Lesions may be identified radiographically with x-rays or by bone scanning. Enlargement of the bones of the skull in this condition may cause frontal bossing, increased head size (old hats no longer fit the patient), headaches and cranial nerve palsies. Classically, hearing loss may occur due to damage to the cochlear nerve resulting from enlargement of the temporal bone and impingement in the internal auditory meatus.\n(Choice A) An increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage is associated with various diseases including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and moyamoya disease.\n(Choice B) Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs in people with occupations requiring repetitive wrist flexion as well as in acromegaly, amyloidosis and hypothyroidism.\n(Choice C) A predisposition for renal cell carcinoma is seen in Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.\n(Choice D) A predisposition for pulmonary hemorrhage occurs in Goodpasture syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with Paget disease of bone are typically asymptomatic; the diagnosis is made when an increased bone-specific alkaline phosphatase is discovered on routine laboratory testing. Patients who do become symptomatic typically present with pain associated with fractures or with arthritis resulting from bone deformity."

He says that he has been having mild chest pain for the past few days, but that this pain is completely different. His past medical history is significant for nonischemic cardiomyopathy for which he takes furosemide, carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril and potassium chloride. He also has HIV infection but is not taking any medications related to this diagnosis by his own choice. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), blood pressure is 110/85 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. He is in obvious distress secondary to pain.

            "E. Bronchoscopy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Esophageal perforation is a condition that causes sudden-onset, severe, unrelenting pain that is located retrosternally or in the neck, back or abdomen. The pain is often exacerbated by swallowing. Because of these nonspecific presenting symptoms, the differential diagnosis at the time of presentation often includes myocardial infarction, dissecting aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism or surgical abdomen. More specific signs of esophageal perforation include subcutaneous emphysema in the neck or a characteristic crunching sound on auscultation of the heart due to mediastinal emphysema (Hamman's sign). Chest x-ray is rarely diagnostic; findings may include air in the paraspinal muscles, a widened mediastinum, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax or pleural effusions. The diagnosis of esophageal perforation is confirmed with a gastrografin esophagogram, which will demonstrate contrast leakage at the site of perforation. Patients with this condition require immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and surgical repair.\nEsophagitis is a condition that predisposes to esophageal perforation. This particular patient may have pill- induced esophagitis secondary to potassium chloride and/or infectious esophagitis secondary to Candidal infection related to his HIV disease.\n(Choice B) Even though barium study is more sensitive for diagnosing small perforations it is not used as first line because of the risk of mediastinal inflammation. Gastrografin is water soluble and less irritating to mediastinum.\n(Choice C) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and other types of esophageal instrumentation are the most common cause of esophageal perforation.\n(Choice D) Transesophageal echocardiography is used to image the posterior heart and to examine small valvular vegetations (provides higher resolution than transthoracic echocardiography).\n(Choice E) Bronchoscopy helps to assess the conducting airways for pathology like tumors, hemorrhage, obstructions, trauma or infection.\nEducational objective:\nPatients suffering esophageal perforation most commonly present with acute-onset severe substernal pain. The diagnostic study of choice when esophageal perforation is suspected is a gastrografin contrast esophagogram."

On admission, his temperature was 36.6C (97.9F), blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg with no orthostatic change, pulse was 90/min and respirations were 14/min. Nasogastric tube drainage showed normal stomach contents without blood. His bleeding stopped a few hours after admission, and he remained hemodynamically stable during that time. Colonoscopy showed extensive diverticulosis but no active bleeding source. Later that night he started bleeding again, and he is now hypotensive with a BP of 100/70 mm Hg. Packed red cells and intravenous fluid are started. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The patient described is suffering hematochezia, which is defined as bright red blood in the stool. Hematochezia typically represents lower Gl bleeding, but it may occur in cases of very brisk upper Gl bleeding. The most common causes of acute lower Gl bleeding in patients over 50 years old are diverticulosis, angiodysplasia and neoplasms. The patient described is most likely bleeding from one of his diverticuli. Labeled erythrocyte scintigraphy (tagged RBC scan), although not a very specific study, can be helpful to identify the general site of bleeding after more direct tests such as colonoscopy fail to identify the site of bleeding. If the RBC scan identifies a bleed, it can be followed by angiography or repeat colonoscopy to identify and potentially treat the exact bleeding source.\n(Choice A) Hematochezia is more suggestive of lower rather than upper Gl source of bleeding. Additionally, NG tube aspiration did not show blood so an upper Gl source for the bleed is particularly unlikely.\n(Choice B) Capsule endoscopy is useful for patients with evidence of chronic Gl blood loss but with negative upper and lower endoscopy. It is used to examine the small bowel.\n(Choice C) Barium enema would not give further information in this case as it is less informative than the colonoscopy the patient has already received.\n(Choice E) Laparotomy, for blind total abdominal colectomy and ileostomy, is reserved only for the situations where the bleeding is persistent and its site can't be found.\nEducational Objective:\nTechnetium-99m labeled erythrocyte scintigraphy should be used in cases of Gl bleeding where the source can not be identified. This study localizes the source of blood loss so that region can be further evaluated and treated by colonoscopy or angiography."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This patient's history of motor vehicle accident and hypotension with no obvious source of external bleeding indicates possible internal bleeding. In hemodynamically unstable patients who have suffered blunt abdominal trauma and pelvic fracture both intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal bleeding must be ruled out. This patient has already had an ultrasonogram and diagnostic peritoneal lavage performed to investigate his blunt abdominal trauma, both of which showed no intraperitoneal bleeding. The next investigation should be aimed at identifying any retroperitoneal bleeding caused by pelvic fractures. Not only does pelvic angiography provide the best means for identifying the source of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, but it can also be used to treat it. By embolizing the offending vessel, the bleeding can be stopped and the hemodynamics can be stabilized.\n(Choice B) A CT scan of the abdomen is the appropriate assessment for hemodynamically stable victims of blunt abdominal trauma and is contraindicated in unstable patients. This patient is hemodynamically unstable, and while a CT scan would identify the retroperitoneal bleeding, it would not help in treatment and would cost precious time.\n(Choice C) A CT scan of the chest would not be appropriate at this stage in the patient's management. His chest x-ray showed a fractured rib, but no pneumothorax, aortic dissection or other potential source for his hypotension. A CT scan of the chest would cost valuable time and not elucidate the source of hemodynamic instability.\n(Choice D) Laparotomy is the appropriate treatment for intraperitoneal bleeding confirmed on either ultrasound or diagnostic peritoneal lavage. However, pelvic angiography is the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic option for retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with pelvic fracture.\n(Choice E) Chest tube placement would be appropriate for managing a pneumothorax. This patient's chest x-ray did not reveal pneumothorax.\n(Choice F) Pericardiocentesis is appropriate in cases of cardiac tamponade. This patient's hypotension is not well explained by cardiac tamponade, which presents with pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds and elevated jugular venous pressure (whereas this patient's neck veins are collapsed).\nEducational Objective:\nIn hemodynamically unstable patients who have suffered blunt abdominal trauma and pelvic fracture, both intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal bleeding must be ruled out. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) and diagnostic peritoneal lavage are the appropriate tests for establishing intraperitoneal bleeding. If these tests are negative, then the next step in management would be a pelvic angiography to search for retroperitoneal bleeding. A pelvic angiography is not only useful in identifying the source of the bleeding, but the bleeding can also be resolved via embolization of the offending vessel."

The injury can occur innocently from swinging a young child by the arms or pulling a child's arm while in a hurry. The child is usually not in distress at presentation but would cry at any attempt to flex the elbow or supinate the forearm. Diagnosis is made clinically as radiographs are often normal.\nTreatment of this condition is closed reduction (Choice C) in following steps:\n* First extend and distract the elbow.\n* Next supinate the forearm.\n* Hyper flex the elbow with your thumb over the radial head in order to feel the reduction as it occurs.\nNo post reduction films are needed, since success is usually demonstrated by the infant who has resumed the use of previously unused extremity.\n(Choice A and D) are not needed, as this is a temporary condition without permanent effect.\n(Choice B and E) are not needed, as subluxation of radial head is a very common injury in preschool children, which is most commonly accidental.

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hemorrhagic shock may be divided into four classes based on the amount of blood loss. Each class is typified by clinical findings that correlate with the degree of hemorrhage. A patient with a class I hemorrhage has lost less than 15% of his intravascular volume. Patients with a class I hemorrhage are generally alert but may feel anxious. The blood pressure is normal and the major organs are satisfactorily perfused as evidenced by a normal urine output. The patient compensates for blood loss through a sympathetic response that induces tachycardia and peripheral vascular constriction. Patients with a class II hemorrhage have lost between 15 and 30% of their blood volume. Patients with class II hemorrhage are generally more agitated. While the mean arterial blood pressure remains normal, the pulse pressure is narrowed. Urine output is slightly decreased and the skin is cool and moist. All of these manifestations can be attributed to further increases in sympathetic discharge and shunting of blood from less critical vascular beds such as the skin. Patients with class III hemorrhage have lost 30-40% of their blood volume and can no longer maintain their blood pressure at normal levels despite further increases in heart rate and peripheral vascular constriction. Patients will begin to have a decreased level of consciousness and a further decrease in urine output due to poor cerebral and renal perfusion, respectively. Class IV hemorrhage is defined as a blood loss of more than 40% of the blood volume. At this point, circulatory failure and death are imminent without therapeutic intervention.\n(Choice A) The systolic blood pressure in hemorrhagic shock does not typically decrease until at least 30% of the intravascular volume has been lost (Class III and IV).\n(Choice C) The respiratory rate is not affected directly by hemorrhage, but the patient will become tachypneic with a class III and IV hemorrhage.\n(Choice D) While patients may be anxious or agitated early in a hemorrhagic episode, the level of consciousness is typically not altered until greater than 30% of the circulating volume has been lost (Class III and IV).\n(Choice E) Vasoconstriction of the skin is typically seen once a patient loses more than 15% of their intravascular volume (Class II). The periphery will appear cold and mottled, and capillary refill will also worsen with continued blood loss.\nEducational objective:\nWhen hemorrhage occurs, tachycardia and peripheral vascular constriction are the first physiological changes. These responses act to maintain the blood pressure within normal limits until severe blood loss has occurred."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The patient described is experiencing colonic ischemia and infarction following surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Colonic ischemia follows up to 7% of such procedures due to interference of blood flow to the distal left colon. Common causes include loss of collateral circulation, manipulation of vessels with surgical instruments, prolonged aortic clamping and impaired blood flow through the inferior mesenteric artery. Patients classically present acutely following the procedure with dull abdominal pain in the area overlying the ischemic bowel and bloody diarrhea. x-rays of colonic ischemia are usually nonspecific except in cases of advanced disease. CT scan will show thickening of the bowel wall. Colonoscopy characteristically shows cyanotic mucosa with hemorrhagic ulcerations. There is typically a sharp transition from affected to unaffected mucosa with only a segment of bowel affected by ischemia.\n(Choice A) Acute diverticulitis would cause left lower quadrant pain, and diverticula may cause rectal bleeding, but frequently rectal bleeding does not occur in the setting of acute diverticulitis. Additionally, colonoscopy would reveal diverticulae in this condition.\n(Choice B) Radiation proctitis is characterized clinically by diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus and incontinence. Later, strictures and fistulae may form.\n(Choice C) Clostridium difficile colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) typically causes abdominal pain, fever and watery diarrhea. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy or, more commonly, by detecting toxin in the stool with ELISA.\n(Choice E) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be differentiated from colonic ischemia both by the acute onset of the latter as well as differences in appearance on colonoscopy. Namely, ischemia typically spares the rectum and involves only a segment of the colon while IBD does not.\nEducational objective:\nBowel ischemia may complicate up to 7% of procedures on the aortoiliac vessels and most commonly affects the distal left colon. Patients report dull pain over the ischemic bowel as well as hematochezia. Colonoscopy shows a discrete segment of cyanotic and ulcerated bowel."

            "E. Retrograde cystogram with post-void films"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Classic signs of posterior urethral injury include blood at the urethral meatus, inability to void and a high-riding prostate on digital rectal examination. Perineal or scrotal hematomas are also frequently seen and such an injury is most classically associated with a pelvic fracture. When a urethral injury is suspected clinically, the urethra should be assessed with a retrograde urethrogram prior to insertion of a Foley catheter. The procedure can be used both to determine whether damage to the urethra has occurred and to determine the location of such damage within the urethra. Blind insertion of a Foley catheter is contraindicated in patients suspected of having a urethral injury because it can cause infection of a periurethral hematoma and can increase the severity of the urethral tear.\n(Choice A) An immediate surgical repair is occasionally done in cases of anterior urethral injury. Most cases of urethral injury are treated with urinary diversion via a suprapubic catheter while the primary injury and associated hematomas are allowed to heal. After healing is complete, residual damage, such as urethral stricture, is assessed and repaired.\n(Choice B) One should never attempt to pass a Foley catheter in a patient with a suspected urethral injury as it can cause seeding of periurethral or perivesical hematomas and can convert a partial urethral laceration into a complete laceration.\n(Choice D) The failure to void in this patient's case is not a result of failure to produce an adequate volume of urine. In this setting, diuretics would only worsen the patient's distress.\n(Choice E) A retrograde cystogram with post void films is used for diagnosis of bladder injury. Bladder injury may occur following major trauma, especially pelvic fracture. Patients typically complain of gross hematuria.\nEducational objective:\nA retrograde urethrogram should be the first step in management of a suspected urethral injury. Foley catheterization in the presence of a urethral injury will predispose the patient to abscess formation and worsening of the urethral damage."

            "E. Posterior spinal cord lesion",
            "F. Central spinal cord lesion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The patient pictured has bilateral lower extremity edema and stasis dermatitis. Both of these conditions are the result of lower extremity venous valvular incompetence resulting in pooling of venous blood and increased pressures in postcapillary venules. This increased pressure damages capillaries causing loss of fluid, plasma proteins and erythrocytes into the tissue. Erythrocyte extravasation causes hemosiderin deposition and the classic coloration of stasis dermatitis. Inflammation of venules and capillaries as well as fibrin deposition and platelet aggregation cause microvascular disease and ultimately ulcerations will occur. Stasis dermatitis most classically involves the medial leg below the knee and above the medial malleolus. Xerosis is the most common early finding; lipodermatosclerosis and ulcerations characterize late disease.\n(Choice A) Arterial thrombosis classically presents with a patient complaining of severe pain in a single extremity. The onset of pain is less acute than that seen in arterial occlusion due to embolus. The extremity typically exhibits coolness to touch, pallor, pulselessness and paralysis on examination.\n(Choice B) Raynaud disease / phenomenon is characterized by arterial spasm in response to cold or emotional stress causing discoloration and discomfort of the distal digits. Raynaud phenomenon may ultimately result in distal digital gangrene if severe.\n(Choice D) Peripheral neuropathy predisposes to chronic ulceration resulting from unknown or neglected injuries or chronic pressure on the soles of the feet. This most commonly occurs in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes.\n(Choice E) Neurosyphilis may cause tabes dorsalis, a lesion of the posterior spinal cord characterized by loss of proprioceptive sensation from the legs, ataxia and paresthesias.\n(Choice F) Syringomyelia classically presents with central cord syndrome. Central cord syndrome is characterized by weakness of the upper extremities and loss of pain and temperature sensation in a \"cape-like\" distribution over the neck, shoulders, upper arms and hands. Patients may present with burn injuries on the hands due to loss of sensation.\nEducational objective:\nEdema, stasis dermatitis and venous ulcerations result from lower extremity venous insufficiency due to valve incompetence. Such disease classically occurs on the medial leg superior to the medial malleolus."

His pupils are bilateral round and reactive, he has papilledema. He responds to pain, has decorticate posture and speaks incoherently. After the initial resuscitation you start the treatment with intravenous fluids, hyperventilation, head elevation and intravenous mannitol. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of hyperventilation in this patient?",

            "E. Hyperventilation causes vasoconstriction and thus decreases the cerebral blood flow"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This patient has head injury with glasgow coma score of 7 (verbal score of 2, eye score of 2 and motor score of 3). He also has papilledema, which is suggestive of increased ICP (Intracranial pressure). Patients with increased ICP should be treated with hyperventilation, head elevation, and intravenous mannitol and diuretics. Hyperventilation works by causing vasoconstriction and decreasing the intracranial pressure by decreasing the cerebral blood volume (Choice E). It can also be used to prevent the increased ICP in at risk patients. When ICP is definitely elevated, hyperventilation is used to have pCO2 in the range of 30-35 mmHg. Values lower than this are considered extreme hyperventilation and run a risk of marked iatrogenic brain ischemia.\n(Choice A) Hyperventilation has no role as a brain stimulant in head trauma patients.\n(Choices B and C) The purpose of hyperventilation is not to correct hypoxia or wash out CO2 in head injury patient, but to decrease the intracranial pressure by decreasing the cerebral blood flow. The best way to prevent hypoxia and wash out CO2 in head injury patient is to intubate and mechanically ventilate the patient.\n(Choice D) Brain and not peripheral capillaries are highly sensitive to pCO2 and so hyperventilation cannot be used as a mean to decrease peripheral bleeding.\nEducational Objective:\nHyperventilation helps to prevent and treat intracranial hypertension by causing cerebral vasoconstriction and thus decreasing cerebral blood flow."

She denies the use of any drugs, alcohol or cigarettes during her pregnancy. She denies having any sexually transmitted infections. Her lead levels were within the normal range throughout her pregnancy. Prenatal ultrasound done at 30 weeks gestation showed normal anatomy of the fetus. The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes are 7 and 9, respectively. There are some bluish-brown spots located on the infant's lumbosacral area. Flexion and abduction of the lower extremities reveal a palpable clunk. The rest of the physical examination is normal.

            "H. CT scan of the hips"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) comprises a group of disorders that involves any abnormal relationship between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. Proper formation of the femoral head and acetabulum depends on the proper articulation of these bony structures. Failure of these bony elements to contact one another properly may cause defects in maturation of both structures. Such errors in contact between the femoral head and acetabulum result in hips that are subluxable, dislocated, dislocatable or dysplastic. DDH has been associated with the following factors: Caucasian race, female gender, first-born infants, breech position, family history of DDH and other congenital abnormalities. The maneuvers used to screen for DDH in the newborn are the Barlow and Ortolani tests, which act to dislocate and relocate affected infants’ hips, respectively. Ancillary tests to aid in the diagnosis are ultrasound in patients less than 4 months old and radiographs in patients over 4 months old. Ultrasound is preferred in patients less than 4 months of age because at that age the femoral head and acetabulum have not yet ossified, so plain x-rays are poorly capable of illustrating the patient's anatomy. Treatment may involve use of a hip (Pavlik) harness, spica cast or surgical reduction.\n(Choice B) Reassurance in the setting of an abnormal physical exam, such as a positive Ortolani test, is not the best option.\n(Choices C, E, G & H) The lesions on the patient's lumbosacral region are most likely Mongolian spots, which are normally seen in some newborns. Imaging studies of the lumbosacral area are indicated when a midline defect, such as spina bifida, meningocele or myelomeningocele, is suspected. Classic cutaneous findings associated with spinal dysraphism include a midline dimple or tuft of hair.\n(Choice D) x-ray is used as a diagnostic test for DDH when the patient is more than 4 months old. At that age, the acetabulum has begun the process of ossification and can thus be visualized with radiography.\n(Choices F & H) MRI and CT of the hips are not typically used for the diagnosis of DDH. They may, however, be used preoperatively in planning for surgical procedures to correct the hip defect.\nEducational objective:\nThe risk factors for DDH are Caucasian race, female gender, first-born infants, breech position and a family history of DDH. The Barlow and Ortolani tests are used to assess for hip dislocatibility. Positive physical exam findings should prompt a radiologic diagnosis with ultrasound (< 4 months old) or radiographs (>= 4 months old). Treatment may involve use of a hip harness or spica cast."

On arrival she is unconscious with bilaterally round and reactive pupils. Her temperature is 37C (98.6F), blood pressure is 70/20 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min and respirations are 22/min. There is a low jugular venous pulse. She does not respond to vocal commands but responds to pain with all 4 limbs. She is not vocalizing. Lung auscultation is unremarkable. Abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds and some bruising. She is intubated and is rapidly infused with 2L of lactated Ringer's solution. Her blood pressure is now 80/30 mm Hg and her pulse is 118/min. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

            "E. Chest x-ray"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is a patient of polytrauma with an abdominal injury and most likely a head injury. In trauma patients, immediate treatment must always include rigid fixation of the cervical spine and assessment of airway, breathing and circulation (the ABCs of the primary survey). The patient is tachypneic, tachycardic and hypotensive suggesting significant blood loss. The first step in the management of hypotension is rapid administration of intravenous isotonic fluids. The patient described has not responded adequately to fluid administration as she continues to have hypotension and tachycardia. This is suggestive of continuing bleeding and is an indication of surgical intervention. This patient's abdominal distention, absent bowel sounds and abdominal bruising suggest that the hemorrhage is most likely intraabdominal. Emergent exploratory laparotomy is indicated.\n(Choice A) X-ray of the abdomen is not a sensitive test for intraabdominal trauma. Delaying surgery for further diagnostic studies may lead to the patient's demise.\n(Choice B) Though the patient has a low Glasgow coma scale, intracranial bleeding can never cause enough blood loss to cause this degree of hypotension. Continued exsanguination and hypotension will cause death in this patient before head trauma would; therefore, treatment of the acute hemorrhage takes priority.\n(Choice D) Spine injury should be ruled out in patients with polytrauma but the first priority is to secure airway, breathing and circulation. The continued hemorrhage is a fault in circulation and must be addressed first. Rigid fixation of the cervical spine is done prophylactically as part of the primary survey.\n(Choice E) Delaying treatment of the patient's acute hemorrhage for a chest x-ray is inappropriate. Lung sounds were normal in the patient, so severe intrathoracic injury is less likely to be the cause of the patient's hemorrhage than abdominal injury.\nEducational objective:\nHypotension not responsive to fluid administration following trauma is suggestive of ongoing occult blood loss. Patients in this scenario must be treated emergently with surgical intervention to stop further hemorrhage."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radial nerve passes through the radial groove, which is on the posterior surface of humerus. It is the most commonly injured nerve in fracture of midshaft of humerus. Injury can occur at the time of fracture due to traction of nerve by the fracture end or after the reduction of fracture due to impeachment of the radial nerve during closed reduction as in this patient. Radial nerve injury would lead to wrist drop due to marked limitation of extension at wrist joint (Choice A).\n(Choice B) Brachial artery is not commonly injured in fracture of mid shaft of humerus; however, it is commonly injured in supra condylar fracture of humerus, commonly seen in children. The signs and symptoms of brachial artery injury are those of ischemia (pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia and pressure).\n(Choice C) Compartment syndrome can occur following a fracture due to increase in compartment pressure secondary to edema and/or bleeding. It would also result in 5 P's (pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia and pressure). It can occur in any compartment of body but is most commonly seen in forearm and calf. Nerve palsy is not very common in compartment syndrome.\n(Choice D) Ulnar nerve is also a common nerve injury in association with humeral fracture. Its injury would cause a claw hand.\n(Choice E) Median nerve is not commonly injured in humeral fracture and its injury would cause loss of sensation of skin over lateral three and half fingers and lateral half of palm.\nEducational objective:\nRadial nerve is the most commonly injured nerve in association with fracture of midshaft humerus."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Approximately 5-10% of unconscious patients who present to the ED as the result of a motor vehicle accident or fall, have a major injury to the cervical spine. One third of injuries occur at the level of C2, and one half of the rest occur at the level of C6 or C7. Most fatal cervical spine injuries occur in upper cervical levels, either at craniocervical junction, C1 or C2.\nThis patient had head trauma as evidenced by nature of her injury and epistaxis. Patient with head trauma can have coexisting cervical spine injury, which should always be assessed before mobilizing the patient. Clinical evaluation of the cervical spine in a patient with blunt trauma is unreliable. Because of grave consequences of missing a cervical spine injury, it is important to rule out a fracture or dislocation of cervical spine as the first priority. In the Emergency room this can be done best with a lateral view x-ray of spine. It is 85-90% sensitive in diagnosing cervical spine injury (Choice C).\nAt the site of accident, when cervical spine injury is suspected, the patient should be transported with the neck stabilized with a collar. Tenderness on palpation of cervical spine is indicative of a spine injury.\n(Choice A) This patient has epistaxis suggestive of fracture of base of skull. However, a CT scan is indicated only after cervical spine injury is ruled out and patient is stable. An alternative could be to do a CT scan of head including the neck.\n(Choice B) Though the patient has an obvious fracture of her left tibia, cervical spine injury is potentially more dangerous and should be ruled out before looking for trauma to other body parts.\n(Choice D) Lumbar puncture has no significant role in assessment of head trauma and is rather contraindicated in head injury unless a CT scan rules out intracranial hypertension.\n(Choice E) x-ray of head gives very little useful information and CT scan of head is a better alternative to assess head injury.\nEducational Objective:\nIt is important to rule out a fracture or dislocation of cervical spine as the first priority because of grave consequences of missing a cervical spine injury."

            "E. Elevation of the limb"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Eschar is firm necrotic tissue classically formed on exposed tissue following burn wounds. When eschar occurs circumferentially on an extremity, it can restrict outward expansion of the compartment as edema occurs following a burn. As a result, interstitial pressure rises to the point that vascular flow to the limb is compromised. Clinical signs of compartment syndrome include deep pain out of proportion to the injury, pulselessness, paresthesias, cyanosis and pallor of the affected extremity. Compartment syndrome resulting from circumferential compression by eschar can be relieved by performing an escharotomy. A muscle compartment pressure that exceeds 30 mm Hg is also an indication for escharotomy.\n(Choice A) Prompt escharotomy is necessary in cases of vascular compromise due to circumferential eschar. Analgesics will provide symptomatic relief but will only mask the underlying problem. Analgesics are not typically required during escharotomies as the incised tissue is classically insensate.\n(Choice B) The most reliable means of monitoring adequacy of circulation in a circumferentially burned limb is serial examination using a Doppler ultrasonogram flow meter. Angiography is not indicated here as diagnosis of compartment syndrome is obvious and delaying escharotomy for a radiologic study is not indicated.\n(Choice D) A missed fracture may cause delayed pain and swelling in an extremity, but it should not cause vascular compromise.\n(Choice E) Elevation of the limb is not a treatment for compartment syndrome. It can be used for dependent edema following an injury such as a sprain.\nEducational objective:\nWhen circumferential full-thickness burns involving the extremities or chest are present, an escharotomy may be necessary to prevent vascular compromise and respiratory difficulty, respectively."

            "D. Laparotomy"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Colicky or paroxysmal abdominal pain with episodic hyperactive bowel sounds attributable to peristaltic rushes, abdominal distension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness are signs and symptoms of a mechanical intestinal obstruction. Nausea and vomiting may be more frequent with small bowel obstruction (SBO) as compared to large bowel obstruction (LBO) where the ileocecal valve is competent. The contents of the vomitus are typically bilious in proximal SBO and feculent with more distal obstructions. Failure to pass stool or flatus (obstipation) indicates that a complete obstruction has occurred. The patient described is most likely suffering from a complete SBO. A mild leukocytosis and modest increase in amylase are expected with any bowel obstruction.\nWhereas a partial SBO may be managed conservatively with nasogastric tube decompression and observation, complete SBO requires surgical correction. This patient's metabolic acidosis, in this setting most likely representing lactic acidosis due to ischemia of a strangulated loop of small bowel, is a further indication for laparotomy. Strangulation leading to ischemic necrosis and perforation of a SB segment is the major life-threatening complication of SBO. The absence of peritoneal signs in this patient suggests that frank bowel necrosis has not yet occurred, but there are signs of ischemia that warrant emergent abdominal exploration to reverse the cause of his mechanical bowel obstruction.\n(Choice A) Analgesics may alleviate some of this patient's abdominal pain, and pain control should be one goal of therapy. Laxatives, however, are not appropriate therapy for bowel obstruction as they do not address the primary pathology and may worsen the patient's condition.\n(Choice B) A barium enema (BE) would not assist in the diagnosis or treatment of SBO. A BE may be useful in cases colonic obstruction (LBO) resulting from sigmoid volvulus, wherein a \"bird's beak\" sign would be seen. Decompression of a sigmoid volvulus may be accomplished with sigmoidoscopy.\n(Choice C) IV fluids would be appropriate to treat intravascular volume depletion associated with SBO, but long intestinal tubes are rarely effective in relieving a SBO, and surgery should not be delayed with attempts to utilize such tubes.\n(Choice E) Because this patient shows signs of small intestinal ischemia due to strangulation, he is at risk for intestinal bacterial translocation and sepsis. Broad spectrum IV antibiotics may be indicated, but the most urgent issue is surgical decompression of the bowel obstruction.\nEducational objective:\nColicky or paroxysmal abdominal pain with episodic hyperactive bowel sounds attributable to peristaltic rushes, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, diffuse abdominal tenderness and obstipation are typical signs of complete small bowel obstruction (SBO). SBO is treated surgically if the obstruction is complete or if signs of strangulation of a bowel loop are present."

        "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency room (ER) because of acute onset left flank pain, hematuria and vomiting. His pain is relieved with ketorolac in the ER. He has a history of abdominal pain due to Crohn disease, but that pain was always in the right lower quadrant and was never this severe. His temperature is 36.8C (98.2F), blood pressure is 120/85 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min and respirations are 16/min. Chest auscultation is clear. Abdomen is soft and mildly tender over the left flank. He has no rebound or rigidity. Bowel sounds are decreased. A laparotomy scar is present in right lower quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",
        "options": [
            "A. Increased recycling of bile salts and fatty acids",
            "B. Increased absorption of oxalate",
            "C. Increased absorption of calcium",
            "D. Increased parathyroid hormone activity",
            "E. Recurrent bacteria infection in the kidney"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The patient described is experiencing symptoms consistent with nephrolithiasis, which classically presents with flank pain and hematuria frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Patients with Crohn disease, or any other small intestinal disorder resulting in fat malabsorption, are predisposed to hyperoxaluria. Oxalate is obtained from the diet and is a normal product of human metabolism. Symptomatic hyperoxaluria is classically the result of increased oxalate absorption in the gut. Under normal circumstances, calcium binds oxalate in the gut and prevents its absorption. In patients with fat malabsorption, calcium is preferentially bound by fat leaving oxalate unbound and free to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Failure to adequately absorb bile salts in states of fat malabsorption also cause decreased bile salt reabsorption in the small intestine. Excess bile salts may damage the colonic mucosa and contribute to increased oxalate absorption.\n(Choice A) Bile salt recycling and fatty acid absorption are decreased in Crohn disease.\n(Choices C and D) Hypercalciuria, which may be idiopathic or may result from hyperparathyroidism, excessive calcium and vitamin D ingestion, dehydration or prolonged immobilization, predisposes to calcium stone formation.\n(Choice E) Recurrent urinary tract infections, particularly by Proteus species, predispose to struvite stone formation. Struvite stones may eventually grow to fill the entire renal pelvis, at which point they are known as \"staghorn” calculi.\nEducational objective:\nOxalate absorption is increased in Crohn disease and all other intestinal diseases causing fat malabsorption. Increased absorption is the most common cause of symptomatic hyperoxaluria and oxalate stone formation."

        "question": "A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of edema of his right ankle. He reports heaviness and cramping in the same leg that is worse after a long day at work. The swelling is usually reduced significantly when he wakes up in the morning and worsens progressively throughout the day. He denies any other symptoms. He has no significant medical problems except hypertension, for which he takes atenolol. His temperature is 36.7C (98F), blood pressure is 120/76 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min and respirations are 16/min. JVP is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. There are no murmurs. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Examination shows edema of the right ankle. Doppler examination of the leg shows no evidence of thrombosis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his edema?",
        "options": [
            "A. Lymphatic obstruction",
            "B. Impaired cardiac contraction",
            "C. Reduced diastolic filling of the heart",

            "E. Venous valve incompetence",
            "F. Decreased liver protein synthesis",
            "G. Arterial occlusion"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The patient described is experiencing unilateral lower extremity edema that worsens when the leg is dependent (i.e. while the patient is at work) and improves with leg elevation (i.e. when the patient is sleeping). There are many potential causes of lower extremity edema. Indeed, all of the above mentioned conditions may cause edema of the legs, but in the clinical scenario provided, venous valvular incompetence is the most likely cause. Venous insufficiency is the most common cause of lower extremity edema; it affects approximately 2% of the population at large. Failure of venous valves allows blood to pool in dependent areas such as the legs resulting in an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure. This increased pressure favors increased filtration of fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitial tissue. This process causes a decrease in intravascular volume, which stimulates the kidneys to retain water and salt ultimately leading to further progression of edema.\n(Choice A) Lymphatic obstruction is an uncommon cause of edema. It may result from malignant obstruction of lymph nodes, lymph node resection, trauma and filariasis. It classically affects the dorsa of the feet and causes marked thickening and rigidity of the skin.\n(Choices B & C) Impaired cardiac contraction and reduced diastolic filling of the heart may cause bilateral lower extremity edema due to pooling of blood in the venous circulation causing increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. However, respiratory symptoms and crackles on examination are common.\n(Choices D & F) Increased urinary loss of protein and decreased liver protein synthesis causes decreased plasma oncotic pressure, which results in decreased reabsorption of interstitial fluid in distal capillaries and edema. Urinary protein loss occurs in nephrotic syndromes as well as in most cases of nephritis. Failure of liver protein synthesis typically occurs in the setting of cirrhosis or other forms of liver failure where the synthetic function of the liver is impaired. Other signs of liver failure and nephrotic syndrome are usually evident.\n(Choice G) Arterial occlusion causes pain, pallor, paresthesias, pulselessness and coolness to the touch in affected extremities.\nEducational objective:\nVenous insufficiency (valvular incompetence) is the most common cause of lower extremity edema. It classically worsens throughout the day and resolves overnight when the patient is recumbent."

        "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe pain in his penis. He was having sex with his wife on top when he had sudden onset severe pain in the penis at the height of orgasm. Swelling of the penis and deviation of the penile shaft to the right followed the pain. Examination shows a man in severe distress. The penis is uncircumcised, grossly swollen and deviated to the right. There is no blood at the urethral meatus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Surgical exploration of penis",
            "B. Retrograde urethrogram followed by surgical exploration of penis",
            "C. Foley's catheterization",
            "D. Antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatory and follow up in 24 hours",
            "E. Do a circumcision"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient exhibits a classic presentation of penile fracture. The penis, due to its mobility in the flaccid state, is typically not injured in cases of blunt trauma. It is far more vulnerable to trauma in its erect state, such as during sexual intercourse, and this is the setting where penile fracture is most commonly encountered. This injury most often occurs during intercourse where the woman is situated on top of the man because the penis may emerge from the vagina in this position and be subsequently injured in a bending fashion between its rigid fixation on the male and the downwardly moving female perineum. Patients typically complain of a snapping sensation and / or sound when the injury occurs followed by severe pain. The injury and associated snapping sensation results from tearing of the tunica albuginea, which invests the corpus cavernosum. A hematoma rapidly forms at the site of injury causing bending of the shaft of the penis at the site of the fracture. Treatment is with an emergent urethrogram to assess for urethral injury as well as emergent surgery to evacuate the hematoma and mend the torn tunica albuginea.\n(Choices A & C) Surgical exploration is the treatment of choice for penile fracture, but it should always be preceded by a retrograde urethrogram to rule out a urethral injury. This is important because an occult urethral injury may be exacerbated by placement of a Foley catheter.\n(Choice D) There is no role for a conservative approach in the treatment of penile fracture; emergent urethral imaging and surgical correction is the only acceptable treatment.\n(Choice E) Circumcision is the treatment of choice for phimosis, paraphimosis and Zoon's balanitis. It is also associated with a lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, but it has no role in the treatment of penile fracture.\nEducational objective:\nPenile fracture is a surgical emergency that requires emergent urethral imaging and surgical repair. The most common cause is a crush injury of the erect penis, most commonly during intercourse where the female is on top of the male."

        "question": "A 30-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of swelling and pain in the right knee. He first experienced pain when he twisted his leg while playing football 15 days ago. He felt something ‘popping’ in the knee at that time but ignored it. The pain and swelling has been increasing since, and he feels sudden pain with extension of his leg. Examination shows the right knee is swollen and tender along the medial side. Full extension of the right knee is not possible due to sudden pain during terminal extension. Snapping can be felt in the right knee on tibial torsion with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. An x-ray film of the knee joint shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": [
            "A. Anterior cruciate ligament injury",
            "B. Posterior cruciate ligament injury",
            "C. Medial meniscus tear",
            "D. Medial collateral ligament tear",
            "E. Lateral collateral ligament tear"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The patient described most likely has suffered a tear of the medial meniscus. Meniscal injuries often result from twisting injuries with the foot fixed. The medial meniscus is more commonly injured than the lateral meniscus. Patients generally complain of a popping sound followed by severe pain at the time of injury. Because the meniscus is not directly perfused, effusion following injury typically is not clinically apparent for many hours following the injury. Examination reveals localized tenderness on the medial side of the knee. Locking of the knee joint on extension is generally seen in \"bucket handle\" tears, while range of motion at the knee is limited by pain in all meniscal tears. McMurray's sign, which is indicative of a medial meniscus tear, refers to a palpable or audible snap occurring while slowly extending the leg at the knee from full flexion while simultaneously applying tibial torsion.\n(Choice A) In cases of anterior cruciate ligament tear, the patient gives a history of a forceful hyperextension injury to knee or a noncontact torsional injury of the knee during deceleration. Effusion is seen rapidly following injury. Lachman's test, anterior drawer test and pivot shift test are used for clinical diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Posterior cruciate ligament injury is classically seen in the \"dashboard injury\", which refers to forceful posterior-directed force on the tibia with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. The posterior drawer, reverse pivot shift and posterior sag tests will help in clinical diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Medial collateral ligament injury is associated with abduction injury to the knee. The valgus stress test will help in clinical diagnosis of this condition.\n(Choice E) Lateral collateral ligament injury is very rare and would be seen in adduction injury to the knee. The varus stress test will help in clinical diagnosis of these patients.\nEducational objective:\nThe medial meniscus is typically injured during forceful torsion of the knee with the foot planted. Patients complain of a popping sound and severe pain at the time of injury; McMurray's sign is commonly positive on physical exam. A bucket handle tear of the medial meniscus leads to locking of the knee joint during terminal extension."

        "question": "A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. He has severe abdominal and left shoulder pain. His temperature is 36.0C (96.8 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min and respirations are 23/min. Examination shows tenderness in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. An x-ray film of the chest shows fractures of the left 7th, 8th and 9th ribs. A CT scan of the abdomen Is suggestive of splenic injury with some free fluid in the abdomen. He has not been vaccinated for H. Influenza or S. pneumoniae. Which of the following is the most important determinant for surgical versus non-surgical management in this patient?",
        "options": [
            "A. Presence of left shoulder pain",
            "B. Presence of free fluid in the abdomen",
            "C. Presence of a rib fracture on chest x-ray",
            "D. Unvaccinated status of the patient",
            "E. Hemodynamic stability and hematocrit values"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The spleen is the most commonly injured organ in cases of blunt abdominal trauma. Patients who have suffered a splenic injury classically complain of left upper quadrant pain; rib fracture may frequently accompany splenic injuries. Pain referred to the left shoulder may result from irritation of the left hemidiaphragm by hemorrhage. Patients who present in obvious hemorrhagic shock should undergo immediate laparotomy and splenectomy, but most patients are managed nonoperatively with close ICU monitoring and fluid resuscitation. Some patients who have a hemorrhage but are otherwise hemodynamically stabilized may be candidates for angiography, which can demonstrate the exact site of hemorrhage and be used to treat the hemorrhage by embolization. If a patient being treated with observation experiences hemodynamic instability unresponsive to a 2L saline bolus or otherwise requires a blood transfusion, then laparotomy is indicated for splenorrhaphy or splenectomy. Following splenectomy, patients are at a greater risk of infections by encapsulated organisms such as H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. Appropriate vaccinations should be administered in all post-splenectomy patients.\n(Choice A) Referred shoulder pain associated with abdominal pathology (Kehr sign) results from irritation of the diaphragm, in this case by the bleeding spleen, which causes referred pain in the dermatomal distribution of the phrenic nerve roots (C3 – C5).\n(Choice B) There is poor correlation between the amount of free fluid in the abdomen and the necessity for surgical intervention.\n(Choice C) Fractured ribs are commonly associated with splenic trauma but are not a determinant of surgical versus non-surgical intervention.\n(Choice D) Though post-splenectomy patients are at a higher risk of infection with capsulated organisms, the unvaccinated status of a patient with splenic trauma does not determine surgical versus non-surgical treatment. In general, splenectomy should be avoided in all patients as the spleen has important immunologic and hematologic functions.\nEducational objective:\nHemodynamic stability and the need for blood transfusion are the determinants that guide surgical versus non-surgical management of patients with splenic trauma."

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is suggestive of acute adrenal insufficiency. Acute onset of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, and hypotension after a stressful event (e.g., surgical procedure) in a patient who is steroid-dependent is typical. A very important clue to the correct diagnosis in this patient is the past medical history (lupus) indicative of preoperative steroid use. Exogenous steroids depress pituitary-adrenal axis and a stressful situation can precipitate an acute adrenal insufficiency.\n(Choice B) Diabetic ketoacidosis is also manifested by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; however, you will see hyperglycemia, and you usually do not see hypotension.\n(Choice C) An abscess is a late postoperative complication.\n(Choice D) Intestinal obstruction is not accompanied by hypoglycemia and hypotension, even though you can see all the rest.\n(Choice F) Severe allergic reaction usually immediately follows the injection of a drug and is frequently accompanied by bronchospasm and urticaria/edema.\n(Choice G) Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is manifested by autonomic activation, but nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain is not the common presentation. Also, hypotension is not typically seen.\n(Choice H) Atelectasis is an early postoperative complication characterized by fever and is much less dramatic in presentation.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute adrenal insufficiency is a potentially lethal postoperative complication. Preoperative steroid use is the main cause. A high index of suspicion is required. Commonly, they present with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, and hypotension."

        "explanation": "This patient has nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), an undifferentiated carcinoma of squamous cell origin seen with higher frequency in people of Mediterranean or Far Eastern descent. These tumors are usually asymptomatic until disease is advanced: most NPC is metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Patients with NPC often present with recurrent otitis media (resulting from eustachian tube obstruction by tumor), recurrent epistaxis, and/or nasal obstruction. Undifferentiated NPC is strongly associated with positive serologies for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The association is so strong that EBV titer levels may be used to track the progress of therapy for this malignancy. This cancer is also associated with smoking and with chronic nitrosamine consumption (as in diets rich in salted fish).\n(Choice A) Chronic alcohol use is a risk factor for alcoholism, alcoholic cirrhosis, aspiration pneumonia, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, depression and liver neoplasms.\n(Choice B) Untreated syphilis will proceed through primary, secondary and tertiary phases.

        "explanation": "Femoral neck fractures are intracapsular fractures and are most commonly seen in postmenopausal females and males over 70 years of age. The patient will classically present following a fall with inability to ambulate and hip pain. On exam, the involved limb is shortened and externally rotated. Active and passive range of motion of the affected limb elicits pain. The diagnosis can be made with AP and lateral X-rays of the hip, and classification of the fracture using the Garden classification system may then be made based on radiographic findings as follows:\nType 1: Valgus impaction of femoral head.\nType 2: Complete but non-displaced femoral neck fracture.\nType 3: Complete fracture with displacement <= 50 %.\nType 4: Complete fracture with displacement >= 50%.\nType 1 or stress fractures can be managed nonoperatively with toe-touch weight bearing on crutches until there is radiological evidence of complete healing. Garden types 2, 3 and 4 are unstable fractures and require open reduction and internal fixation or a primary arthroplasty as soon as the patient is stabilized. Elderly patients and those with severely displaced femoral neck fractures, such as the patient described in the question stem who has a Garden type 4 fracture, are preferentially treated with arthroplasty. Arthroplasty is preferred because the risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head is high, even following open reduction and internal fixation, due to the tenuous blood supply of the femoral head.\n(Choice A) Closed treatment in a spica cast almost always results in nonunion.\n(Choice B) Internal fixation is preferentially used for Garden type 2 or 3 fractures in young patients in an effort to save the femoral head.\n(Choice C) Closed reduction and external fixation is not recommended for displaced femoral neck fractures because the reduction is not satisfactory and there is a high chance of nonunion or avascular necrosis of head of femur.\n(Choice D) Lower limb traction as a means of definitive treatment of fracture of neck of femur is associated with prolonged immobilization and significant morbidity associated with immobilization.\nEducational Objective:\nElderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures should be treated with primary arthroplasty."

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This patient is experiencing acute compartment syndrome secondary to supracondylar fracture of humerus. Supracondylar fracture of humerus is common in young children and adolescents secondary to fall on an outstretched hand. Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure within a limited anatomic space, acutely compromising the circulation and ultimately threatening the function of the tissue within that space. Diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made predominantly on clinical findings of pain, pallor, pulselessness, paralysis and paresthesia. Treatment consists of immediate fasciotomy.\nVolkmann's ischemic contracture is the final sequel of compartment syndrome in which the dead muscle has been replaced with fibrous tissue (Choice E).\n(Choice A) Malunion with alteration of carrying angle is another common complication of supracondylar fracture of humerus; however it is not a sequel of compartment syndrome.\n(Choice B) Non-union is not a common complication of supracondylar fracture of humerus and does not occur as a sequel of acute compartment syndrome.\n(Choice C and D) Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is a vague painful condition seen as a sequel of infection or trauma which may be minor. It is characterized by pain, hyperesthesia and tenderness, which are out of proportion to the physical findings. It does not have an acute onset like in this patient and is not associated with compartment syndrome. Sudeck's atrophy is a radiographic term for spotty rarefaction seen in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy.\nEducational objective:\nVolkmann's ischemic contracture is the final sequel of compartment syndrome in which the dead muscle has been replaced with fibrous tissue."

He has had type I diabetes mellitus for 10 years and is on insulin. His temperature is 38.3C (101.9F). Examination shows multiple furuncles on the inner side of both thighs; most of them are in regression. Abdominal examination shows tenderness on deep palpation in RLQ without rebound or guarding; no masses are palpated; psoas sign is positive; bowel sounds are present. Rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.0 g/L\nLeukocyte count 17,500/mm3\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Appendectomy",

            "E. AP and lateral lumbar films"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The patient described most likely has a psoas abscess resulting from hematogenous spread of bacteria from his many furuncles. He has no guarding, rigidity or rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant making the diagnosis of appendicitis unlikely. In acute appendicitis, patients initially have vague periumbilical pain that subsequently localizes to right lower quadrant. Patients with a psoas abscess typically present with fever and lower abdominal or back pain. Deep abdominal palpation is required to elicit tenderness due to the deep location of the psoas on the posterior abdominal wall. As with any infectious process, leukocytosis is evident on laboratory tests. A CT scan is required to confirm the diagnosis. A psoas abscess may also result from contiguous spread from nearby bone or bowel.\n(Choice A) As discussed, the clinical scenario is not consistent with appendicitis. An appendectomy in this situation would not benefit the patient.\n(Choice B) If the clinical suspicion of psoas abscess is high and CT is negative, exploratory laparoscopy may be indicated to identify the primary pathology. Patients with psoas abscess are treated with drainage and systemic antibiotics. Drainage may be accomplished without laparotomy or laparoscopy by placement of a percutaneous drainage tube.\n(Choice D) Colonoscopy may be beneficial if the primary pathology is felt to be in the colon. Examples of colonic diseases that cause lower abdominal pain are diverticulitis, Crohn disease, perforating carcinoma of the cecum and yersiniosis.\n(Choice E) AP and lateral lumbar films may be useful in making the diagnosis of ureteral stones (if radioopaque), bowel obstruction and perforated abdominal viscus. A lumbar x-ray may also disclose the destruction of the vertebral bodies caused by spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease). Potts disease is a rare cause of psoas abscess resulting from contiguous spread.\nEducational Objective:\nCT scan is the investigation of choice to diagnose an intraabdominal abscess. Musculoskeletal infections, such as osteomyelitis or abscess, frequently result from hematogenous spread of organisms from another site, such as the skin. In such cases, S. aureus is the most common offending pathogen."

            "E. Resuscitate and re-evaluate"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The patient in this vignette has a pulsatile abdominal mass and is hypotensive. This patient has a diagnosis of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) unless proven otherwise. Ruptured AAAs can present in numerous ways, mimicking various abdominal pathology. The classic presentation is with sudden-onset back pain that may be followed by syncope. When hypotension is present with a pulsatile mass, no further studies are indicated. The patient should be immediately taken to the operating room for an emergent laparotomy for repair of the aneurysm. Mortality with this condition is approximately 50%; early recognition and operative intervention are essential.\n(Choice A) Fast track ultrasound is a newer modality used in trauma. It can make a diagnosis of free abdominal fluid but cannot decipher the origin of the fluid or the damaged organ. It can detect an abdominal aneurysm and is the tool classically used to screen for and monitor AAAs.\n(Choices B and C) Laparotomy should not be delayed for any other studies or interventions in cases of ruptured AAA. Both of these studies are very time consuming and expose the patient to intravenous contrast, an intervention that itself is not without risk.\n(Choice E) Resuscitation can be done while the patient is being prepared for surgery. In cases of ruptured AAA as in trauma, aggressive resuscitation can cause increased hemorrhage. The goal of resuscitation should be to maintain mentation and end organ perfusion without hypertension.\nEducational objective:\nWhen a patient presents with a pulsatile abdominal mass and hypotension, a presumptive diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm must be entertained and the patient should be taken immediately to the operating room."

There is a bruise over the right forehead, but no tenderness is present on palpation of the cranial bones. Examination of the right leg reveals a hematoma over the thigh. Knee extension on the right is markedly reduced when compared to the left. Sensory examination reveals decreased sensory perception to both sharp and dull stimuli over the right lower medial leg.

            "E. Fibular nerve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This question requires that you recall the neuroanatomy of the lower limb. This patient has a femoral nerve injury. The femoral nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh (i.e., quadriceps femoris, sartorius, pectineus), and is therefore responsible for knee extension and hip flexion. It provides sensation to the anterior thigh and medial leg via the saphenous branch.\n(Choice B) The tibial nerve supplies the muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh, posterior compartment of the leg, and plantar muscles of the foot. These muscles control flexion of the knee and digits, and plantar flexion of the foot. The tibial nerve provides sensation to the leg (except medial side) and plantar foot.\n(Choice C) The obturator nerve innervates the medial compartment of the thigh (i.e., gracilis adductor longus, adductor brevis, anterior portion of adductor magnus), and controls adduction of the thigh. It provides sensation over the medial thigh.\n(Choice D) The common peroneal nerve gives rise to the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. These two nerves supply the muscles of the anterior and lateral leg. These nerves provide sensation to the anterolateral leg and dorsum of the foot.\n(Choice E) The fibular nerve is another name for the common peroneal nerve.\nEducational Objective:\nFamiliarize yourself with the basic neuroanatomy of the upper and lower limbs. The femoral nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh, and is therefore responsible for knee extension and hip flexion. The femoral nerve provides sensation to the anterior thigh and medial leg via the saphenous branch."

            "E. Closed intramedullary fixation of the femoral shaft"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Femoral shaft fractures are generally seen after severe direct trauma. Patients suffering traumatic fractures of the femoral shaft frequently present with signs of shock as a significant amount of blood can be lost into the thigh. On examination, the thigh is often deformed and ecchymotic. The preferred management for femoral shaft fractures is closed intramedullary fixation of shaft with medullary reaming and intramedullary nailing. This allows for early mobilization, improved knee and hip function during recovery and decreased hospital cost. In this technique, closed reduction of fracture segment is followed by intramedullary nail insertion through small skin insertion over the greater trochanter.\n(Choice A) Closed intramedullary nailing is preferred over open nailing in closed femoral shaft fractures as it is associated with a lower risk of infection, less soft tissue disruption and a lower risk of nonunion.\n(Choice B) External fixation is indicated in certain cases of open fracture where contamination of the wound is significant and the placement of indwelling hardware is contraindicated or when there is significant soft tissue loss around the fracture.\n(Choice C) Plaster casting is inappropriate for femoral shaft fractures because there is no traction to maintain femoral length and rotational position and weight bearing would be delayed for a prolonged period of time thereby increasing morbidity.\n(Choice D) Plate and screw fixation is reserved only for patients who can not be treated with intramedullary nailing, such as victims of polytrauma who are unable to be placed on the fracture table.\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment of choice for fractures of the femoral shaft is closed intramedullary fixation of fracture."

            "E. Surgical tracheostomy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In managing the patient with trauma first priority should be to establish an airway followed by securing breathing and circulation (ABC of resuscitation). In a totally apneic patient like this, an appropriate airway should be restored as soon as possible.\nOrotracheal intubation is the best way to restore airway in this patient. A facemask is not a mean to establish an airway. An orotracheal intubation needs hyperextension of neck and should be done only after a cervical spine injury is ruled out or in case of apneic patient. Though this patient is apneic and is also at risk of having a cervical injury the benefits of orotracheal intubation outweighs the risk and so an orotracheal intubation should be done with care not to move the head. Another option would be to do a surgical cricothyroidectomy.\n(Choice A) Nasotracheal intubation is a blind procedure and it is necessary that patient should have a spontaneous breathing. Thus it is contraindicated in apneic patients.\n(Choice C) Needle cricothyroidectomy is an excellent field procedure to establish an airway especially in children. However, it is not suitable in adults due to risk of carbon dioxide retention especially in patients with head injury where hyperventilation can be required to prevent or treat intracranial hypertension.\n(Choice D) Intubation over a fiberoptic bronchoscope although very effective cannot be performed so rapidly to meet the needs of an apneic patient.\n(Choice E) Tracheostomy is no longer a first option to establish an airway because of its complications. A surgical cricothyroidectomy is always preferred over surgical tracheostomy, however a cricothyroidectomy should be converted to formal tracheostomy in 5-7 days if prolonged airway control is needed as cricothyroidectomy has high incidence of tracheal stenosis with prolonged use.\nEducational Objective:\nOrotracheal intubation and surgical cricothyroidectomy are preferred way to establish an airway in apneic patient with head injury."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acute blood loss is an indication for transfusion in patients who have lost 25-30% of their blood volume (1500mL in 70 kg man). Crystalloid resuscitation is generally adequate for blood loss that is less than 25% of the patient's blood volume though patients with concomitant heart disease and other comorbidities may require transfusion with lesser blood losses. An effective general guideline for treating a bleeding patient is to initially resuscitate with crystalloids. 2L are administered very quickly. If the patient continues to show signs of hemodynamic instability after infusion of 2L of crystalloid, blood transfusion should be initiated.\n(Choice A) The hematocrit is not a good indicator in acute blood loss because acute blood loss results in a proportional loss of both erythrocytes and plasma. Acutely, physiologic responses to depletion of intravascular volume, such as increased renal retention of water, have not had an opportunity to dilute the blood and cause a drop in hematocrit.\n(Choice C) Hypoxia in a trauma patient could be due to pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary contusion etc. Hypoxia alone is not an indication for blood transfusion.\n(Choices D and F) Acidosis in trauma patients is most likely due to inadequate tissue perfusion. This could be from any reason and need not be from blood loss. For example cardiac tamponade or pneumothorax can cause hypotension and resultant lactic acidosis. Decreased urine output is the result of inadequate renal perfusion, which may be corrected in many patients with crystalloids alone.\n(Choice E) Even though a femoral fracture may be associated with a potential hemorrhage, the presence of a fracture alone is not an indication for blood transfusion.\nEducational Objective:\nAn acute blood loss in excess of 1500 ml usually requires a blood transfusion. The hematocrit is a poor indicator of acute blood loss as it generally remains near the normal level in the time period immediately following hemorrhage."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is consistent with a femoral artery aneurysm. A pulsatile groin mass below the inguinal ligament is characteristic; anterior thigh pain is due to the compression of the femoral nerve that runs lateral to the artery. Femoral artery aneurysm is the second most common peripheral artery aneurysm after popliteal aneurysm. It may be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n(Choice E) Femoral hernias are located below the inguinal ligament, but are not pulsatile.\n(Choices C and D) Inguinal hernias are located above the inguinal ligament; an indirect hernia may descend into the scrotum.\n(Choice A) Femoral vein dilatation usually results from AV fistula (typically traumatic); venous hypertension usually results.\nEducational Objective:\nPeripheral artery aneurysm manifests as a pulsatile mass that can compress adjacent structures (nerves, veins), and can result in thrombosis and ischemia.

            "E. Chest x-ray confirmation of catheter tip location after placement"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Complications from central venous catheter (CVC) placement occur in 1-5% of cases and include arterial puncture, pneumothorax, hemothorax, thrombosis, air embolism, sepsis, vascular perforation and myocardial perforation leading to tamponade. Thus radiographic confirmation of the position of the catheter tip is required following CVC insertion. To avoid myocardial perforation, the catheter tip should be located proximal to the cardiac silhouette or proximal to the angle between the trachea and the right mainstem bronchus. Ideally, the catheter tip should lie in the superior vena cava; tip placement in smaller veins like the subclavian, jugular, azygous or internal mammary predisposes to vascular perforation. Chest x-ray is also required to ensure the absence of iatrogenic pneumothorax and hemothorax.\n(Choice A) CVC insertion via the jugular vein carries similar risks for pneumothorax and myocardial perforation as the subclavian approach. The femoral approach is less likely to cause pneumothorax but is significantly more prone to infection.\n(Choice B) There is no value to monitoring cardiac electrical activity during CVC insertion.\n(Choice C) Aspiration of blood assures only that the tip of the catheter is within the vasculature. It does not determine the location of the catheter tip or negate the risk of pneumothorax.\n(Choice D) Cardiac ultrasound can detect fluid in the pericardium but cannot precisely determine the placement of the CVC catheter tip or the presence of pneumothorax.\nEducational objective:\nA chest x-ray is required following central line placement to ensure proper positioning and absence of pneumothorax."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Bowel ischemia is one known complication (1-7% incidence) of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. It results from inadequate colonic collateral arterial perfusion to the left and sigmoid colon after loss of the inferior mesenteric artery during aortic graft placement. Patients present with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Fever and leukocytosis may also be present. This adverse effect can be minimized by checking sigmoid colon perfusion following placement of the aortic graft.\n(Choice A) C. difficile is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Pseudomembranous colitis occurs following antibiotic treatment and most commonly causes a voluminous watery diarrhea in addition to abdominal pain and fever. Bloody diarrhea is rare. Also, it is uncommon to develop C. difficile infection so early after the antibiotic use (typically takes 4-5 days).\n(Choice B) Invasive diarrhea, such as that caused by E. coli (EIEC) or Shigella, manifests with bloody, purulent diarrhea and tenesmus. These are less likely in this setting.\n(Choice C) Aortoenteric fistula is a rare and late complication where the duodenum erodes into the proximal part of the aortic graft.\n(Choice E) Iatrogenic bowel perforation may be suspected after any abdominal operation.

        "question": "A 35-year-old previously healthy male comes to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of severe abdominal pain. The pain had initially started in the periumbilical area but has now shifted to the right lower quadrant. He also felt nauseated and vomited twice. He has had no previous surgeries. His temperature is 38.9C (102F), blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min and respirations are 20/min. Examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Palpation of the left lower quadrant produces pain in the right lower quadrant. Urinalysis is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Ultrasound of the abdomen",
            "B. CT scan of the abdomen",
            "C. Conservative management",
            "D. Immediate surgery",
            "E. Colonoscopy"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This patient has classic signs and symptoms of appendicitis. The pain of appendicitis typically begins as dull, vague periumbilical pain consistent with midgut visceral pain due to stretching of the appendiceal wall. As inflammation of the peritoneum in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) ensues, the pain localizes to that region and becomes sharp in quality. At this time pain is elicited upon palpation of McBurney's point in the RLQ, and RLQ pain can be reproduced upon deep palpation of the left lower quadrant (Rovsing's sign). Appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis. Patients with a classic presentation of appendicitis should be operated on immediately to remove the inflamed appendix and prevent appendiceal rupture.\n(Choice A) Ultrasound of the abdomen when appendicitis is suspected is utilized in women in whom other pathology, such as an ovarian process, may be the cause of disease. Ultrasound is also used in patients who are pregnant.\n(Choice B) CT scan of the abdomen is used in nonpregnant patients to confirm the diagnosis if the presentation is atypical.\n(Choice C) Conservative management with delayed appendectomy is employed in patients in whom an abscess or phlegmon has occurred. The focus of infection is treated with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest is employed. The appendix is ultimately removed weeks later.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis. Patients with a classic presentation should be operated on immediately to remove the inflamed appendix and prevent appendiceal rupture."

        "question": "A 22-year-old man involved in a motor vehicle collision undergoes a prolonged operation to repair a left femur fracture and femoral artery injury. During the first night after surgery he has pain in the left leg. Despite adequate narcotics, his pain is unremitting; the pain is worse with passive leg movement. Examination shows a pale and swollen leg that is tender to the touch; pulses are palpable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Increase the dose of narcotics",
            "B. Elevate the leg and place ice packs",
            "C. Get an x-ray to make sure the femur fracture is not displaced",
            "D. Go back to the operating room"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Compartment syndrome may be caused by direct trauma (hemorrhage), prolonged compression of an extremity or after revascularization of an acutely ischemic limb. Muscles of the extremity are encased in fascial compartments that do not allow for expansion of tissue. Blood flow at the capillary level relies on the pressure difference between the arterial and venous systems. Hemorrhage or edema within muscle causes increased pressure within the non-distensible fascial compartment. This increased pressure interferes with perfusion by disallowing passage of blood from the arterial system into the capillary beds of the affected muscles. This eventually leads to muscle necrosis. Patients with compartment syndrome classically complain of severe pain that is worsened on passive range of motion, paresthesias, pallor and paresis of the affected limb. Pressure in the compartments can be measured directly using a needle and pressure transducing catheter system. Pressures over 30 mmHg may result in cessation of blood flow through the capillaries and should be treated emergently by fasciotomy.\n(Choice A) Increasing the dose of narcotics can be disastrous if compartment syndrome is not first ruled out.\n(Choice B) If compartment syndrome has been ruled out and the leg swelling is due to edema, then elevation and ice may be a good choice. After compartment syndrome is relieved by fasciotomy, the leg is always elevated as well.\n(Choice C) Displacement of the femur fracture would not cause severe pain unresponsive to narcotics or pallor. Compartment syndrome is the most acute cause of the patient's symptoms and should be addressed and ruled out first. An x-ray is not diagnostic of compartment syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with compartment syndrome complain of severe pain, pain with passive range of motion, paresthesias as well as pallor and paresis of the affected limb. The presence of pulses does not rule out compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy is the treatment and must be done urgently."

        "question": "A 51-year-old male with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis presented to the hospital because of sudden onset severe retrosternal and upper abdominal pain. He has been vomiting for the past few hours after consuming alcohol. His temperature is 38.1C (100.9F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min and respirations are 30/min. Examination shows palpable crepitus in the suprasternal notch. Lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is tender to palpation mostly in the epigastrium. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his current condition?",
        "options": [
            "A. Spontaneous pneumothorax",
            "B. Acute pancreatitis",
            "C. Perforated duodenal ulcer",
            "D. Esophageal perforation",
            "E. Mallory-Weiss tear",
            "F. Acute myocardial infarction"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The constellation of clinical findings in this patient is most consistent with esophageal perforation. First, the patient has chronic pancreatitis resulting from alcohol abuse. Exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis are frequently precipitated by alcohol consumption; such patients should be admonished to never consume alcohol. Exacerbation of the chronic pancreatitis has caused epigastric pain and tenderness as well as vomiting. Spontaneous rupture of the esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome) can occur during episodes of vomiting, particularly when the patient is resisting the vomiting reflex. This results because high intraabdominal pressures are transmitted into the mediastinal esophagus where the transmural difference in pressure is large due to negative intrathoracic pressure. Esophageal rupture in this setting typically occurs a few centimeters above the gastroesophageal junction. The retrosternal pain and crepitus in the suprasternal notch are the result of pneumomediastinum, which commonly occurs following rupture of the esophagus within the mediastinum.\n(Choice A) Pneumomediastinum may accompany a pneumothorax, but pneumothorax would have decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side.\n(Choice B) Acute pancreatitis causes epigastric pain radiating to the back but would not directly result in pneumomediastinum. It may, however, cause a left pleural effusion.\n(Choice C) A perforated duodenal ulcer would cause epigastric pain, and air would be visualized under the diaphragm on upright abdominal X-ray, but pneumomediastinum is not associated with duodenal perforation.\n(Choice E) A Mallory-Weiss tear is an incomplete mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction usually resulting from protracted vomiting. The common presentation is self-limited hematemesis. Pneumomediastinum does not occur in such tears because the rupture is incomplete.\n(Choice F) Myocardial infarction presents with crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and arm typically in a patient with risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and a positive family history of coronary artery disease.\nEducational Objective:\nEsophageal rupture most commonly occurs following instrumentation of the esophagus. Less commonly it may occur in patients with protracted vomiting who have been resisting the urge to vomit. Rupture in these cases typically occurs into the mediastinum resulting in pneumomediastinum."

        "question": "A 12-year-old male is brought to the physician because of a two week history of right groin pain and limping. He is at the 60th percentile for height and the 80th percentile for weight. He is afebrile and his other vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows the range of motion of the right knee joint is within normal limits, but hip movements are restricted and the right foot points medially. There is marked external rotation of the right thigh on flexion of the hip. After confirming the diagnosis, which of the following is the most appropriate management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Aspiration and microscopic examination of the hip joint synovial fluid",
            "B. Conservative management with rest and analgesics",
            "C. Closed reduction of the hip joint",
            "D. Immediate osteotomy of the femoral neck",
            "E. External fixation of the hip joint with pins"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This adolescent has a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). SCFE is characterized by displacement of femoral head on the femoral neck due to disruption of the proximal femoral growth plate. This condition is commonly seen in obese adolescent boys. The physis, the physical junction between the femoral head and neck, weakens during early adolescence because it is rapidly expanding and composed primarily of cartilage, which does not possess the strength of bone. When exposed to excessive shear stress, which is magnified by obesity, the physis fractures and the femoral head slips posteriorly and medially relative to the femoral neck. Patients typically present with hip or knee pain of insidious onset causing limping. Acute presentations may occur. Diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion because knee pain, not hip pain, is a common presenting complaint with this condition. Physical examination shows loss of abduction and internal rotation of the hip, and patients hold the thigh in external rotation while the hip is being flexed. A frog-leg lateral view x-ray of the hip is the diagnostic imaging technique of choice. SCFE should be treated promptly with surgical pinning of the slipped epiphysis where it lays (in situ) in order to lessen the risk of avascular necrosis of femoral head and chondrolysis.\n(Choice A) Joint aspiration and microscopic analysis would be useful in the diagnosis of a septic joint or a crystal-induced arthropathy.\n(Choice B) Conservative management with rest and analgesics is indicated for the treatment of tendinous or ligamentous strains.\n(Choice C) Closed reduction is not advised due to the risk of further damage to the tenuous blood supply of femoral head, which may lead to avascular necrosis.\n(Choice D) Corrective osteotomies may cause avascular necrosis and may not correct the exact anatomic deformity. They are usually undertaken later in treatment if a patient experiences persistent pain and limitation of range of motion after initial repairs and attempted rehabilitation.\nEducational objective:\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) typically occurs in obese early adolescent males. Acute SCFE is an emergency condition and should be promptly corrected with external screws in order to prevent avascular necrosis of the femoral head and chondrolysis."

        "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician's office because of breast pain. She has a 2-month-old baby who she breastfeeds. Her temperature is 38.8C (101.9F). Examination shows a hard, red, tender and swollen area on her right breast. There is no fluctuance noted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Incision and drainage",
            "B. Recommend mammogram",
            "C. Antibiotics and lactation suppression with bromocriptine",
            "D. Antibiotics, analgesics and continue breast feeding",
            "E. Antibiotics, analgesics and nursing only from unaffected breast"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The patient described has mastitis associated with nursing. Typically mastitis in this setting results from transmission of a bacterial organism from the infant's nasopharynx to a fissure on the mother's nipple or areola. The most commonly isolated organism is S. aureus. Treatment is with analgesics, antibiotics and continued nursing. The most commonly used antibiotics are dicloxacillin or cephalosporins. Continued nursing from the affected breast has been shown to decrease the progression of mastitis to breast abscess and should be recommended in all cases.\n(Choice A) Incision and drainage would be indicated for an abscess, but no fluctuance was noted on exam so an abscess is unlikely.\n(Choice B) Mammogram before the age of 35 is generally not helpful because the breast tissue is dense. Additionally, the clinical scenario is much more consistent with mastitis than breast malignancy.\n(Choices C and E) Suppression or discontinuation of lactation is not recommended in mastitis. Continued drainage of milk from the affected breast has been shown to cause resolution of a proportion of cases of mastitis as a sole intervention.\nEducational Objective:\nMastitis associated with breast-feeding is treated with analgesics, antibiotics and continuation of breast feeding from the affected breast."

        "question": "A 23-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a painful swollen left knee. The pain began after he twisted his leg while playing football. Examination shows a swollen left knee with marked tenderness of the medial side of the knee. When compared to the right knee, on valgus stressing the left knee shows exaggerated laxity at the joint line. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis?",
        "options": [
            "A. CT scan of the knee joint",
            "B. Joint fluid aspiration",
            "C. Arthroscopy",
            "D. MRI of the knee joint",
            "E. Plain radiographs of the knee joint"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This patient has an injury to medial collateral ligament of the knee. The medial collateral ligament is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee. Forceful abduction of the knee, often with a torsional component of motion causes most injuries to this ligament. On examination, the knee joint is swollen due to effusion with tenderness over medial aspect of the knee. Because the medial collateral ligament resists valgus angulations (abduction) at the knee, injury to this ligament leads to increased angulation of the effected knee on valgus stress. MRI is the investigation of choice for assessment of soft tissue injuries of the knee. MRI is able to detect complete and partial tears, the exact site of ligamentous injury and associated injuries to other ligaments or the meniscus.\n(Choice A) CT scan does not visualize the soft tissue of the knee joint (tendons, ligaments, meniscus) as well as MRI.\n(Choice B) Swelling in this patient is due to effusion associated with ligamentous injury: fluid examination is not needed. Joint aspiration is useful in the diagnosis of septic arthritis and crystal-induced arthritis.\n(Choice C) Arthroscopy is an invasive procedure and is reserved for cases where MRI is inconclusive or surgical treatment of lesion is necessary.\n(Choice E) Plain radiographs are of limited use in confirming the diagnosis of ligamentous injury though they should be obtained for all patients with traumatic knee injury.\nEducational Objective:\nMRI is the investigation of choice for defining soft tissue injuries of the knee. Surgery is rarely necessary for MCL tears, bracing and early ambulation is the preferred treatment."

            "E. Perform lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This patient initially was admitted for acute pancreatitis. The patient is usually afebrile in uncomplicated pancreatitis. Alcohol abuse and gallstones account for over 80% of cases of pancreatitis; this patient likely abuses alcohol given his social history, his elevated MCV and his withdrawal-like tremulousness and formication. A well-known complication of acute pancreatitis is pseudocyst formation. Pancreatic pseudocysts are defined as collections of pancreatic secretions within a fibrous capsule, usually within the pancreas. Pseudocysts are typically diagnosed when a patient with acute pancreatitis fails to improve clinically with standard supportive care. Pseudocysts may uncommonly become infected resulting in a pancreatic abscess. Pancreatic abscess is typically accompanied by fever and leukocytosis and may result in bacteremia, as described in this patient. Treatment includes antibiotics and drainage of the abscess.\n(Choice B) Conservative management is indicated for uncomplicated pseudocysts. Pseudocysts may be complicated by infection, rupture or hemorrhage; these complications require intervention.\n(Choice C) Infective endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser most commonly results from S. aureus colonization of the right heart valves. This is not the most likely cause of this patient's bacteremia, so an echocardiogram is not indicated at this time.\n(Choice D) Pancreatic cancer is not a likely cause of the patient's acute issues. CA 19-9 levels are not indicated in the acute management of this patient.\n(Choice E) His disorientation, tremor and hallucinations are probably due to alcohol withdrawal. There is no need for lumbar puncture at this time.\nEducational Objective:\nA cystic lesion involving the pancreas on CT scan in the setting of acute pancreatitis with systemic toxicity must be considered an abscess and should be treated with drainage. In the absence of systemic toxicity, a pseudocyst may be presumed and managed expectantly."

On examination, the child is irritable. Second-degree burns are noted on the buttocks, genitalia, waist, proximal thighs and feet. There is an abrupt demarcation between the burned and unaffected skin. A faint yellow patch of discoloration is noted on the left thorax with a slight violaceous hue. The child has not yet had his 1-year vaccinations. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

            "D. Ask the mother if the child is being abused",
            "E. Advise the mother of the suspected abuse, but do not notify authorities because this is a violation of patient confidentiality"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Over 1% of children in the United States are victims of child maltreatment, which can take on many forms including physical or sexual abuse, psychological abuse, neglect or Munchausen disease by proxy. Most cases of child abuse that present for medical evaluation will enter the medical system via the emergency department. Emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for abuse. To reinforce the need for reporting, many local authorities have implemented policies including fines or imprisonment for failing to report suspected abuse to child protective services. Factors that may indicate child abuse include but are not limited to the following:\n1. Patterned scalds and burns indicative of forceful immersion or the use of a hot object such as a cigarette or curling iron\n2. Incoherent or improbable explanation of the injuries\n3. Delay in seeking care after the injury\n4. Fractures of the long bones or ribs, fractures in various stages of healing\n5. Bruising on areas other than those overlying bony prominences\n6. Suspicious bruises include those on the thighs, abdomen, cheeks and genitalia\n7. Patterned bruising such as loops from a cord or belt or imprints of a hand\n8. Subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages in very young infants\n9. Inappropriate affect of the caregiver\nIn any case of suspected child abuse, the physician should do the following:\n1. Perform a thorough physical examination and obtain a radiographic skeletal survey in order to identify and document any signs of abuse.\n2. Report the case to child protective services\n3. Admit the patient to ensure their safety\nIn the case described, the wounds are most consistent with an intentional immersion burn. These burns classically show a sharp demarcation between the burned and unburned skin and sparing of the bilateral gluteal regions because these are typically firmly pressed against the bottom of the tub thereby preventing burning. Additionally, the mother's story is inconsistent with the injuries and she has delayed seeking medical care for 2 days.\n(Choices A & C) The child should never be sent home in cases of suspected child abuse. It is mandatory to report the case to child protective services and hold the patient in the hospital. Maintaining the water temperature below 140 F helps prevents scalds in most of the cases.\n(Choice D) The caregiver should never be confronted in case of suspected child abuse. They should simply be informed that abuse is suspected and will be investigated by the appropriate authorities. Accusations should not be made by the physician.\n(Choice E) Physicians are mandatory reporters for suspected child abuse or domestic abuse. It is illegal to not report such incidents.\nEducational objective:\nIn cases of suspected child abuse, physicians are required to thoroughly examine the child for documentation of all potential signs of abuse. This includes a complete skeletal survey. Child protective services should be notified of all suspected cases immediately, and the patient should be admitted."

        "question": "A 53-year-old male comes to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset intense, stabbing epigastric pain. He also vomited once and a dull, aching pain then spread through his entire abdomen. He has had nonspecific epigastric pain for several months and saw a physician one month ago. He also has a history of constipation, type II diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 26 years. He drinks 4 oz of alcohol daily. His temperature is 38.3C (100.4F), blood pressure is 160/95 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min and respirations are 26/min. The entire abdomen is tender to palpation with rebound, but there is no guarding.

            "F. Biliary colic"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The above upright radiograph shows free air under the diaphragm, a sign of perforation of an abdominal viscus. His presentation complaining of \"sudden\" onset abdominal pain also indicated perforation. The patient's history of chronic epigastric pain is most likely due to peptic ulcer disease, and given this, the diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer is most likely. The patient's diffuse abdominal pain is the result of a chemical peritonitis due to the release of gastric secretions into the peritoneum.\n(Choices A and F) Cholecystitis and biliary colic would not cause free air under the diaphragm though emphysematous cholecystitis may be associated with pneumobilia. Cholecystitis is associated with a positive Murphy's sign, but this physical exam maneuver is not specific. Additionally, the presence of gallstones on ultrasound does not necessarily indicate cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis, as asymptomatic gallstones are very common.\n(Choices B and C) Pancreatitis would not cause free air under the diaphragm. Additionally, pancreatitis is classically associated with dull, \"boring\" epigastric pain that radiates to the midback.\n(Choice E) Any perforated viscus can give free air. Diverticulitis usually starts with left lower quadrant pain and usually does not have the dramatic presentation with sudden abdominal pain.\nEducational Objective:\nPerforated peptic ulcer causes sudden onset severe epigastric pain, which spreads over the whole abdomen due to chemical peritonitis. Upright abdominal x-rays classically show free air under the diaphragm."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Respiration and hemodynamics may be altered after repair of large hernias. This results from the increased pressure within the abdominal cavity that results from replacement of the large hernia contents into the peritoneal cavity. The increased intraabdominal pressure impairs inferior motion of the diaphragm thereby causing hypoventilation. Anesthetics and postoperative pain control measures (narcotics) can also impair ventilation. Venous return to the heart is also decreased due to increased intraabdominal pressure; this may result in hypotension if severe. The arterial blood gas values in this patient are consistent with hypoventilation (slightly decreased pH, increased pCO2, hypoxemia). Early physiotherapy and respiratory exercises (blowing against resistance) are indicated to prevent atelectasis, mucous plugging and pneumonia.\n(Choice B) Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated for nosocomial pneumonia, which is unlikely on the first post-operative day.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary embolism would result in hypoxia accompanied by hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis due to the compensatory hyperventilation.\n(Choice D) Bronchial obstruction (asthma, COPD) would produce similar arterial blood gas changes (respiratory acidosis), but in such cases, auscultatory findings such as wheezing and prolonged expiration would be present.\n(Choice E) This clinical scenario is not consistent with myocardial infarction, which is unlikely in a 40 year old with no known risk factors.\nEducational Objective:\nHypoventilation is a frequent occurrence after abdominal hernia repair and early physiotherapy and respiratory exercises are indicated to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The differential diagnosis for unilateral hip pain in a middle-aged adult is broad, and includes infection, trauma, arthritis, bursitis, and radiculopathy. This particular patient's presentation is most consistent with trochanteric bursitis. Trochanteric bursitis is inflammation of the bursa surrounding the insertion of the gluteus medius onto the femur's greater trochanter. Excessive frictional forces secondary to overuse, trauma, joint crystals, or infection are responsible. Patients with this condition complain of hip pain when pressure is applied (as when sleeping) and with external rotation or resisted abduction.\n(Choice A) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a condition that primarily affects obese male children during late childhood or early adolescence.\n(Choice B) In Paget's disease of the bone (osteitis deformans), bone turnover is accelerated in localized areas resulting in focal bony hypertrophy. Affected bone is weak and prone to pathologic fractures. This condition tends to affect elderly patients and is asymptomatic in up to 75% of cases.\n(Choice C) Aortoiliac peripheral vascular disease may cause buttock, thigh, or hip pain and claudication. In men it may also cause erectile dysfunction (Leriche syndrome). The pain in this condition is exercise-induced and relieved by rest.\n(Choice E) Hip osteoarthritis causes pain localized deep within the joint (in contrast to the superficial tenderness here) that may be referred to the inguinal area or rarely to the knee. Hip osteoarthritis is uncommon before the age of 50. Classically, internal rotation of the hip worsens this pain.\n(Choice F) The femoral nerve provides sensation to the hip joint and to the skin of the anterior and medial thigh and leg. Thus, neuropathy of the femoral nerve would not cause superficial pain over the lateral hip. Superficial pain referred to the upper lateral thigh would likely be transmitted by the lateral femoral cutaneous and/or iliohypogastric nerves.\nEducational objective:\nIn a middle-aged adult, superficial unilateral hip pain that is exacerbated by external pressure to the upper lateral thigh (as when lying on the affected side in bed) suggests trochanteric bursitis."

        "question": "A 12-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after direct blunt trauma to the upper abdomen. He has epigastric pain and repeated vomiting immediately after the trauma. He is afebrile and his other vital signs are stable. Barium examination shows duodenal obstruction. CT scan of the abdomen shows a duodenal hematoma and no other injuries are noted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Exploratory laparotomy",
            "B. Nasogastric suction with parenteral nutrition",
            "C. Bowel rest and antibiotics",
            "D. Endoscopic removal of the hematoma",
            "E. MRI of the abdomen"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Duodenal hematomas most commonly occur following direct blunt abdominal trauma and are more commonly seen in children. Following trauma, blood collects between the submucosal and muscular layers of the duodenum causing obstruction. Patients classically present with epigastric pain and vomiting due to the failure to pass gastric secretions past the obstructing hematoma. Most hematomas will resolve spontaneously in 1-2 weeks, and the intervention of choice is nasogastric suction and parenteral nutrition. Surgery may be considered to evacuate the hematoma if this more conservative method fails.\n(Choice A) Exploratory laparotomy is indicated only if there are other intraabdominal injuries following trauma such as hemorrhage or bowel perforation. Duodenal hematoma is best treated conservatively. If surgical intervention is required, it will be a focused laparotomy or a laparoscopic procedure to evacuate the hematoma.\n(Choice C) Antibiotics are not indicated in this patient as he is afebrile and has no symptoms suggestive of infection.\n(Choice D) Surgical removal of the hematoma is only attempted after conservative measures have failed. Laparotomy or laparoscopy are accepted methods of accomplishing evacuation of the hematoma.\n(Choice E) MRI will not provide any additional information relevant to this patient's condition. CT with oral contrast is the investigation of choice for evaluating the duodenal hematomas.\nEducational objective:\nIsolated duodenal hematoma most commonly occurs in children following blunt abdominal trauma. It is treated conservatively with nasogastric suction and parenteral nutrition."

        "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe right-sided chest pain. His temperature is 37.8C (100.4F), blood pressure is 138/88 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min and respirations are 19/min and shallow. Examination shows decreased respiratory movements on the right side of the chest and tenderness on palpation over the right mid-chest. An x-ray film of the chest shows a fracture of the right 6th rib. Which of the following is the most important goal in management of the rib fracture in this patient?",
        "options": [
            "A. To achieve a tidal volume of 500 ml with intubation",
            "B. To use only intravenous colloids",
            "C. To ensure appropriate analgesia",
            "D. To provide mechanical stabilization to the chest wall",
            "E. To give prophylactic antibiotics"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rib fractures should be suspected in all patients with localized chest wall tenderness following trauma; up to half of rib fractures will not be evident on initial chest x-ray. Rib fracture is associated with significant pain, which causes hypoventilation that may ultimately result in atelectasis and pneumonia. Thus, pain management and respiratory support are the priorities in the management of rib fractures. Oral agents, such as opiates and/or NSAIDs are most commonly utilized, but an intercostal nerve block with a long-acting local anesthetic can be used if oral or systemic analgesics are not sufficiently effective. Intercostal nerve blocks provide pain relief without affecting respiratory function, as opiate analgesics may, but it does carry some risk of pneumothorax.\n(Choice A) The cause of hypoventilation in patients with rib fracture is severe pain. Pain relief will correct the hypoventilation and intubation is not needed unless respiratory decompensation occurs.\n(Choice B) Use of colloids or crystalloid has no role in management of rib fracture unless the patient has hypotension or blood loss.\n(Choice D) Mechanical stabilization of chest wall is not required in rib fractures. In fact, the external compression caused by such devices may further impair adequate ventilation.\n(Choice E) Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated routinely in management of rib fracture unless an open fracture has occurred.\nEducational objective:\nPain relief should be the prime objective in the management of rib fracture as it will allow proper ventilation and prevent atelectasis and pneumonia."

This began with mid-abdominal pain and nausea one week ago, but he was able to continue his usual activities. However, during the past two days, the pain has become worse. It is now localized to the right iliac fossa and impairs walking. He has had two episodes of vomiting during the past several hours. His temperature is 39.4C (103F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min.

            "F. IV hydration and observation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of complicated appendicitis. Perforation with a localized inflammatory infiltration is likely to be present. Patients who present more than five days after the onset of symptoms, and have localized right lower quadrant findings, should be treated with IV hydration, antibiotics and bowel rest.\nNon-operative management is usually effective. CT scan may reveal an abscess that can be drained percutaneously. Antibiotics should cover enteric gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. A second/third generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole are usually used. Cefotetan has a good coverage of gram-negative organisms and anaerobes; therefore, this can be used as monotherapy in this case.\n(Choice A) Immediate surgery in these patients increases morbidity because it often requires extensive dissection, and causes injury to other organs; therefore, it is not recommended.\n(Choices B, C and E) Other antibiotic combinations given are not adequate. Although erythromycin and vancomycin are effective against gram-positive organisms, they do not cover gram-negative organisms or anaerobes.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients who present more than five days after the onset of symptoms of appendicitis, and have localized right lower quadrant findings, should be treated with IV hydration, antibiotics and bowel rest. Antibiotics should cover enteric gram-negative organisms and anaerobes."

        "question": "A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was the restrained front passenger. He has had epigastric pain since the accident. He is hemodynamically stable and has no obvious injury or other complaints. An x-ray of the abdomen shows retroperitoneal air. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis?",
        "options": [
            "A. CT scan of the abdomen without contrast",
            "B. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage",
            "C. Colonoscopy",
            "D. CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast",
            "E. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Duodenal injury may occur during blunt trauma when the duodenum is compressed between the spine and an external solid structure like a steering wheel or seat belt during high-speed decelerating trauma. The second part of the duodenum, being retroperitoneal and therefore the least mobile, is the most commonly injured part of the duodenum in blunt abdominal trauma. Isolated duodenal injuries can be easily missed because the symptoms are subtle. Patients may complain of epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. Peritoneal signs are usually not present because the rupture is contained within the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal air on abdominal x-ray is very suggestive. CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast, confirms the diagnosis of duodenal injury and will also disclose the presence of a concomitant duodenal hematoma.\n(Choices A and E) Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and ultrasound are not sensitive for duodenal injuries. An ultrasound, however, is very useful in determining injury to many other abdominal viscera and is routinely employed in the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam, which aids surgeons in determining if a patient requires an emergent exploratory laparotomy.\n(Choice B) DPL is not sensitive for duodenal injuries because the second part of the duodenum, the most commonly injured portion of the duodenum, is retroperitoneal. DPL has largely been replaced by the FAST exam in the assessment of abdominal trauma.\n(Choice C) Although the ascending and descending colon are secondarily retroperitoneal, they are not commonly injured in blunt abdominal trauma because they do not overlie a rigid bony structure against which they may be compressed.\nEducational objective:\nRupture of the duodenum is frequently diagnosed by noting retroperitoneal air on abdominal x-ray. Duodenal injuries may then be better characterized using CT scan with oral contrast."

        "question": "A 22-year-old football player comes to the physician because of difficulty in extending his right knee. This started one month ago after he twisted his knee while playing. There was mild swelling immediately, he took pain relievers which relieved both the pain and swelling. However, now the knee motion is limited and this is significantly restricting his physical activities. Physical examination shows no swelling of the knee. While passively flexed and extended, a popping sensation is noted under the examiner's finger (which is placed at the right knee). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Bone scan",
            "B. Intraarticular steroid injection",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This patient presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of meniscal injury. The episode of injury occurred one month ago, when acute pain and swelling were present. The current symptoms suggest ‘locking’, a phenomenon that is due to impaired extension of the knee. In addition to the patient's history, a positive McMurray sign is present (popping sound on passive flexion/extension of the joint), which is specific for meniscal injury.\nThe mechanical symptoms have persisted for one month after the injury, and have impaired the activities of the patient therefore, further evaluation is necessary. It is reasonable to do an arthroscopy or MRI to confirm the diagnosis, and evaluate the extent of the injury. Surgery (arthroscopic or open) is usually necessary to correct the problem.\n(Choice A) A bone scan will not be informative in this case.\n(Choice B) Intraarticular steroid injections can be used in patients with secondary meniscal injury due to degenerative joint disease.\n(Choice E) Rest and NSAIDs are used as an initial conservative therapy for acute meniscal injury, but have no value in this case.\n(Choice D) Active exercise can be employed as part of a rehabilitation program.\nEducational Objective:\nPersistent symptoms (e.g. mechanical symptoms) in patients with probable meniscal injury should be further evaluated by MRI or arthroscopy. Surgery (arthroscopic or open) is often necessary to correct the problem."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient has suffered rapid deceleration chest trauma, likely in association with forceful impact with his vehicle's steering wheel. Chest radiography is the most important initial diagnostic study in all stabilized patients (airway, breathing and circulation secure) following blunt chest trauma. This patient's chest x-ray shows a persistent pneumothorax despite chest tube placement and pneumomediastinum, and he has subcutaneous emphysema (palpable crepitus below the skin) on physical examination. Though rare, the most likely explanation for these radiographic and clinical findings is tracheobronchial perforation secondary to blunt thoracic trauma. The right main bronchus is most commonly injured in these cases. The diagnosis can be confirmed with high-resolution CT scanning, bronchoscopy, or surgical exploration. Operative repair is indicated.\n(Choice A) Myocardial contusion classically causes tachycardia, new bundle branch blocks or arrhythmia. Sternal fracture is a commonly associated injury.\n(Choice C) Myocardial rupture causes cardiac tamponade, which manifests with muffled heart sounds, hypotension and distended neck veins. The diagnosis can be made rapidly with ultrasound, and emergent surgical repair is warranted.\n(Choice D) Esophageal rupture following blunt trauma is rare. Iatrogenic (e.g., with endoscopy) and esophagitis-related etiologies are more common. Manifestations of esophageal rupture include pneumomediastinum and pleural effusions.\n(Choice E) Patients suffering diaphragmatic rupture may experience abdominal pain, pain referred to the shoulder, shortness of breath, and/or vomiting. Radiographic studies may show abdominal viscera above the diaphragm and/or loss of the diaphragmatic contour.\n(Choice F) Hemothorax may result from injuries to the aorta, myocardium, hilar blood vessels or lung parenchyma. Symptoms depend on the degree of blood loss and can range from shortness of breath to shock.\n(Choice G) Aortic injury can cause sudden death due to aortic rupture and exsanguination. Patients sustaining rapid deceleration injuries to the chest require radiographic evaluation for aortic injury with x-ray, CT scanning and possibly transesophageal echocardiography as well.\nEducational objective:\nPersistent pneumothorax and significant air leak following chest tube placement in a patient who has sustained blunt chest trauma suggests tracheobronchial rupture. Other findings include pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema."

He is in hemodynamic shock, as evidenced by his low systolic blood pressure, obtunded mental status, and abdominal distention. Furthermore, there is a high likelihood of intraperitoneal hemorrhage resulting from injury to the liver. All hemodynamically unstable patients with sharp penetrating abdominal trauma and gunshot wounds that are believed to have entered the peritoneum must be treated with emergent exploratory laparotomy in order to prevent the development of sepsis resulting from hollow organ perforation and to prevent exsanguinating hemorrhage.\n(Choices C and G) Exploratory laparotomy should not be delayed for imaging procedures in hemodynamically unstable patients following penetrating abdominal trauma.\n(Choice D) Laparoscopy may be used in the assessment of hemodynamically stable patients who have suffered penetrating abdominal trauma in which injury to a hollow viscus or other organ cannot be readily determined clinically.\n(Choice B) Peritoneal lavage is utilized to detect intraperitoneal bleeding in cases of blunt abdominal trauma, when ultrasound is not available for a fast exam.\nEducational objective:\nAll hemodynamically unstable patients with penetrating abdominal trauma must undergo immediate exploratory laparotomy to diagnose and treat the source of bleeding, as well as to diagnose and treat perforation of any abdominal viscus in an effort to prevent sepsis."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "All patients suffering traumatic amputations should be treated as candidates for reimplantation while in the field. As such, their amputated limb or digit should be wrapped in sterile gauze, moistened with sterile saline and placed in a plastic bag. The bag should be then placed on ice and transported with the patient to the nearest emergency department. The amputated part should not be allowed to freeze. Packaging of the amputated part in this manner prolongs the viability of the part for up to 24 hours. Younger patients suffering sharp amputations with no crush injury or avulsion are the best candidates for amputation reimplantation.\n(Choice A) The amputated part should not be immersed in water as this may make digital vessel repair more difficult.\n(Choices B and D) The amputated part should not be placed in antiseptic solution or alcohol as chemical injury may occur. The patient will be appropriately treated with antibiotics and the amputated part irrigated and cleansed before reimplantation is attempted.\n(Choice E) The amputated part should not be placed directly on ice because this could result in frostbite injury to the amputated tissue and loss of viability.\nEducational objective:\nIn case of amputation injury, amputated parts should be wrapped in saline-moistened gauze, sealed in a plastic bag, placed on ice and brought to the emergency department with the patient."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acute carbon monoxide poisoning should be considered in all patients who are exposed to smoke, especially in a closed space. Carbon monoxide has over 200 times higher affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen, and it impairs the delivery of oxygen to tissue by shifting the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Carbon monoxide toxicity affects the organs with the highest demand for oxygen first, namely the brain and heart. This explains the early manifestations of carbon monoxide poisoning, which include confusion, agitation and somnolence. Chest pain or arrhythmias resulting from cardiac hypoxia may also occur. The treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning is administration of 100% oxygen via nonrebreather facemask and regular monitoring for at least four hours. 100% oxygen can decrease the half-life of carbon monoxide from three to four hours on room air to approximately one hour. Hyperbaric oxygen can be used in severe cases not responsive to facemask-administered oxygen.\n(Choice A) Endotracheal intubation is not required for administration of 100% oxygen. This patient is breathing spontaneously and is conscious, so intubation is not required.\n(Choices C and D) A bolus of 50% dextrose and intravenous thiamine is indicated in any unconscious patient as an emergency measure to assess for hypoglycemia. This patient is not unconscious and the etiology of her acute confusion is evident.\n(Choice E) Intravenous morphine in emergency setting is indicated as one component of the treatment for acute pulmonary edema. In this patient, morphine would be counterproductive because it would suppress her respiratory drive.\nEducational Objective:\nAll patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning should be treated with 100% oxygen via a nonrebreather facemask. Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are typically neurologic and include agitation, confusion and somnolence."

Eclampsia and preeclampsia are most common in young primigravida women. The seizures in eclampsia are typically self-limited tonic clonic in nature. Initial treatment includes magnesium sulfate and antihypertensives, but delivery is the only definitive therapy. Posterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint classically occurs during a tonic-clonic seizure or electrocution. On exam the arm is held adducted and internally rotated and fullness is palpable posteriorly while the anterior shoulder is flat.\n(Choice A) Todd's paralysis refers to transient unilateral weakness following a tonic-clonic seizure.\n(Choice B) Magnesium toxicity manifests first with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and generalized muscle weakness. DTR will be decreased or absent. This is unlikely in this patient who just received magnesium.\n(Choice C) Anterior dislocations are the most common form of shoulder dislocation. In anterior dislocations, the arm is held in slight abduction and external rotation.\n(Choice E) Acromioclavicular dislocation (shoulder separation) is not likely in the above setting. This injury requires a significant traumatic blow to the shoulder. Symptoms include pain and swelling; no arm posturing is associated with this injury.\nEducational Objective:\nPosterior dislocations of the shoulder may follow tonic-clonic seizures. In posterior shoulder dislocation the arm is classically held adducted and internally rotated and fullness is palpable on the posterior shoulder. Neurovascular impairment is unusual."

        "question": "A 21-year-old female military recruit presented to the physician's office because of pain in her right foot. The pain started a few weeks ago and initially only occurred with activity, but now the pain is present even at rest. She has no history of obvious trauma. Examination shows swelling and warmth in the foot and point tenderness over the second metatarsal. Plain films of the foot show a hairline fracture of the shaft of the second metatarsal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
            "A. Bone scan",
            "B. MRI of the foot",
            "C. Rest and analgesics",
            "D. Plaster cast",
            "E. Surgical intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The patient described has a nondisplaced hairline (stress) fracture of the second metatarsal. Metatarsal stress fractures typically occur in athletes and military recruits, particularly due to the sudden and drastic increase in activity by the latter. The second metatarsal, which is subjected to significant extremes of loading during gait, is the most commonly involved metatarsal. Patients present complaining of slow onset foot pain that initially only occurs with activity but later is present during rest as well. Point tenderness over the affected metatarsal is present on examination. Fractures of the second, third and fourth metatarsals are managed conservatively because the surrounding metatarsals act as splints and nonunion is uncommon. Rest and pain control are the most appropriate treatments in this case. Patients may additionally be managed with a hard-sole shoe and light activity may be resumed immediately.\n(Choices A and B) Bone scan and MRI of the foot may be used to make the diagnosis of a metatarsal stress fracture if plain radiographs are unable to demonstrate the fracture. The patient described already has radiographic evidence of a fracture; additional imaging studies are unnecessary.\n(Choice D) Plaster casting is used for patients with persistent pain following more conservative treatment as detailed above.\n(Choice E) Surgical intervention is reserved for fractures of the fifth metatarsal, such as Jones fractures, or for displaced fractures not amenable to closed reduction.\nEducational objective:\nStress (hairline) fractures of the metatarsals are not uncommon in athletes and military recruits; the second metatarsal is most commonly injured. Treatment is with rest, analgesia and a hard-soled shoe."

            "E. Septic arthritis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone. The incidence of this malignancy is highest in the second decade of life, and it most commonly occurs at sites of rapid bone growth, such as the metaphyses of the distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal humerus. Patients typically present complaining of persistent bone pain that may be worse at night. Systemic manifestations are rare and pathologic fractures are uncommon. The ESR is normal while the serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated. X-ray shows a destructive lesion and periosteal new bone formation with periosteal elevation (Codman's triangle). A spiculated \"sunburst\" pattern within the tumor may also be seen radiographically.\n(Choice B) Ewing's sarcoma is also most common in the second decade of life. It is a small, round, blue cell (neuroectodermal) malignancy classically associated with systemic features such as fever, malaise and weight loss. It typically affects the diaphyses of long bones as well as the spine and pelvis. X-ray shows an osteolytic lesion with onion-skin appearance.\n(Choice C) Chronic osteomyelitis may present with painful swelling, fever and laboratory abnormalities including an elevated ESR and leukocytosis. Chronic osteomyelitis most commonly results from contiguous spread of infection from an adjacent site, such as the skin. This is commonly seen in diabetic foot ulcers.\n(Choice D) Osteoclastoma (giant cell tumor of bone), is a tumor of adults that often involves the epiphysis of the distal femur or proximal tibia. Radiology characteristically shows a soap-bubble appearance due to the osteolytic quality of the tumor.\n(Choice E) Patients with septic arthritis are typically clinically ill-appearing with fever and chills. The joint is painful, has limited range of motion and exhibits marked inflammatory signs such as erythema and swelling.\nEducational objective:\nOsteogenic sarcoma (osteosarcoma) is the most common primary malignancy of bone. It most commonly affects males in their second decade preferentially in the metaphyses of long bones. Patients present with bone pain but do not have systemic symptoms."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All gunshot wounds that are reasonably believed to have penetrated the peritoneum require exploratory laparotomy. This differs from the current management of stab wounds and other penetrating trauma, which may be observed and treated conservatively in some cases, because of the blast effect of the bullet. The trajectory of the bullet described certainly penetrated the pleura and the abdominal cavity at the dome of the diaphragm on the left where the spleen and gastric fundus resides. The purpose of laparotomy in such cases is to ensure that there is no life-threatening injury, such as bowel trauma or hemorrhage. Any gunshot wound below the anterior 4th intercostal space (approximately the level of nipple) is considered to involve the abdomen.\n(Choice B) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exams are helpful but are not yet sufficiently sensitive to replace exploratory laparotomy in abdominal gunshot wounds.\n(Choice A, C and E) The patient described is hemodynamically stable and is unlikely to have sustained damage to the heart or pericardium given the trajectory of the wound and his clinical presentation. Severe hemothorax or pneumothorax would cause respiratory distress and may be treated with a chest tube; small hemothoraces and pneumothoraces may be observed.\nEducational Objective:\nAny gunshot wound of the abdomen requires exploratory laparotomy. Any gunshot wound below the 4th intercostal space (the level of nipple) is considered to involve the abdomen."

Examination shows a mildly distended abdomen that is very tender to palpation in the epigastric region without rebound; bowel sounds are absent; rectal examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray film of the abdomen shows gaseous distention of the small bowel in the upper abdomen. CT with contrast shows diffuse hypodense enlargement of the pancreas and peripancreatic and perirenal fluid collections.

        "explanation": "The patient described is suffering from acute pancreatitis with a secondary ileus. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcohol consumption, hypertriglyceridemia and recent ERCP. Treatment of pancreatitis is primarily supportive with intravenous fluids, NG tube suction, NPO and analgesia. In severe cases, antibiotics are indicated, and calcium and magnesium levels should be monitored and replaced as needed. A cause for the pancreatitis should also be sought. Choledocholithiasis is the most common cause of pancreatitis, and an ultrasound study early in the disease process may detect the offending stone before it is passed.\n(Choice A) The patient has evidence of a mild metabolic alkalosis (increased HCO3-) most likely due to vomiting. Bicarbonate is not indicated at this time.\n(Choice B) Evidence does not support the use of pancreatic protease inhibitors in acute pancreatitis.\n(Choices C and D) Carbachol is a cholinomimetic agent that stimulates contraction of the bowel musculature. As such, it may contract the sphincter of Oddi thereby worsening this patient's pain. In fact, anticholinergics have been tested in the treatment of acute pancreatitis in an effort to relax this sphincter but have shown no benefit. This ileus is expected to resolve with the improvement of the pancreatitis.\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment of pancreatitis is primarily supportive. Antibiotics may be used, but the evidence does not presently support the use of antacids, anticholinergics, glucagon or octreotide. Identifying the underlying cause may facilitate prevention of recurrent pancreatitis."

        "explanation": "The differential diagnosis of a widened mediastinum as a solitary finding includes processes as diverse as anthrax, various tumors, mediastinitis, aortic dissection, hemorrhage and large pericardial effusion among others. Because this patient has just undergone a surgical procedure involving the mediastinum and has laboratory and clinical findings suggestive of an infection, acute mediastinitis is the most likely diagnosis. Mediastinitis complicates up to 5% of sternotomies. Like an abscess, the treatment of mediastinitis requires drainage, debridement and antibiotic therapy. One in five patients with acute mediastinitis will not survive despite treatment.\n(Choices A and D) Fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia and chest pain might be the signs of postpericardiotomy syndrome. This syndrome is autoimmune in nature and classically occurs a few weeks following any procedure where the pericardium is incised. Treatment is with pericardial puncture if tamponade occurs, and with aspirin or corticosteroids to address the inflammation.\n(Choice C) Postoperative mediastinal hemorrhage is less likely to become symptomatic on the 10th day; most hematomas occur within the first 48 hours of a procedure. Moreover hemorrhage would not likely cause fever and leukocytosis.\n(Choice E) Antibiotic therapy alone is not sufficient for this disease.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute mediastinitis may occur following heart surgery. Signs and symptoms include fever, chest pain, leukocytosis and mediastinal widening on chest x-ray. Mediastinitis is a serious condition that requires drainage, debridement and antibiotic therapy."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This patient has anterior cord syndrome following spinal cord injury due to a motor vehicle accident. Anterior cord syndrome is characterized by selective damage to the corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts. These tracts course in the anterior portion of the spinal cord and transmit motor and pain / temperature sensation, respectively. Clinically, anterior cord syndrome is suggested by paralysis and loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of injury while posterior column functions such as fine touch, vibration, pressure, and proprioception are preserved. All trauma patients should be evaluated for spinal injury. If the neurological examination is suggestive of blunt spinal cord trauma, immediate administration of high-dose intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone) is indicated.\n(Choice A) Immediate surgical intervention for spinal injuries is currently limited to relieving impingement on the spinal cord caused by foreign bodies, herniated disks, bony fracture fragments or an epidural hematoma.\n(Choices B and D) All patients with clinical evidence of a spinal cord injury should be imaged with CT scan to assess the bone and MRI to assess the cord and other soft tissues, such as the intervertebral disks. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids should not be delayed for these imaging procedures.\n(Choice E) Watchful observation is not indicated in this patient with clinical evidence of spinal cord injury.\nEducational objective:\nPatients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone within eight hours of spinal cord injury have significant and sustained motor and sensory neurological improvement. Thus, its use is warranted as the first priority after stabilizing a patient with clinical evidence of spinal cord injury."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient's history of motor vehicle accident, abdominal wall ecchymosis, distended abdomen, and decreased bowel sounds is suspicious for blunt abdominal trauma. Furthermore, collapsed neck veins and hypotension indicate hemodynamic instability. In a hemodynamically unstable victim of a motor vehicle accident with suspected blunt abdominal trauma, the appropriate management involves cervical spine immobilization, intravenous hydration and FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma). If ultrasound shows blood in the peritoneal cavity of a hemodynamically unstable patient, then urgent laparotomy with surgical repair is indicated (Choice B). Ultrasound is not reliable in identifying solid organ injury.\n(Choice A) The use of laparoscopy in cases of blunt abdominal trauma is debatable and hemodynamic instability is an absolute contraindication to laparoscopy.\n(Choice C) x-ray films of the abdomen and pelvis would be useful for identifying pelvic, rib, or vertebral fractures. However, this patient is hemodynamically unstable with confirmed bleeding in the peritoneal cavity. The first priority in this patient is to address the source of bleeding and resolve the hypotension via laparotomy and surgical repair.\n(Choice D) A hemodynamically stable patient with intraperitoneal blood identified on ultrasound should undergo a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast. A CT scan allows the amount of intraperitoneal blood to be quantified and can often identify the site of injury. The surgeon can then select either laparotomy or admission and observation, based on the CT result.\n(Choice E) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage should be performed in any hemodynamically unstable patient with an equivocal or poor quality ultrasound exam.\n(Choice F) Observation and resuscitation is not appropriate in a hemodynamically unstable patient with internal bleeding. Surgeons sometimes select this course of management over laparotomy when the CT of the abdomen demonstrates limited and controlled bleeding/injury in a stable patient.\nEducational Objective:\nFor hemodynamically unstable patients in whom blunt abdominal trauma is suspected, fluid resuscitation should be initiated, followed by ultrasound examination. If ultrasound reveals intraperitoneal blood, the patient should then undergo urgent laparotomy for surgical repair."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The patient described most likely has a hydrocele. A hydrocele is a fluid collection within the processus or tunica vaginalis — the peritoneal projection that accompanies the testis during its descent into the scrotum. When the processus vaginalis fails to obliterate, peritoneal fluid may accumulate within the processus vaginalis causing a communicating hydrocele. A collection of fluid within a tunica vaginalis that has properly obliterated its communication with the peritoneum is a noncommunicating hydrocele. Hydrocele can be differentiated from other testicular masses by transillumination; a hydrocele will transilluminate while other masses will not. Most hydroceles, both communicating and noncommunicating, will resolve spontaneously by the age of 12 months and can be safely observed during that period.\n(Choice A) Risks of aspiration include the potential for infection and damage to nearby structures. It is not reasonable to put the patient at risk for a lesion that will likely resolve spontaneously.\n(Choice B) Communicating hydroceles that persist beyond 12 months of age are unlikely to resolve spontaneously and put the patient at increased risk of indirect inguinal hernia. Surgical intervention is indicated in such cases.\n(Choice C) Ultrasound imaging of the mass described is not unreasonable but is not required as the diagnosis is apparent by physical exam.\n(Choice E) Nephrotic syndrome generally causes generalized edema. It is very unlikely in this patient.\nEducational Objective:\nMost cases of hydrocele will disappear spontaneously by the age of 12 months and can be safely observed during that period. Hydroceles that do not resolve spontaneously should be removed surgically due to the risk of inguinal hernia."

The discomfort has been there for several months, and she recently started having breast pain before menses. Yesterday she noticed a lump in her breast. She has no family history of breast cancer. She smokes one pack of cigarettes every day. She had a baseline mammogram at age 35, which showed no abnormalities. Examination shows a smooth, soft, mobile mass palpable in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, some diffuse nodularity is present bilaterally. Vital signs are normal.

            "E. Recommend ultrasound evaluation of the aspirated cyst"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fibrocystic condition of the breast is the most common cause of benign breast masses. It is most common in women 30 to 50 years of age. Presentation is classically with breast pain that worsens around the time of menses. The breast masses associated with fibrocystic disease often occur and resolve rapidly. On exam the cysts are tender and mobile. Because carcinoma can not be completely ruled out, fine needle aspiration biopsy of a representative or dominant mass is indicated. Typically, the aspirate from such masses is serous and non-bloody, and typically the cysts disappear completely after aspiration. After aspiration, the mass should be observed for recurrence, and if the mass does recur a tissue biopsy is indicated.\n(Choices A and E) Mammogram would be indicated if the mass did not disappear completely or if its contents were bloody. If the normal breast tissue is dense, as in young women, a mass may not be seen on mammogram. In such cases, ultrasound would be indicated.\n(Choice B) Oral contraceptives may worsen the discomfort associated with fibrocystic change as estrogen is believed to be a causative factor. Additionally, this patient is a smoker over age 35 and thus use of OCPs increases the risk of thromboembolic disease.\n(Choice D) There is no need to send the nonbloody aspirate for cytologic evaluation as false negative results may cause an inappropriate sense of security.\nEducational Objective:\nA breast mass that produces a non-bloody aspirate and disappears completely on aspiration does not need any further evaluation other than observation for recurrence."

            "E. Give her oral steroids"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient is experiencing anaphylactic shock secondary to a bee sting. This is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction classically mediated by widespread IgE-dependent mast cell and basophil degranulation following exposure to an antigen. The most common causes of such reactions are antibiotics, hymenoptera stings and food. One must have been previously exposed to the offending antigen in order to experience anaphylaxis as the reaction results from preformed IgE, which itself results from a Th2-dependent response to the initial antigen exposure. Patients experiencing anaphylaxis typically first experience pruritus, flushing and urticaria. Respiratory symptoms such as chest tightness, stridor and a \"full\" or \"lumpy\" sensation in the throat follow and may ultimately progress to respiratory distress and failure due to laryngeal edema. Widespread histamine-mediated peripheral vasodilation causes hypotension and ultimately circulatory collapse. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and should be promptly treated with subcutaneous epinephrine. Epinephrine is effective because it exerts both alpha and beta-adrenergic effects resulting in vasoconstriction, bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and a decrease in vascular permeability thereby counteracting the primary pathophysiologic disturbances in anaphylaxis.\n(Choices A & E) Glucocorticoids have no significant immediate effect, however, they may prevent relapse of severe reactions and may be used in patients following the administration of epinephrine.\n(Choice C) Antihistamines are useful in facilitating relief of urticaria, angioedema and bronchospasm as ancillary agents, but epinephrine should be given first.\n(Choice D) Removing the embedded stinger immediately following the sting is appropriate as the stinging apparatus actively injects venom into the wound for 1 minute after the sting. People who have been stung should remove the bee stinger immediately by any means. Patients with established anaphylactic shock to hymenoptera stings should immediately self-administer epinephrine.\nEducational objective:\nHymenoptera stings account for more deaths in the United States than any other envenomation. Anaphylactic shock of any cause should be promptly treated with subcutaneous epinephrine in order to acutely prevent respiratory distress and circulatory collapse."
