    "question": "A 33-year-old woman develops a painful, swollen right knee. Culture of the joint fluid aspirate grows organisms on chocolate agar but not on blood agar. The most likely causal organism has which of the following properties?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antigenically variable pili",
      "B. Both hyphae and spores",
      "C. Cannot make ATP",
      "D. No true cell wall",
      "E. Visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent. The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults. The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Having both hyphae and spores (choice B) would be true of Candida, which usually causes arthritis as a rare complication of systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma do not have true cell walls (choice D) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete that is visible only with darkfield microscopy (choice E) or direct fluorescent antibody. Secondary syphilis can (uncommonly) cause an acute arthritis, but syphilis is rare in an otherwise healthy adult."

    "question": "A 10-year-old boy develops an abscess on his left knee. Examination of the exudate shows neutrophils containing mixed bacterial flora. Which of the following is the most important virulence factor for bacterial survival within the phagolysosome?",
    "options": [
      "A. Catalase",
      "B. Hemolysin",
      "C. Hyaluronidase",
      "D. Streptokinase",
      "E. Tetanospasmin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome. Tetanospasmin (choice E) is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani It inhibits the inhibitory mediators glycine and GABA, and promotes the rigid paralysis of tetanus. It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome."

    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of sore throat and a fever. Physical examination shows pharyngeal erythema with a tonsillar abscess. Culture of oropharyngeal secretions on sheep's blood agar grows colonies of gram-positive cocci that are surrounded by a zone of complete hemolysis. Another culture of the secretions on mannitol salt agar grows well and causes the medium to turn yellow. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "E. Streptococcus salivarius"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus , since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae. (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx, constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) | a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx, and a tonsillar exudate. Streptococcus salivarius (choice E) is a gram-positive coccus that is usually alpha-hemolytic_ It is normal flora of the oral cavity and is sometimes implicated in subacute bacterial endocarditis, but is not associated with tonsillar abscesses."

      "E. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "F. Streptococcus sanguis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Streptococcus bovis is a group D Streptococcus. There is a significant association between S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon and other colonic diseases. Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are reported to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. The group D Streptococci are distinguished by having a cell wall carbohydrate composed of glycerol teichoic acid. S. agalactiae (choice A) Is a group B Streptococcus that is the number-one cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia in the United States. S. mutans and S. sanguis (choices C and F) are viridans streptococci, which are normal flora of the oral mucosa. While they are associated with bacterial endocarditis, it is usually associated with invasive dental work and a preexisting heart valve defect. S. pneumoniae (choice D) , which is a non-groupable Streptococcus (it does not have a C cell wall carbohydrate), is the most common cause of typical pneumonia in the United States. S. pyogenes (choice E) is a group A Streptococcus and is associated with pharyngitis, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever."

Laboratory studies show that he is HIV-positive by ELISA and Western blot. His CD4 cell count is 225/mm^3. He declines anti-retroviral therapy. Which of the following sets of findings is most likely at his next visit? Virus, p24, RNA / CD4+ / Anti-p24 / Anti-env",

      "B. Increasing / Decreasing / Increasing / Decreasing slightly",
      "C. Increasing / No change / Increasing / Decreasing slightly",
      "D. Decreasing / Normal / No change / No change",
      "E. Undetectable / Normal / Decreasing / Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 225/mm^3, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient measured for p24 or viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases, CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood. This does not happen in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy."

      "B. It lacks a cell wall",
      "C. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol",
      "D. Its cell wall contains mycolic acids",
      "E. It uses an elementary body to infect cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This young woman is infected with Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells. It has sterols in its membrane (choice A) is a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These are the only prokaryotes that totally lack a cell wall, but instead have sterols in their membranes. It lacks a cell wall (choice B) is also a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These prokaryotes are devoid of a cell wall, but have sterols in their membranes. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol (choice C) is a statement that describes the fungi. The ergosterol molecule is unique to fungi, and is the target molecule for nystatin and the imidazoles. A cell wall containing mycolic acids (choice D) describes the genus Mycobacterium. Mycolic acids are long-chain fatty acids that give this group its resistance to environmental stresses and its acid-fast staining characteristics."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of recurrent growth of a whitish film on his tongue and buccal mucosa. There is no evidence of esophageal involvement. A scraping of the lesion is placed in a test tube containing animal serum and the results of this evaluation are shown in the photomicrograph. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug of choice for this patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. It blocks ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase",
      "B. It inhibits the CYP450—dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-a-demethylase",
      "C. It inhibits the synthesis of beta-glucan",
      "D. It interferes with mitotic spindle function",
      "E. It interferes with thymidylate synthetase and DNA synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans , which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test: the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-a-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-a-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the 'conazole' antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A) . This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however, this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patient's oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum. Flucytosine interferes with thymidylate synthetase (choice E). This agent is used in the treatment of cryptococcosis. It is contraindicated in HIV patients, as it may cause bone marrow suppression in those patients."

The flask is incubated for 48 hours and the progeny viruses are analyzed. Four distinct variants of influenza A are isolated: H3N2, H1N1, H3N1, and H1N2. Which of the following viral attributes most likely made the production of H3N1 and H1N2 variants possible?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. High mutational rate",
      "C. Phenotypic mixing",
      "D. Segmented genome",
      "E. Syncytia formation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift, or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

      "D. Nonmycotic mycetoma",
      "E. Pharyngitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes malignant otitis externa, which is a severe necrotizing infection of the external ear canal. Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone, temporal bone, sigmoid sinus, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Patients at increased risk include the elderly, people with diabetes, and the immunocompromised. Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes (since the organism can be cultured from the shoes), burn infections, and pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients. Ecthyma gangrenosum is the name of the characteristic lesion that occurs during Pseudomonas septicemias. It has a black, necrotic center and a raised hemorrhagic ring outside. Erythema migrans (choice B) is the target-shaped rash that occurs in the early stages of Lyme disease. Food poisoning (choice C) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas. Nonmycotic mycetoma (choice D) is caused by Actinomyces and Nocardia. Pharyngitis (choice E) is not commonly caused by Pseudomonas."

      "E. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, naked, icosahedral virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Outbreaks occur seasonally in winter and early spring. Infection does not result in lasting immunity, and reinfection can occur. The virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, a group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are nonsegmented, helical, and enveloped. Double-stranded DNA, naked, icosahedral virus (choice A) describes the Adenoviruses, which are capable of causing conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory disease, and gastroenteritis. However, these agents are not common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Negative-sense, single-stranded RNA with eight segments, helical, enveloped virus (choice C) describes the Orthomyxoviruses, which include influenza virus. Influenza is a systemic illness characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgias, malaise, and prostration, followed by cough, nasal obstruction, and sore throat. The lower respiratory tract may also be involved. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, helical, enveloped virus (choice D) describes the Coronaviruses, which cause the common cold (nasal obstruction and discharge, sneezing, mild or no fever, occasional sore throat, and/or cough) and acute pharyngitis (sore throat with or without cervical adenopathy, ulceration, and conjunctivitis). SARS-CoV also belongs to this family and causes a seasonal acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is usually imported into this hemisphere from the Far East. Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA naked, icosahedral virus (choice E) describes the Picornaviruses and Caliciviruses. Within the Picornaviridae, rhinoviruses cause the common cold but would not be common agents of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants."

      "B. Introns",
      "C. Points of bacteriophage insertion",
      "D. Points of site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. A resistance transfer factor is a bacterial plasmid that encodes one or more drug-resistance genes and has the capability of mediating its own transfer to another bacterium during conjugation (it possesses the tra operon). Most of the known resistance transfer factors have been formed by the accumulation of transposons into fertility factor plasmids. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are capable of movement within bacterial cells. When they carry drug-resistance genes and accumulate in plasmids that already possess the tra operon, multiple drug-resistant plasmids (resistance transfer factors) are formed. The flanking sequences in the DNA of a transposon are indirect repeats that are complementary and antiparallel to one another. When transposons insert themselves into a new location, they do so by site-specific recombination, creating direct repeats (identical nucleotide sequences created during the repair of a staggered cut created by the transposon restriction endonuclease). Therefore, in the diagram shown, the rectangular blocks could represent either the direct repeats caused by transposition or the indirect repeats that are the outside edges of the mobile segments of DNA. In either event, they are representations of points at which transposons have inserted their mobile DNA via site-specific recombination. Gene loci for recombinase enzymes (choice A) is not correct. Although each transposon (and there are three that have moved to create the resistance transfer factor shown) carries its own restriction endonuclease and the gene that encodes it, the diagram clearly shows the presence of two rectangles for each of the transposons, and a given transposon would carry only one copy, not two copies, of its endonuclease gene. Introns (choice B) are repetitive, non-transcribed segments of DNA that do not occur in prokaryotes. Points of bacteriophage insertion (choice C), or insertion sequences, are palindromic sequences of nucleotides in a bacterial genome that are identical to those found in the genomes of temperate phages. When these sequences are cleaved by a restriction endonuclease, the phage genome can be inserted by site-specific recombination into the bacterial chromosome and the state of lysogeny is begun. Bacteriophages are not involved in the formation of resistance transfer factors. Transposons (choice E) are mobile segments of DNA that are responsible for the formation of multiple drug-resistant plasmids such as the one shown here, but they are not represented by the rectangular blocks. In the diagram, the transposons are the sequences between the rectangular blocks, so there are three transposons that accumulated here to create this resistance transfer factor."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient probably has hepatic amebiasis, which is a life-threatening complication of intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. E. histolytica is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Intestinal colonization (which may be asymptomatic) always precedes infection of the liver. The abscesses generally contain necrotic debris, with amoebas located along the edges of the abscess. Treatment for liver abscesses of this origin is metronidazole, while iodoquinol is useful to destroy the luminal stages of the parasite. Ascaris lumbricoides (choice A) can cause intestinal obstruction, and may cause abscesses If it invades the common bile duct. It would not cause bloody diarrhea. Enterobius vermicularis (choice C) is the pinworm, which inhabits the rectum. Bloody diarrhea can also be seen with some strains of Salmonella (choice D) and Shigella (choice E) , but these organisms do not usually cause hepatic abscesses. Bacterial causes of hepatic abscesses include E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, and Pseudomonas."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This is a classic case of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis. Clues include the patient population (HIV-positive), and the CSF findings suggesting a fungal etiology. Cryptococcus is the most common fungal meningitis of the immunocompromised in the United States. It is a monomorphic fungus, unlike many of the classic pathogens within the fungal group, so the encapsulated yeast form would be found both in clinical specimens and in the environment as the infectious form. Broad-based, budding yeasts (choice A) would be the forms expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Blastomyces dermatitidis , which is far more likely to present with skin and bone lesions than with meningitis. Budding yeasts in a \"pilot's wheel\" arrangement (choice B) would be the form expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which is limited in geographic region to Central and South America and typically presents as a primary pulmonary disease. Intracellular yeasts within macrophages (choice D) are the diagnostic form of Histoplasma capsulatum , which, despite its name, is not an encapsulated yeast. It is primarily a pulmonary infection acquired by exposure to the droppings of birds or bats. Septate hyphae with 45-degree angles (choice E) are the transmission forms of Aspergillus which is a major opportunistic infection. Aspergillus may cause meningitis in this patient population, but it is not nearly as common as Cryptococcus.

When the typical \"slapped-cheek\" rash begins, the student is no longer contagious. The rash begins with the erythematous cheeks, then the upper part of the body becomes red and then reticulated, i.e., the typical lacy appearance of the rash develops. This fades but can come and go for the next 3 weeks. Parvovirus is a cause of aplastic anemia. It may be responsible for aplastic crises in patients with sickle-cell anemia. In addition, exposure of a pregnant woman in the first trimester may result in a fetus with aplastic anemia, which results in non-immune hydrops fetalis. Because the virus infects immature erythrocytes, causing severe anemia, the fetus dies of cardiac failure. Congenital heart defects (choice A) may occur due to many different reasons. They are, however, associated with the congenital rubella syndrome, in which a patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis are most commonly seen. Cutaneous scarring (choice B) occurs in an infant with congenital varicella syndrome (exposure to varicella during pregnancy). The other major feature is limb defects. Hemolytic anemias (choice C) are usually not associated with prenatal exposure to an infectious agent. They may be produced due to isoimmunization (Rh disease), red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis), or red cell enzyme defects (pyruvate kinase deficiency), as well as many other etiologies. Hydrocephalus (choice D) also has diverse etiologies. There is an association with prenatal exposure to mumps and the fetal development of aqueductal stenosis resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus."

    "question": "An 8-year-old girl is brought fo the physician because of a fever, sore throat, and rash. Physical examination shows an exudative pharyngitis. cervical lymphadenopathy and tenderness, and a diffuse, sandpaper-like erythematous rash. Which of the following mechanisms is responsible for the expression of the toxin that produces these signs?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Homologous recombination",
      "C. Lysogenic conversion",
      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The question describes a girl with streptococcal pharyngitis with a characteristic rash. This combination is scarlet fever, and is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes via its erythrogenic exotoxins (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin: SPE). SPE-A, SPE-B, and SPE-C. The production of this extra virulence is an example of lysogenic conversion. In this case, the DNA of a temperate phage is inserted into the bacterial chromosome and produces a prophage. Besides the repressor protein, the prophage DNA also directs the synthesis of other gene products that make the bacteria more pathogenic. Conjugation (choice A) is one of the three methods whereby DNA is transferred from one cell to another. In this case, it is done by cell-to-cell contact. It is not the means by which the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins are expressed. Homologous recombination (choice B) is a gene exchange process that stabilizes some genes that have been introduced by conjugation, transformation, or transduction. During the process, there is an exchange of pieces of DNA between a linear piece of DNA and a region on the stable circular bacterial chromosome. In site-specific recombination (choice D), a DNA molecule is integrated into a molecule of DNA with which it has no homology, except for a small site on each DNA that is called an insertion site. The end result is the sum of the two original DNA molecules. Transformation (choice E) is another way in which genes are transferred. In this case, naked DNA is taken up by another cell. Cells that can take up naked DNA from the environment need to become competent, and do so under certain environmental conditions. The newly introduced DNA is generally linear, homologous DNA from the same type of cell, but one that may be genetically diverse. Once introduced into the new cell, some genes may become stabilized by homologous recombination."

    "question": "During an investigational study, new combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules are found on the progeny viruses of a prevalent serotype of the swine influenza virus and the prevalent serotype of the human influenza virus. The progeny viruses are genetically stable when purified and are used to infect new tissue cultures. Which of the following mechanisms most likely accounts for the production of the new viral progeny?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complementation",
      "B. Genetic drift",
      "C. Genetic shift",
      "D. Phenotypic masking",
      "E. Phenotypic mixing"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza and other viruses with segmented genomes (Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus) are capable of genetic reassortment. This is an accidental \"shuffling\" of the segments of genomic RNA so that new genetic combinations can be produced. Viruses that have segmented genomes have multiple pieces of RNA that must be assembled correctly in the progeny to produce a new generation that is identical to the parental generation. When accidental rearrangements occur, genetic shift results; and in influenza, this is responsible for the production of pandemics of disease. Complementation (choice A) occurs when two viruses infect a single cell. If one is defective in a certain gene product, progeny viruses can be produced as long as that defect can be \"complemented\" by the makeup of the other virus. If both viruses have the same defect, no progeny viruses can be produced. In the case given here, two viable viruses were grown in a single cell and new combinations of surface molecules were produced. Genetic drift (choice B) refers to random mutational changes that can occur in any reproducing organism. These changes can change the surface of the organism, which affects the host immune response to the organism. Changes such as these are more gradual than genetic shift, and are best described in viruses such as HIV. Phenotypic masking (choice D) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell, and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is created from the genome of one of the viruses while the genome included in the capsid is from the other virus. Thus, one genome is \"masked,\" or covered with the antigens of the other virus. In the case described here, combinations of surface molecules were expressed. Phenotypic mixing (choice E) refers to occasions in which two related viruses infect a cell and the capsid produced in the progeny generation is a mixture of the capsid antigens from the two parental viruses. Since the genomic RNA is not actually reassorted in that case, it would not be a stable genetic change but simply a reflection of the antigens of both parental viruses being inserted on the surfaces of a single progeny generation."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This case is classic for rheumatic fever, which is diagnosed by a positive Jones criteria (2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria) in the presence of a previous history of Streptococcus infection. Major criteria: * Migratory polyarthritis * Carditis * Subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees * Erythema marginatum * Sydenham chorea. Minor criteria: * Fever * Arthralgia Joint pain without swelling * Laboratory abnormalities: increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased C-reactive protein, leukocytosis * Electrocardiogram abnormalities: a prolonged PR interval * Evidence of Group A Strep infection: elevated Antistreptolysin O titer, or DNAase * Previous rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease. Rheumatic fever is a sequela of untreated infection with group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes). Strep. pyogenes is differentiated from the other beta-hemolytic streptococci by its sensitivity to the antibiotic bacitracin.

      "D. Gram-positive diplococci",
      "E. Gram-positive rods"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen that is associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and that commonly causes cystitis. It is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod that reduces nitrates to nitrites. It is important to know that the pili and motility of the bacteria contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with cystitis can develop bacteremia and subsequent septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The present patient has an obstructive lesion of the urinary tract that predisposes him to the overgrowth of microorganisms such as E. coli. Pulmonary symptoms are consistent with ARDS. Gram-negative diplococci (choice A) might be a Neisseria sp. or Moraxella catarrhalis. N. gonorrhoeae is the cause of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that presents asymptomatically or with urethritis. Patients are usually younger and sexually active. M. catarrhalis is usually implicated as a cause of otitis media and sinusitis in children. It is also implicated as a cause of purulent tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in a population of patients who are older than 50 years and who have underlying obstructive lung disease. Gram-positive cocci (choice C), such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, rarely cause cystitis. S. saprophyticus causes UTIs, but the patients are typically young, sexually active women. Enterococcus is a relatively common cause of UTIs in hospitalized patients with indwelling urinary catheters who are receiving broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Enterococcal bacteremia can lead to endocarditis, but would not commonly cause ARDS. Gram-positive diplococci (choice D) would be a description of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Gram-positive rods (choice E) would include members of the following genera: Clostridium, Bacillus, Listeria, and Corynebacterium. The only significant member of this group to produce UTIs is Corynebacterium urealyticum ( C. jeikeium ). This organism creates an alkaline urine environment with the potential for stone formation. Patients are usually immunocompromised or have had recurrent UTIs."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Hepatitis E is an important cause of epidemics of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. These infections are most common in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America and are associated with a very high mortality among pregnant women. Hepatitis E is caused by a naked capsid RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae (formerly Caliciviridae). Adenoviridae (choice A) is a group of naked capsid double-stranded DNA viruses that may cause upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis, but are not generally associated with hepatitis. Flaviviridae (choice B) is the family to which hepatitis C virus belongs. This is an enveloped RNA virus that is usually transmitted sexually or parenterally, and although it is associated with a high degree of chronicity and carcinogenesis, it is not usually a cause of high mortality among pregnant women. Hepadnaviridae (choice C) is the family to which hepatitis B virus belongs. It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that is sexually or parenterally transmitted. It is associated with the production of chronic infections and hepatocellular carcinoma, but is not known for causing high mortality among pregnant women. Picornaviridae (choice E) is the family of naked capsid RNA viruses to which hepatitis A virus belongs. Although this virus is fecal-orally transmitted and therefore more common in developing countries, it is not associated with a high degree of mortality in pregnant women."

      "D. JC virus",
      "E. Poliovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Most RNA viruses (e.g., poliovirus) replicate in the cytoplasm and therefore can replicate in enucleated cells. Poliovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae. These viruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA. The exception to the rule regarding RNA viruses is the family Orthomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses (choice C). Orthomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral mRNA transcription. Adenoviruses (choice A) are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome. All DNA viruses except the family Poxviridae carry out their replication in the nucleus, and therefore would not be capable of completing their life cycles in enucleated cells. Cytomegalovirus (choice B) is a member of family Herpesviridae. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded linear DNA genome, and thus replicates in the nucleus. JC virus (choice D) belongs to family Polyomaviridae. It is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains a double-stranded circular DNA genome. It would not be able to complete its life cycle in an enucleated cell."

      "D. 3.2x10^3",
      "E. 1.28x10^4"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. During the lag time, by definition, bacteria newly introduced into a culture will undergo metabolic changes necessary for use of the medium, but will not increase in number. Therefore, at the end of the first 30 minutes of elapsed time, the number of bacteria in the culture will be 2 x 10^2. Thereafter, the number of bacteria will double every 20 minutes (the definition of \"generation time\"). This means that after 2.5 hours of total elapsed time (150 minutes), there is 120 minutes of growth time (150 - 30). Six generations will have occurred (120 minutes / 20 minutes/generation). The final number of bacteria will be the initial inoculum multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of generations: (2 x 10^2) * 2^6 = 200 * 64 = 12800 = 1.28 x 10^4. Choice A, 6x 10^2, is not the correct answer. This reflects multiplying the starting inoculum by an incorrect number of generations (three) and forgetting lag time occurs only once. Choice B, 1.2 x10^3, is not the correct answer and reflects multiplying the initial number by the number of generations (6), not 2^6. Choice C, 1.6x 10^3, is not the correct answer and reflects forgetting lag time occurs only once and calculating only three generations (2^3). Choice D, 3.2 x 10^3, is not the correct answer and reflects incorrectly overlapping the lag period with the first generation, resulting in calculating five generations (2^5)."

      "D. Herpes zoster",
      "E. Measles virus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The specific clue to the cause of the severe encephalitis in this AIDS patient is the history of shingles, due to reactivation of the herpes zoster (varicella zoster) virus. In otherwise healthy adults, the virus (which is usually introduced to the body as a childhood case of chickenpox) remains dormant in a dorsal root ganglion only to reactivate in later life, causing a painful vesicular eruption that characteristically conforms to the distribution of a single dermatome. In AIDS patients, the virus can cause a severe multifocal encephalitis that may be resistant to acyclovir therapy. Cytomegalovirus (choice A) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but is less likely in the present patient, given his past history of shingles. Herpes simplex type-1 (choice B) and type-2 (choice C) can cause disseminated disease (including brain infection) in AIDS patients but are less likely in this patient, given his past history of shingles and the lack of response to acyclovir. Measles virus (choice E) appears to be related to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, but this condition is not specifically increased in AIDS patients."

      "I. Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins",
      "J. Tetanus toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient's wound is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the characteristic lesion described is called ecthyma gangrenosum. The Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which is responsible for the tissue damage, inhibits protein synthesis by acting on elongation factor 2 (eEF-2), with a primary target cell in the liver. The diphtheria toxin has a similar action (ADP-ribosylation of eEF-2), although its target cells are heart and nerve. Anthrax toxin (choice A) is a three-component toxin that contains a single binding component (protective antigen) and two active components. The edema factor (EF) is an adenylate cyclase that causes fluid loss from cells, and the lethal factor (LF) is an endoprotease that causes apoptosis. Botulinum toxin (choice B) is a neurotoxin that prevents neurosecretory vesicles from fusing with synaptic membranes and releasing acetylcholine. Cholera toxin (choice C) acts to increase adenylate cyclase activity by ribosylation of Gs protein. Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (choice D) is a lecithinase (phospholipase C). Escherichia coli labile toxin (choice F) works in a fashion similar to the cholera toxin (ADP-ribosylation of Gs). Pertussis toxin (choice G) causes fluid loss by ribosylating Gi protein. Shigatoxin (choice H) decreases protein synthesis by inhibiting the 60S ribosomal subunit (cleaving rRNA). Streptococcal erythrogenic toxins (choice I) act as superantigens to increase cytokine production. Tetanus toxin (choice J) is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA."

      "E. It is a motile organism"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has developed diphtheria. Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The difference between the pathogenic (toxin-producing) strain and a normal flora diphtheroid (non-toxin producing) is established using the ELEK test, shown in the image. This test detects toxin production via a precipitation reaction between toxin (from the bacteria) and antitoxin (on the filter paper strip). The white lines indicate precipitation (toxin production). Strain 1 in the image is the known toxigenic strain, showing a precipitation line. In C. diphtheriae, toxin production occurs following infection of the bacterium with a temperate phage that encodes the toxin gene (lysogenic conversion). Therefore, Strain 1, being toxigenic, is infected with this temperate phage. Episomes (choice A) are plasmids integrated into the chromosome; phage integration leads to a prophage, not an episome in this context. Free plasmid DNA (choice B) is not the source of diphtheria toxin (unlike tetanus toxin). It is not a diphtheroid (choice D) is true for the toxigenic strain 1, but C is the direct reason for its toxigenicity. A diphtheroid is a non-toxin producer (like the strains on lines 2 and 3 in the image). It is a motile organism (choice E) is incorrect; C. diphtheriae is nonmotile."

Transposons are mobile genetic elements ('jumping genes') that can carry genes, including those conferring antibiotic resistance, from one DNA molecule (e.g., chromosome) to another (e.g., plasmid) or between plasmids. The accumulation of multiple resistance genes on plasmids via transposons is a major mechanism for the development and spread of multi-drug resistance in bacteria like enterococci. Bacteriophages (choice A) and prophages (choice C) can transfer genes via transduction, sometimes including resistance genes, but transposons are key in assembling multi-drug resistance plasmids.

Examination of the lesion shows that it contains a freely mobile, matted ball of material. Examination of tissue obtained on biopsy of the wall of the lesion shows granulomatous disease, which confirms tuberculosis infection. Which of the following descriptions best represents the microscopic findings from the material inside the cavitary lesion in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arthroconidia in chains",
      "B. Hyphae with sleeves of conidia",
      "C. Hyphae branching at acute angles (45 degrees)",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of a mobile, matted ball of material within a pre-existing lung cavity (here, from tuberculosis) is characteristic of a fungus ball, or aspergilloma. This is caused by saprophytic growth of Aspergillus species, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus. Microscopically, Aspergillus is characterized by septate hyphae that branch dichotomously at acute (approximately 45-degree) angles. Choice A describes the infectious form of Coccidioides immitis. Choice B describes the environmental form of Sporothrix schenckii. Choice D describes Candida albicans. Choice E describes Zygomycetes (e.g., Mucor, Rhizopus)."

It consists of double-stranded, enveloped DNA, which replicates in the cytoplasm via a virion-associated transcriptase. This new virus would be most likely classified in which of the following families?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Hepadnavirus",

      "E. Parvovirus",
      "F. Poxvirus"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is F. The description perfectly matches the characteristics of the Poxvirus family. Poxviruses (like smallpox, vaccinia, molluscum contagiosum) are large, complex, brick-shaped viruses containing double-stranded DNA. Uniquely among DNA viruses, they replicate entirely within the cytoplasm of the host cell, using their own virally encoded enzymes, including a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (transcriptase). All other DNA viruses listed replicate primarily in the nucleus. Adenovirus (A) and Papillomavirus (D) are naked icosahedral dsDNA viruses. Hepadnavirus (B, e.g., Hepatitis B) is enveloped, icosahedral, with a partially dsDNA genome and replicates via an RNA intermediate using reverse transcriptase, primarily in the nucleus. Herpesvirus (C) is enveloped, icosahedral, dsDNA, replicating in the nucleus. Parvovirus (E) is naked, icosahedral, and uniquely has a single-stranded DNA genome, replicating in the nucleus."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The patient presents with signs and symptoms of viral encephalitis (headache, fever, confusion, neurological signs) with lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF. Given the timing (summer) and location (Mississippi), arthropod-borne viral encephalitis (transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks) is highly likely. Examples include St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile virus (both Flaviviridae, mosquito-borne), and La Crosse encephalitis (Bunyaviridae, mosquito-borne). While Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis is the most common sporadic cause, it's not typically arthropod-borne and often shows RBCs in the CSF. Aerosol (A) transmits respiratory viruses. Fecal-oral (C) transmits enteroviruses (which can cause meningitis/encephalitis but less commonly this presentation) and Hepatitis A/E. Parenteral (D) and Sexual (E) transmission are typical for viruses like HIV, HBV, HCV, which are less common causes of acute encephalitis in this context."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Despite the patient having HIV, a CD4 count of 500/uL is relatively high. At this stage, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still the most common mycobacterial pulmonary infection, even in HIV-positive individuals. M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infections (choice A) become much more common when the CD4 count drops significantly lower, typically below 100/uL or even 50/uL. It's important to note that chest x-ray findings in HIV-positive patients with TB can be atypical or even normal, especially early on. M. leprae (B) causes leprosy.

Helicobacter pylori infection is strongly associated with peptic ulcer disease (gastric and duodenal ulcers), chronic gastritis, and an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma. Perforation is a serious complication of peptic ulcers. H. pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa, aided by its production of urease, which neutralizes stomach acid locally.

Molluscum contagiosum virus is a member of the Poxvirus family, which contains double-stranded DNA genomes. Poliovirus is a Picornavirus with a positive-stranded RNA genome, but only its capsid (protein coat) was used. Therefore, the genetic material replicated and packaged into new virions will be the double-stranded DNA from the molluscum contagiosum virus. Double-stranded segmented RNA (B) is characteristic of Reoviruses. Negative-stranded RNA (C) is found in viruses like influenza, rabies, measles. Positive-stranded RNA (D) is the genome of poliovirus itself, but wasn't used here. Segmented RNA (E) is found in Orthomyxoviruses, Bunyaviruses, Arenaviruses, and Reoviruses."

Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum ('Fifth disease'), characterized by the 'slapped cheek' rash (choice E explanation implies sickle cell anemia context based on aplastic crisis). Crucially, Parvovirus B19 infects erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow. In individuals with chronic hemolytic anemias (like sickle cell disease), this infection can trigger an aplastic crisis, characterized by a sudden drop in hemoglobin and reticulocytopenia due to cessation of red blood cell production, matching the bone marrow findings.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The diagram illustrates bacterial conjugation, a process of genetic transfer that requires direct cell-to-cell contact, often mediated by a pilus. Plasmids, particularly resistance plasmids (R factors) like one conferring tetracycline resistance, are commonly transferred via conjugation from a donor (F+ or Hfr) cell to a recipient (F-) cell. This mechanism allows for the rapid spread of resistance through a bacterial population, as observed in the scenario. Generalized transduction (B) and specialized transduction (D) involve bacteriophages mediating gene transfer. Transformation (E) involves the uptake of free DNA from the environment. Homologous recombination (C) is a process of integrating transferred DNA, not the transfer mechanism itself in this case."

The lack of response to ampicillin (a cell wall synthesis inhibitor) and rapid improvement with erythromycin (a macrolide) points towards Mycoplasma pneumoniae or potentially Chlamydia pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause in young adults and is classically associated with the production of cold agglutinins (IgM antibodies that agglutinate red blood cells at 4°C) in about 65% of patients. Dieterle silver stain (B) is used for Legionella. Quellung reaction (C) identifies capsules, particularly of Streptococcus pneumoniae (which causes typical, not atypical, pneumonia).

Definitive diagnosis requires visualization of the organism in respiratory specimens (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsy). While staining methods like Gomori methenamine silver or Giemsa can be used, the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, using monoclonal antibodies against Pneumocystis antigens, is a rapid and sensitive method for identifying the organism in these specimens.

This reaction is mediated by T-lymphocytes (specifically TH1 cells) that have been previously sensitized to antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. T-cells recognize peptide antigens presented on MHC molecules. The PPD reagent contains tuberculin proteins derived from the bacterium. It is these proteins (outer surface proteins) that are processed and presented to T-cells, eliciting the inflammatory response characterized by induration.

Measles virus belongs to the Paramyxovirus family. A characteristic cytopathic effect of paramyxoviruses (including measles, mumps, RSV, parainfluenza) and herpesviruses is the formation of syncytia (multinucleated giant cells) due to fusion of infected cells. Guarnieri bodies (A) are seen in smallpox. Koilocytes (B) are seen in HPV infections. Negri bodies (C) are seen in rabies. Owl's-eye inclusions (D) are characteristic of cytomegalovirus."

    "question": "A 53-year-old woman who has diabetes mellitus comes to the employee health center for an annual examination. She has no complaints at this time. A review of her chart reveals that she is due for a few vaccinations, including the influenza A vaccine. She questions the physician about the necessity of the vaccine because she just received one a year ago. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate?",
    "options": [
      "A. Last year's influenza vaccine may be ineffective today because influenza A has a heavy polysaccharide coat",
      "B. Last year's influenza vaccine may be ineffective today because influenza A immunosuppresses the patient",
      "C. Last year's influenza vaccine may be ineffective today because influenza A kills lymphocytes",
      "D. Last year's influenza vaccine may be ineffective today because influenza A undergoes genetic drift",
      "E. Last year's influenza vaccine may be ineffective today because influenza A undergoes genetic reassortment"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended primarily because the influenza virus, particularly type A, undergoes frequent antigenic changes. Antigenic drift refers to the gradual accumulation of point mutations in the genes encoding the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). These minor changes allow the virus to evade immunity developed from previous infections or vaccinations, necessitating updated vaccines each year to match the currently circulating strains. Antigenic shift (choice E) refers to major, abrupt changes in HA or NA, often due to genetic reassortment between human and animal influenza viruses. This process leads to novel strains that can cause pandemics, but antigenic drift is the main reason for annual vaccine updates. Influenza A does not have a polysaccharide coat (A), does not primarily kill lymphocytes (C), and while it can cause complications, 'immunosuppression' (B) isn't the reason for vaccine ineffectiveness year-to-year in this context."

    "question": "A colony of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is isolated on Thayer-Martin medium. Over the course of ten generations in culture, this strain produces a homogeneous antigenic type of pilus. Lysates from a culture of N. gonorrhoeae with a different pilus type are added to the stable colonies. After overnight culture, the bacteria are cloned and their pilus expression is analyzed. In 50% of the new colonies, a new antigenic form of pilus is now expressed. Which of the following types of genetic events has most likely occurred in these cultures?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Natural transformation",
      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Specialized transduction"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is one of the bacterial species known to be naturally competent, meaning it can take up naked DNA from its environment. In this experiment, adding cell lysates (containing DNA) from a strain with a different pilus type allowed the recipient bacteria to take up this DNA and incorporate the gene for the new pilus type via homologous recombination, resulting in antigenic variation of the pili. This process is natural transformation. Conjugation (A) requires cell-to-cell contact. Generalized (B) and specialized (E) transduction require bacteriophages. Site-specific recombination (D) is involved in processes like phage integration and transposon insertion, not typically the uptake and integration of random DNA fragments from a lysate as described here for pilus variation."

      "D. No true cell wall",
      "E. Visible by darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent. The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults. The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Having both hyphae and spores (choice B) would be true of Candida, which usually causes arthritis as a rare complication of systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma do not have true cell walls (choice D) and do not usually cause septic arthritis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete that is visible only with darkfield microscopy (choice E) or direct fluorescent antibody. Secondary syphilis can (uncommonly) cause an acute arthritis, but syphilis is rare in an otherwise healthy adult."

    "options": [
      "A. Catalase",
      "B. Hemolysin",

      "D. Streptokinase",
      "E. Tetanospasmin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome. Tetanospasmin (choice E) is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani It inhibits the inhibitory mediators glycine and GABA, and promotes the rigid paralysis of tetanus.

      "A. Corynebacterium diphtheriae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D. Streptococcus pyogenes",
      "E. Streptococcus salivarius"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus , since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae. (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx, constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) | a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx, and a tonsillar exudate. Streptococcus salivarius (choice E) is a gram-positive coccus that is usually alpha-hemolytic_ It is normal flora of the oral cavity and is sometimes implicated in subacute bacterial endocarditis, but is not associated with tonsillar abscesses."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Streptococcus bovis is a group D Streptococcus. There is a significant association between S. bovis bacteremia and endocarditis with carcinoma of the colon and other colonic diseases. Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are reported to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. The group D Streptococci are distinguished by having a cell wall carbohydrate composed of glycerol teichoic acid. S. agalactiae (choice A) Is a group B Streptococcus that is the number-one cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia in the United States. S. mutans and S. sanguis (choices C and F) are viridans streptococci, which are normal flora of the oral mucosa. While they are associated with bacterial endocarditis, it is usually associated with invasive dental work and a preexisting heart valve defect.

      "D. Decreasing / Normal / No change / No change",
      "E. Undetectable / Normal / Decreasing / Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 225/mm^3, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient measured for p24 or viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases, CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood. This does not happen in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This young woman is infected with Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells. It has sterols in its membrane (choice A) is a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These are the only prokaryotes that totally lack a cell wall, but instead have sterols in their membranes. It lacks a cell wall (choice B) is also a statement that describes the mycoplasmas. These prokaryotes are devoid of a cell wall, but have sterols in their membranes. Its cell membrane contains ergosterol (choice C) is a statement that describes the fungi. The ergosterol molecule is unique to fungi, and is the target molecule for nystatin and the imidazoles.

      "D. It interferes with mitotic spindle function",
      "E. It interferes with thymidylate synthetase and DNA synthesis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans , which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test: the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-a-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-a-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the 'conazole' antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A) . This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however, this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patient's oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum. Flucytosine interferes with thymidylate synthetase (choice E). This agent is used in the treatment of cryptococcosis. It is contraindicated in HIV patients, as it may cause bone marrow suppression in those patients."

      "A. Complementation",
      "B. High mutational rate",
      "C. Phenotypic mixing",
      "D. Segmented genome",
      "E. Syncytia formation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift, or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Resistance transfer factors (R-plasmids) often acquire multiple antibiotic resistance genes through the insertion of transposons. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that insert themselves into DNA via site-specific recombination, often mediated by transposase enzymes encoded by the transposon itself. This insertion process creates characteristic flanking sequences at the insertion site, such as direct repeats or marks the ends of the transposon with inverted repeats. The rectangular blocks likely represent these flanking sequences (direct or inverted repeats) which are the result or target sites of the site-specific recombination events that inserted the transposon carrying the adjacent resistance gene(s). The transposon itself (E) is the entire mobile segment including the resistance gene. Recombinase genes (A) would be within the transposon, not usually depicted as flanking blocks for multiple insertions. Introns (B) are not found in bacteria.

The student's illness is erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), caused by Parvovirus B19, characterized by the 'slapped cheek' rash followed by a lacy, reticular rash. Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy, especially in the first or second trimester, carries a risk of fetal infection. The virus targets erythroid precursor cells, leading to severe fetal anemia and potentially aplastic crisis. This severe anemia can cause high-output heart failure, resulting in non-immune hydrops fetalis (generalized fetal edema), which can lead to fetal death. Congenital heart disease (A) is associated with Rubella. Cutaneous scarring (B) is associated with congenital Varicella. Hemolytic anemia (C) is not the primary issue, aplastic anemia is. Hydrocephalus (D) is associated with other congenital infections like toxoplasmosis or CMV, or mumps."

      "D. Site-specific recombination",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The clinical picture describes scarlet fever, which is characterized by streptococcal pharyngitis (sore throat, fever, exudate) accompanied by a characteristic sandpaper-like rash. Scarlet fever is caused by strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep) that produce streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs), also known as erythrogenic toxins. The genes encoding these toxins (like speA and speC) are carried by temperate bacteriophages. When these phages infect S. pyogenes and integrate their DNA into the bacterial chromosome (forming a prophage), the bacterium acquires the ability to produce the toxin. This phenomenon, where a bacterium acquires new properties (like toxin production) due to the presence of a prophage, is called lysogenic conversion. Conjugation (A), transformation (E), and recombination (B, D) are other mechanisms of genetic exchange or alteration but are not the specific mechanism for acquiring SPE toxin genes in this context."

      "D. Phenotypic masking",
      "E. Phenotypic mixing"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza A virus has a segmented RNA genome (8 segments). When two different strains of influenza A (like a swine H3N2 and a human H1N1) co-infect the same host cell, the RNA segments from both parent viruses can be replicated and then reassorted or 'shuffled' during packaging into new progeny virions. This can result in new combinations of genome segments, leading to viruses with novel combinations of surface antigens (like H3N1 or H1N2 in this example). This process of genetic reassortment leading to major antigenic changes is called antigenic shift (or genetic shift). It is responsible for the emergence of pandemic influenza strains. Genetic drift (B) involves minor changes due to point mutations. Complementation (A) involves sharing gene products between defective viruses. Phenotypic mixing (E) involves progeny viruses containing surface proteins from both parents but unchanged genomes. Phenotypic masking (D) involves the genome of one virus being enclosed in the capsid/envelope proteins of another."

This patient has symptoms of sepsis (fever, tachypnea) and likely Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (retractions, crackles, bilateral infiltrates) originating from a urinary source, given his history of BPH and urinary retention predisposing to UTI. The most common cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired UTIs, especially those leading to urosepsis, is Escherichia coli. E. coli is a gram-negative rod. Other common gram-negative rods causing UTIs include Klebsiella, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. Gram-negative diplococci (A) could be Neisseria or Moraxella, less common causes of urosepsis. Gram-positive cocci (C) like Staphylococcus or Enterococcus can cause UTI/urosepsis, but gram-negative rods are more frequent.

The ELEK test confirms that strain 1 is toxigenic (produces diphtheria toxin), as indicated by the precipitin lines forming where toxin diffuses from the bacterial streak and meets antitoxin diffusing from the filter paper strip. The ability of C. diphtheriae to produce diphtheria toxin is conferred by lysogenic conversion – infection with a specific temperate bacteriophage (beta-phage) that carries the tox gene. Therefore, the toxigenic strain 1 is infected with this temperate phage. Episomes (A) are integrated plasmids. Plasmids (B) are not the source of diphtheria toxin.

The presence of Anti-HBe and absence of HBeAg suggests seroconversion and lower infectivity, typical of resolving acute infection or inactive chronic state. The key finding is the absence of both HBsAg and Anti-HBs. This pattern defines the 'window period' of acute Hepatitis B infection, which occurs after HBsAg disappears from the blood but before Anti-HBs becomes detectable.

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Parvovirus B19 infection causes erythema infectiosum ('Fifth disease'), characterized by the 'slapped cheek' rash. Crucially, it infects and halts the proliferation of erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow. In individuals with underlying conditions requiring high red blood cell turnover (like sickle cell disease), this transient cessation of erythropoiesis leads to a rapid drop in hemoglobin and reticulocytes, causing an aplastic crisis. The combination of the rash and aplastic crisis is highly characteristic of Parvovirus B19 infection in this setting."

Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall (making ampicillin ineffective) and is treated with macrolides (like erythromycin), tetracyclines, or fluoroquinolones. A characteristic, though not universal, finding in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is the presence of cold agglutinins (IgM antibodies causing RBC clumping at 4°C).

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza viruses, especially type A, constantly change their surface antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) through antigenic drift. This involves the gradual accumulation of point mutations, leading to minor antigenic changes. Immunity from previous infection or vaccination may not effectively recognize these drifted strains, requiring annual updates to the vaccine formulation to match currently circulating viruses. Antigenic shift (E), caused by genetic reassortment, leads to major changes and potential pandemics, but drift is the primary driver for annual vaccine updates. Influenza has an envelope, not a polysaccharide coat (A). Options B and C are not the reasons for vaccine updates."

This DNA can then be integrated into the recipient's genome via homologous recombination, potentially altering traits like pilus antigen type. This process of uptake of naked DNA is called natural transformation. Conjugation (A) requires cell contact. Transduction (B, E) requires phages.

The patient has acute bacterial prostatitis, most commonly caused by gram-negative rods ascending from the urethra, with E. coli being the most frequent culprit. The initial and most crucial step in establishing a urinary tract infection (including prostatitis) is adherence of the bacteria to the uroepithelial cells to prevent being washed away by urine flow.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The clinical picture describes malignant external otitis, a severe, invasive infection of the external ear canal and surrounding structures (including bone), occurring predominantly in elderly diabetic patients. The most common causative agent is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is characterized as a gram-negative rod (bacillus) that is oxidase-positive and often produces characteristic blue-green pigments (pyocyanin and pyoverdin). Option A describes Haemophilus. Option B describes organisms like Shigella, Salmonella, Proteus. Option D describes Streptococcus pneumoniae or viridans group strep.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The description fits Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of opportunistic infections (pneumonia, burn infections) known for its intrinsic and acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics. A major mechanism contributing to its broad-spectrum resistance is low outer membrane permeability due to restrictive porin proteins. Mutations that further decrease the expression or alter the structure of these porins (like OprD) can significantly reduce the entry of various antibiotics (including carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides) into the cell. While Pseudomonas also utilizes other resistance mechanisms like efflux pumps, beta-lactamases (E), and target site mutations (A, C), altered porin permeability (B) is a key factor in its multi-drug resistance phenotype. Acetyltransferase (D) confers resistance mainly to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. While HIV uses CD4 (B) as its primary receptor, entry into target cells (especially macrophages and activated T-cells early in infection) requires binding to a co-receptor, most commonly CCR5. Some individuals are naturally resistant to infection with R5-tropic HIV strains (the most commonly transmitted strains) because they are homozygous for a deletion mutation (CCR5-delta32) in the gene encoding the CCR5 co-receptor. This prevents functional CCR5 from being expressed on the cell surface, blocking viral entry. Absence of CD4 would cause severe immunodeficiency. CD8 (C) is on cytotoxic T-cells. Gp120 (D) is the viral protein that binds CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4. TNF receptor (E) is involved in inflammation."

In the host's body (at 37°C), the fungus converts to its yeast form. Crucially, these yeast forms are typically found residing and multiplying intracellularly, primarily within macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Because the yeast forms are sequestered within host cells, they are not readily shed or transmitted from person to person through casual contact or respiratory droplets. The infectious forms found in the environment are the hyphae (A) bearing macroconidia (C) and microconidia (D).

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is a sexually transmitted gram-negative coccus. It is estimated that N. gonorrhoeae may express over 1 million variants of pili, resulting in the virtual absence of immunity to reinfection with this agent. The pili of this organism also are protective against phagocytosis and mediate attachment to the mucosal surfaces. The organism is the most common cause of septic arthritis in otherwise healthy, sexually active adults. The treatment is usually with ceftriaxone. The Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms that cannot make ATP (choice C) and do not usually cause septic arthritis.

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Abscesses are commonly produced by catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is one of the toxic oxygen compounds generated by the action of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes and it acts as the substrate for myeloperoxidase. Producing catalase, therefore, allows bacteria to survive longer intracellularly. Catalase-positive organisms include the staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Enterobacteriaceae. Hemolysins (choice B) refers to a variety of enzymes that act to degrade hemoglobin. These would not have a role inside the phagolysosome. Hyaluronidase (choice C) is a spreading factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes that degrades hyaluronic acid and promotes the movement of the organism through the extracellular matrix. It would not inactivate any of the intracellular killing mechanisms of phagocytes. Streptokinase (choice D) is a fibrinolytic compound produced by Streptococcus pyogenes It would not contribute to survival within the phagolysosome.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The description of the agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely Staphylococcus aureus , since it was able to ferment mannitol (as evidenced by the color change in the mannitol salt agar after incubation) and was beta-hemolytic. Other characteristics of this organism are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. Staphylococcal organisms are also notorious for formation of abscesses; this patient has an abscess in the tonsillar region. The diphtheria bacilli Corynebacterium diphtheriae. (choice A) are gram-positive, pleomorphic rods that are arranged in palisades. They are non-hemolytic and will not grow on mannitol salt agar. These organisms produce a whitish-gray pseudomembrane on the pharynx or the larynx, constitutional symptoms from toxemia are the major features of diphtheria. Epiglottitis is the most common disease of the upper respiratory tract produced by Haemophilus influenzae (choice B) | a gram-negative, encapsulated rod. It is also a common cause of otitis media in children and may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in adults. Streptococcus pyogenes (choice D) is a beta-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains, as opposed to the random, grapelike clusters of the staphylococci. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of pharyngitis, which is usually manifested by severe sore throat, fever, a beefy-red pharynx, and a tonsillar exudate.

      "E. Undetectable / Normal / Decreasing / Increasing"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Since the patient's CD4 cell count is 225/mm^3, he will soon enter the early symptomatic period during which there is generalized decline in immune function, without the presence of an AIDS-defining condition. As the number of CD4-positive cells declines further, his ability to produce any isotype of antibody other than IgM will decline, and thus antibodies to the capsid antigen (p24) will decline. Since these antibodies are the ones that keep virions out of the circulation, there will now be an increase in viral load in the patient measured for p24 or viral RNA, and virions will be found in the blood. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, decreasing CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice B) is not correct, because as CD4-positive cells decline, there is decreasing ability for isotype switching, and p24 antibodies will decline because they are IgG in isotype. Envelope antibodies will remain stable or increase slightly, not decrease. Increasing p24, virus, and RNA, stable CD4 cells, increasing p24 antibodies, and decreasing env antibodies (choice C) is not correct because in untreated cases, CD4 counts will decline consistently until death. Decreasing p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, no change in p24 antibodies, and no change in env antibodies (choice D) is not correct because untreated cases do not self-resolve, and decreasing amounts of virus constituents in the blood would indicate that the patient's condition is improving. Undetectable p24, virus, and RNA, normal CD4 cells, decreasing p24 antibodies, and increasing env antibodies (choice E) is not correct, because, again, it suggests that the patient has resolved his infection by removing all the virus constituents from the blood.

This genus of organisms is unusual in that they do not make ATP and are thus obligate intracellular parasites, and they possess a cell wall in which muramic acid is missing from the peptidoglycan. Chlamydia species utilize an elementary body to infect host cells and a reticulate body to replicate within host cells.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of oral thrush, an overgrowth of the oral cavity with Candida albicans , which is a normal flora organism that commonly causes problems in immunosuppressed patients. The image shown is that of the germ-tube test: the formation of pseudohyphae in animal serum, which is considered a definitive diagnostic for the organism. In HIV-infected individuals, oral and/or pharyngeal candidiasis infections are generally treated with clotrimazole troches or fluconazole oral tablets. Fluconazole acts as an inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-a-demethylase. In a fungus, lanosterol 14-a-demethylase functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. This is responsible for the fungistatic effect of the 'conazole' antifungals. Terbinafine blocks ergosterol synthesis (choice A) . This agent is primarily used to treat dermatophytic infections, particularly tinea unguium. The echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan (choice C). These agents are indicated for invasive candidiasis, not simple oral thrush. Caspofungin can also be used in the treatment of oral/esophageal candidiasis, however, this agent would be used only for simple oral candidiasis when therapy with fluconazole alone does not effectively treat the patient's oropharyngeal candidiasis. Griseofulvin interferes with mitotic spindle function (choice D). This agent is primarily used orally against dermatophytes, as it concentrates in the stratum corneum.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Influenza A is well known for its ability to undergo genetic shift, or reassortment of the pieces of its segmented genome. Because the genome of this RNA virus occurs in eight separate segments, random rearrangements can occur when two related viruses infect a single cell. The packaging of the progeny viruses can then become drastically changed, and pandemics can result in the population due to the sudden appearance of new antigenic types. There have been four major pandemics of influenza since 1933. Genetic shift can occur only in viruses with segmented genomes (separate pieces of RNA that can be exchanged in the progeny). There are four families of viruses with segmented genomes: Reovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, and Arenavirus. Complementation (choice A) is the process by which two related viruses that have gene defects can “complement” each other when coinfecting a cell, and thereby produce progeny by the sharing of gene products. A variation of this process happens in the case of the delta agent infecting cells coinfected with the hepatitis B virus. The genome of the delta agent is defective in its ability to capture an envelope itself, but when it exists in the same cell as the hepatitis B virus, it can use the hepatitis B envelope-capturing gene to surround itself with an envelope and complete its lifecycle. High mutational rate (choice B) refers to minor antigenic changes based on random mutations, and is a potential cause of genetic drift in virus infections. Although genetic drift due to mutational change can happen in virtually any reproducing organism, it is most common in RNA viruses. It is best described as a mechanism for causing antigenic drift in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phenotypic mixing (choice C) is the process by which two related viruses coexisting in a single cell can create a generation of progeny with components of both viruses making up their capsids. The genomes are not altered, but the capsid consists of components of both parental viruses. Syncytia formation (choice E) is the property of forming multinucleated giant cells during viral infection. Fusing one infected cell to the uninfected cell next door allows some viruses to move within the host without being exposed to immunologic products outside the cell. Syncytia formation is a common mechanism of immunologic evasion in the Herpesvirus family, in measles, mumps, and in respiratory syncytial virus infections."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes malignant otitis externa, which is a severe necrotizing infection of the external ear canal, especially in elderly diabetics. Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone and surrounding structures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also known to cause ecthyma gangrenosum, a characteristic skin lesion seen in Pseudomonas septicemia, typically presenting as a black, necrotic center with a hemorrhagic border. Erythema migrans (B) is characteristic of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). Food poisoning (C) is typically caused by other bacteria like Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, etc. Nonmycotic mycetoma (D) is caused by Actinomyces or Nocardia. Pharyngitis (E) is commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or viruses."

      "E. Transposons"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Resistance transfer factors (R-plasmids) often acquire multiple antibiotic resistance genes through the insertion of transposons. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that insert themselves into DNA via site-specific recombination, often mediated by transposase enzymes encoded by the transposon itself. This insertion process creates characteristic flanking sequences at the insertion site, such as direct repeats or marks the ends of the transposon with inverted repeats. The rectangular blocks likely represent these flanking sequences (direct or inverted repeats) which are the result or target sites of the site-specific recombination events that inserted the transposon carrying the adjacent resistance gene(s). The transposon itself (E) is the entire mobile segment including the resistance gene. Recombinase genes (A) would be within the transposon, not usually depicted as flanking blocks for multiple insertions. Introns (B) are not found in bacteria. Phage insertion points (C) relate to lysogeny, not typically transposon accumulation on plasmids."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The clinical picture describes scarlet fever, which is characterized by streptococcal pharyngitis (sore throat, fever, exudate) accompanied by a characteristic sandpaper-like rash. Scarlet fever is caused by strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep) that produce streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs), also known as erythrogenic toxins. The genes encoding these toxins (like speA and speC) are carried by temperate bacteriophages. When these phages infect S. pyogenes and integrate their DNA into the bacterial chromosome (forming a prophage), the bacterium acquires the ability to produce the toxin. This phenomenon, where a bacterium acquires new properties (like toxin production) due to the presence of a prophage, is called lysogenic conversion. Conjugation (A), transformation (E), and recombination (B, D) are other mechanisms of genetic exchange or alteration but are not the specific mechanism for acquiring SPE toxin genes in this context."

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Influenza A virus has a segmented RNA genome (8 segments). When two different strains of influenza A (like a swine H3N2 and a human H1N1) co-infect the same host cell, the RNA segments from both parent viruses can be replicated and then reassorted or 'shuffled' during packaging into new progeny virions. This can result in new combinations of genome segments, leading to viruses with novel combinations of surface antigens (like H3N1 or H1N2 in this example). This process of genetic reassortment leading to major antigenic changes is called antigenic shift (or genetic shift). It is responsible for the emergence of pandemic influenza strains. Genetic drift (B) involves minor changes due to point mutations. Complementation (A) involves sharing gene products between defective viruses. Phenotypic mixing (E) involves progeny viruses containing surface proteins from both parents but unchanged genomes. Phenotypic masking (D) involves the genome of one virus being enclosed in the capsid/envelope proteins of another."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Transposons ('jumping genes') play a crucial role in the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, including enterococci. They can move resistance genes between the chromosome and plasmids, or between different plasmids. Plasmids containing multiple resistance genes, often assembled via transposons, can then be transferred rapidly between bacteria (e.g., by conjugation). While bacteriophages (A, C) can transfer resistance genes via transduction, transposons are key facilitators in accumulating multiple resistances onto mobile elements like plasmids. Exogenotes (B) are just pieces of transferred DNA. Restriction enzymes (D) are tools used in DNA manipulation but not the primary mechanism of acquiring resistance."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Parvovirus B19 infection causes erythema infectiosum ('Fifth disease'), characterized by the 'slapped cheek' rash. Crucially, it infects and halts the proliferation of erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow. In individuals with underlying conditions requiring high red blood cell turnover (like sickle cell disease), this transient cessation of erythropoiesis leads to a rapid drop in hemoglobin and reticulocytes, causing an aplastic crisis.

Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall (making ampicillin ineffective) and is treated with macrolides (like erythromycin), tetracyclines, or fluoroquinolones. A characteristic, though not universal, finding in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is the presence of cold agglutinins (IgM antibodies causing RBC clumping at 4°C).

This involves the gradual accumulation of point mutations, leading to minor antigenic changes. Immunity from previous infection or vaccination may not effectively recognize these drifted strains, requiring annual updates to the vaccine formulation to match currently circulating viruses.

The etiologic agents are usually the same as those that produce urinary tract infection (UTI), and include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus. The most common cause of UTI in the United States is E. coli. The uropathogenic strains all possess pilus adhesins such as pyelonephritis-associated pili. Other adhesins that promote adherence to the urinary tract mucosa include the colonization factor antigens (CFA/I-III), aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF/I, III), bundle-forming pili, intimin, invasion plasmid antigen protein, and Dr fimbriae. Endotoxin (choice A) is produced by all gram-negative bacteria and is an important cause of pathology when bacteremia occurs. It is not, however, believed to be the most important cause of pathogenesis in uropathogenic organisms. Flagellae (choice B) allow uropathogens to move against the flow of urine to infect the urinary bladder and prostate, as in this case. Although motility is an important feature in this pathogenesis, it is not the most important pathogenic feature of these organisms. Hemolysin HlyA (choice C) is produced by uropathogenic E. coli and is involved in the pathogenesis, but it is not the most important means of pathogenesis. Opa proteins (choice D) are the opacity proteins found in the outer membrane of Neisseria gonorrhoeae that mediate adherence and undergo antigenic variation. Although N. gonorrhoeae can cause urethritis and prostatitis, it is a gram-negative coccus. Toxins Stx-1 and Stx-2 (choice F) are Shiga toxins produced by E. coli. They are clearly important in the etiology of gastrointestinal disease, producing the fluid loss that characterizes these conditions, but these toxins are not known to play a role in the pathology of urinary tract infections."

      "E. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is a case of Reiter syndrome (reactive arthritis). Patients typically present with the acute onset of arthritis (usually asymmetric and additive), with involvement of new joints occurring over a period of a few days to 2 weeks. Joints of the lower extremities are the most commonly involved, but wrists and fingers can also be affected. Dactylitis ('sausage digit'), a diffuse swelling of a solitary finger or toe, is a distinctive feature of Reiter arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Tendinitis and fasciitis are common. Spinal pain and low back pain are common. Conjunctivitis, urethritis, diarrhea, and skin lesions are also associated with Reiter syndrome. Up to 75% of patients are HLA-B27-positive. Microorganisms that can trigger Reiter syndrome include Shigella sp., Salmonella sp., Yersinia sp., Campylobacter jejuni, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Most patients are younger males. Borrelia burgdorferi (choice A) is the cause of Lyme disease. Untreated infections are associated with development of arthritis, which appears to be immune complex-mediated. Epstein-Barr virus infection (choice C) has been implicated as an arthritogenic microbial antigen that may be involved in the initiation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hyperuricemia (choice D) is a precursor fo the formation of gout. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (choice E) may result in septic arthritis following hematogenous spread."

    "options": [
      "A. Intracellular multiplication in the brush border",
      "B. Invasion into the submucosa",
      "C. Stimulation of neutrophilic infiltrate",
      "D. Toxin inactivates the 60S ribosomal subunit",
      "E. Toxin ribosylates Gs"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient has cryptosporidiosis. The causative protozoan, most often Cryptosporidium parvum, infects the brush border of the small intestine. Although the disease is usually self-limited in healthy individuals, in AIDS patients it can cause severe diarrhea with fluid loss. The mechanism of causation of diarrhea is through the direct lysis of cells of the brush border as the intracellular parasites multiply there. The diarrhea may continue persistently or intermittently until the patient's death. Stool concentration techniques increase the chance of identifying the characteristic acid-fast oocysts in stool. Invasion into the submucosa (choice B) is observed with organisms such as Entamoeba histolytica and Shigella dysenteriae, among others. Invasive organisms cause diarrhea that is bloody and filled with neutrophils. Stimulation of neutrophilic infiltrate (choice C) is also a finding in invasive organisms because neutrophils are attracted to the area of bowel wall destruction. Intracellular organisms such as Cryptosporidium are not major attractors of neutrophils. Toxins that inactivate the 60S ribosomal subunit (choice D) include the Shiga toxin of Shigella dysenteriae and the verotoxin of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Most intracellular parasites such as Cryptosporidium do not produce exotoxins. A toxin that ribosylates Gs (choice E) is produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Cryptosporidium is not known to produce any exotoxins."

    "options": [
      "A. Anopheles mosquitoes",
      "B. Bird droppings",
      "C. Cooling systems",
      "D. Poorly cooked pork",
      "E. Rodent droppings"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Clues to the correct answer are the underlying disease (AIDS), which predisposes to opportunistic infections, and the MRI appearance of the lesion. A ring-enhancing lesion is a mass that contains a rim of contrast enhancement (bright signal on MRI) surrounding a dark core that corresponds to central necrosis. Ring-enhancing lesions in the brain of an AIDS patient are often due to cerebral toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan that infects humans who ingest the oocysts from cat feces or incompletely cooked lamb or pork. Although the cat is the necessary definitive host that keeps the parasite in nature, the most common source of infection with this parasite in the United States is the ingestion of poorly cooked pork. (In Europe, it is the beef supply that is more commonly the source.) Only immunosuppressed patients and fetuses are vulnerable to severe infection. In the fetus, toxoplasmosis causes extensive damage to brain parenchyma and retina. Toxoplasmosis associated with AIDS manifests with necrotizing lesions surrounded by chronic inflammation. In AIDS, the most frequent causes of a ring-enhancing lesion are primary brain lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. Anopheles mosquitoes (choice A) transmit malaria parasites. Cerebral malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum which causes sludging of infected red blood cells in the small cerebral capillaries. Vascular occlusion ensues, resulting in numerous small infarcts. Bird droppings (choice B) represent the vehicle of infection for two of the most common opportunistic fungal infections affecting immunocompromised patients: cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis. Cryptococcus neoformans causes meningoencephalitis, not intracerebral necrotic lesions. Histoplasma capsulatum rarely affects the brain. These fungi can be visualized in tissue sections by silver stains. Cooling systems (choice C) may harbor Legionella pneumophila, spreading the bacteria in aerosolized form. L. pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that causes Legionnaire disease, a fatal form of pneumonia that first appeared in participants at a meeting of the American Legion. It has been reported in immunocompromised patients as well. Rodent droppings (choice E) are the vehicle for hantavirus, which causes a fatal respiratory illness and is endemic to the desert Southwestern part of the United States."

      "E. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient most likely has herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. HSV-1 is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis in the United States, accounting for approximately 10% to 20% of the 20,000 viral encephalitis cases that occur annually. Viral encephalitis is characterized by elevated lymphocytes and erythrocytes in the CSF. HSV-1 encephalitis has a propensity for the temporal lobes of the brain. Other types of viral encephalitis typically affect older patients, occur in the summer months (because of mosquito transmission), and have no particular association to regions of the brain. Cowdry type A inclusions are intranuclear viral inclusion bodies that may be found in both neurons and glia and are characteristic of herpes simplex infection. The presence of both distinct nuclear and ill-defined cytoplasmic inclusions (choice A) specifically suggests cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV infection of the brain characteristically occurs in severely immunosuppressed patients. Extracellular spirochetes (choice C) can sometimes be demonstrated in patients with neuroborreliosis (Lyme disease) and neurosyphilis. Greatly enlarged oligodendrocyte nuclei with glassy amphophilic viral inclusions (choice D) are a feature of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JC virus. Microglial nodules containing multinucleated giant cells (choice E) are characteristic of chronic HIV encephalitis."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Patients with AIDS are prone to a variety of opportunistic infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia represents one of the most common initial presentations. This organism is a ubiquitous atypical fungus that may cause a life-threatening acute interstitial pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. P. jirovecii appears as a cystlike organism with a characteristic cup shape that has been likened to a 'crushed tennis ball.' Methenamine silver staining allows its identification in bronchoalveolar lavage. A frothy exudate filling the alveolar cavities is a characteristic finding in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia. Pneumocystis has been classified as a fungus by ribosomal RNA analysis, but it is an unusual member of the group, residing primarily extracellularly in the alveoli. A gram-positive, catalase-positive coccus (choice A) describes Staphylococcus. An encapsulated monomorphic fungus (choice B) describes Cryptococcus.

    "options": ["A. A", "B. B", "C. C", "D. D", "E. E", "F. F", "G. G"],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. In the bacterial growth curve, rapid exponential growth occurs during the log (or logarithmic growth) phase. Within this period, the generation time equals the time it takes for one cell to divide into two. Beta-lactam drugs act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. In a bacterial culture, cell wall synthesis will occur at a maximal rate during the period of exponential growth, which is marked on the graph by the letter C. The lag phase (choice A) is the initial phase of a bacterial culture during which there is no increase in cell number. Cells in a culture at this stage are activating enzymes necessary for metabolism, but are not undergoing cell wall synthesis. Choice B indicates the initial phase of bacterial multiplication, when cell division has not yet reached a maximum. Although cell wall synthesis would indeed make such cells sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics, it is not the period of maximum sensitivity. Choice D indicates the phase of the bacterial growth curve when toxic metabolic products begin to accumulate and nutrient levels begin to be insufficient to support continued growth. New cell wall synthesis would begin to fall at this point. The stationary phase (choice E) is a period of the bacterial growth curve when the number of bacteria dividing in the culture equals the number of cells dying. This would not be a period of intense cell wall synthesis. The decline (choice F) and death (choice G) phases of the bacterial growth curve are periods when bacteria are dying more rapidly than they are dividing. Cell wall synthesis would be minimal."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal amebic parasite that can cause relatively mild diarrhea or can behave more aggressively, causing dysentery (bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain and dehydration), peritonitis, or liver abscess formation (such as this patient has). Treatment is generally administered as soon as the diagnosis is made. Metronidazole is the drug of choice. Upon successful completion of metronidazole therapy, a “luminal agent” such as paromomycin or iodoquinol is administered to completely eradicate any remaining gastrointestinal tract infection. The trophozoite of E. histolytica, which is shown in image D, is identified by the distinctive 'cart-wheel' distribution of chromatin in the nucleus and the evidence of ingested red blood cells. Toxoplasma gondii (choice A) is a cause of encephalitis in the immunocompromised. Fasciola hepatica (choice B) is the sheep liver fluke. Clonorchis sinensis (choice C) is the Chinese liver fluke.

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient has malignant external otitis, which is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of self-limited external otitis. It may, however, penetrate the epithelium and invade the underlying soft tissue, cartilage and bone, thus leading to osteomyelitis and cranial nerve palsies. The presenting symptoms include ear pain and discharge, hearing loss, and facial nerve paralysis. Abnormalities of the external ear canal are present. A CT scan may reveal bony erosions and soft-tissue swelling. Cultures will isolate the organism. Treatment includes antibiotics and surgical debridement. Malignant external otitis is most common in elderly diabetic patients. Pseudomonas is a genus of gram-negative bacilli that are oxidase-positive, aerobic, and produce blue-green pigments. Other diseases caused by Pseudomonas include septicemia, wound or burn infections, urinary tract infections in catheterized patients, and life-threatening pneumonias in cystic fibrosis patients.

      "E. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very common opportunist in burn patients, in whom it classically causes secondary wound infections and septicemia. It may also cause cystitis in patients with urinary catheters, and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. The organism is found in water and usually gains access to the body as a contaminant. Pseudomonas is resistant to many antibiotics, and mutates to even more resistant strains during therapy. The most important means of resistance is through the mutation of a porin protein that restricts the flow of many antibiotics into the cell. Mutation of a penicillin-binding protein (choice A) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance exhibited by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mutation of a topoisomerase (choice C) is a chromosomally mediated mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin exhibited by Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli. Plasmid-mediated acetyltransferase production (choice D) is a mechanism exhibited by Klebsiella and Enterobacter against gentamicin, and by Salmonella against chloramphenicol. Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production (choice E) is expressed in Pseudomonas and contributes to resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, but altered porin proteins contribute more broadly."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal infection that is acquired through inhalation of soil or dust that contains the organism's spores (microconidia). Within the body, Histoplasma capsulatum converts to tiny yeast forms (choice E) and is characteristically found intracellularly, particularly within cells of the reticuloendothelial system (macrophages). This intracellular location prevents the organism from being readily shed in respiratory secretions or other bodily fluids in a form that can easily transmit to another person through casual contact. The infectious forms found in the environment are the hyphae (A) bearing macroconidia (C) and microconidia (D)."

The characteristic white plaques can be scraped off. While often diagnosed clinically, confirmation can be done by microscopic examination of scrapings (showing yeasts and pseudohyphae) or by the germ-tube test. The germ-tube test involves incubating Candida in serum; C. albicans (the most common species) typically forms germ tubes (short hyphal extensions) within a few hours, which is considered diagnostic.

Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum. Tertiary syphilis (including neurosyphilis) is preceded by primary syphilis (painless chancre) and secondary syphilis. Secondary syphilis is characterized by systemic symptoms and a diffuse maculopapular rash, often copper-colored or 'bronzing', which characteristically involves the palms and soles. This rash (C) would likely be in the patient's history. Ingestion of poorly cooked fish (A) can lead to Diphyllobothrium latum infection causing B12 deficiency and similar neurological symptoms (subacute combined degeneration), but CBC would show megaloblastic anemia.

Of the two, Neisseria is the only one that would produce a neutrophilic discharge containing gram-negative diplococci. The most important mechanism of pathogenesis for N. gonorrhoeae is the possession of pili. In this infection, the pili promote adherence to the mucosa and protection from phagocytosis, and undergo antigenic variation. Beta-hemolysins (choice A) are not involved in neisserial pathogenesis.

All children born to HIV-positive mothers are born with positive ELISA and Western blot results. Only 20% of children born to infected mothers are actually infected with the virus, however, and it is not possible to diagnose an in utero infection using these tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral cultures on tissues from the infant are necessary to distinguish if the neonate has been infected. It is not correct to say that both mother and child have been infected (A) or that the infant is definitively infected (C).

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The patient has herpes simplex genital infection. Acyclovir (and related drugs like valacyclovir, famciclovir) is the standard treatment. These drugs are nucleoside analogs that, after phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase and then host kinases, are incorporated into the growing viral DNA chain by the viral DNA polymerase. Because they lack the 3'-hydroxyl group, they cause chain termination, thus inhibiting viral DNA replication by blocking the viral DNA polymerase. Adsorption (A) blocked by entry inhibitors. Packaging/assembly (C) by protease inhibitors. Release (D) by neuraminidase inhibitors. Uncoating (E) by amantadine."

Secondary syphilis is identified by the finding of a maculopapular, bronzing rash that covers the entire body, including mucous membranes and the skin of the palms and soles. Condylomata lata may also be present. The best initial screening test for secondary syphilis is a nontreponemal serologic test such as the VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) or RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin).

Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A, B, Ba, and C) causes trachoma, a chronic conjunctival and corneal infection endemic in areas like parts of Africa, leading to scarring, entropion, trichiasis, corneal opacity (pannus), and blindness. Diagnosis involves finding characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in conjunctival scrapings (these inclusions contain glycogen and stain with iodine). Chlamydia has a biphasic life cycle: the infectious, extracellular Elementary Body (EB) enters the cell, transforms into the larger, metabolically active, replicating Reticulate Body (RB) within the inclusion. RBs divide and then reorganize back into EBs, which are released to infect new cells. For laboratory isolation in cell culture, the organism grows as the intracellular Reticulate Body. Gram-neg diplococci (B)=Neisseria. Gram-pos cocci (C)=Staph/Strep. Naked DNA virus (D)=Adenovirus."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child has infant botulism ('floppy-baby syndrome'), caused by ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores (often from honey), germination in the gut, and production of botulinum neurotoxin. This toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking acetylcholine release. The genes for several types of botulinum toxin (e.g., types C, D) are encoded within the genome of specific lysogenic bacteriophages that infect C. botulinum. This acquisition of toxin production via phage infection is an example of lysogenic conversion. Other toxins encoded this way include cholera, Shiga, erythrogenic, and diphtheria toxins. Some botulinum toxins are plasmid (D) or chromosomally (A) encoded."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This is a classic example of recurrent genital herpes infection, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), usually type 2 (HSV-2) but sometimes HSV-1. After the initial infection, HSV travels via retrograde axonal transport up the sensory nerves supplying the genital region and establishes lifelong latency in the corresponding sensory ganglia. For the genital area, these are the sacral ganglia (specifically, dorsal root ganglia of S2-S5 spinal nerves). Reactivation from these ganglia leads to recurrent outbreaks of vesicles/ulcers in the genital area. B cells (A) = EBV latency. Mononuclear cells (B) = CMV latency. Dorsal root ganglia (C) is general term, but specifically VZV latency. Trigeminal ganglia (E) = HSV-1 latency (oral/facial)."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This is shingles, caused by reactivation of Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), a herpesvirus. Herpesviruses are double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses. They replicate in the nucleus and utilize the host cell's machinery (primarily RNA polymerase II) to transcribe their dsDNA genome into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into viral proteins in the cytoplasm. Direct translation (A, G) applies to positive-sense RNA viruses. dsDNA intermediate (B) and transcription from proviral DNA (F) apply to Retroviruses. Producing RNA intermediates (C, D) applies to RNA viruses for replication/transcription."

This patient has signs and symptoms highly suggestive of secondary syphilis, including the characteristic diffuse maculopapular rash involving palms and soles. The appropriate initial serological screening test for syphilis is a nontreponemal test, such as the VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) or RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin). These tests detect antibodies against cardiolipin-lecithin-cholesterol antigens released from damaged host cells and potentially from the spirochete itself. If the VDRL/RPR is reactive, a specific treponemal test (like FTA-ABS or TP-PA) is performed for confirmation. Darkfield microscopy (A) is used for primary chancres. ELISA (B) is non-specific here.

Haemophilus species are fastidious gram-negative coccobacilli requiring two growth factors found in blood: factor X (hematin) and factor V (NAD). Standard blood agar contains factor X within RBCs but factor V is intracellular and NADases in the blood destroy it. Haemophilus won't grow unless these factors are supplied. Heating blood agar (making chocolate agar) releases both factors. Alternatively, Haemophilus can be grown on standard blood agar if it is cross-streaked with Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus lyses the RBCs (releasing X) and secretes factor V (NAD), allowing Haemophilus to grow as 'satellite' colonies around the S. aureus streak. Antibiotics (A) for selective media.

This patient has signs and symptoms classic for acute infective endocarditis, likely involving the right side of the heart given the tricuspid valve damage and pulmonary infiltrates (suggesting septic pulmonary emboli). Fever, new murmur, and signs of embolization (conjunctival petechiae, skin manifestations like bruising/Janeway lesions/Osler nodes) are characteristic. Endocarditis involving the tricuspid valve is most commonly associated with intravenous drug use, often caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Congenital heart disease (B) is a risk factor. Rheumatic fever (C) typically affects left-sided valves. RA (D) is unrelated. SLE (E) causes Libman-Sacks endocarditis (non-infective)."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most common bacterial causes of acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Even with vaccination against S. pneumoniae (PCV vaccines), non-vaccine serotypes remain a leading cause. The polysaccharide capsule is the major virulence factor for S. pneumoniae, conferring resistance to phagocytosis. While pneumolysin (E) and adhesins (C, D) contribute, the capsule is critical for invasiveness. LPS (B) is found only in Gram-negative bacteria (like H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis)."

The clinical presentation describes severe chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, conduction abnormalities like RBBB) in a young person from an endemic area (Brazil). Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The vector that transmits T. cruzi to humans is the reduviid bug (also known as the 'kissing bug' or triatomine bug), which defecates parasite-containing feces near its bite site.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The rapid and efficient transfer of resistance to multiple antibiotics to essentially the entire recipient population strongly suggests the transfer of a conjugative plasmid (an R-factor) carrying genes for resistance to all these antibiotics. Conjugation allows for high-frequency transfer of plasmids between bacteria in direct contact. Hfr transfer (A) involves chromosomal genes and is usually incomplete and less efficient for multiple traits. Transduction (B, C) and transformation (D) are generally less efficient mechanisms for transferring large blocks of resistance genes to an entire population this quickly."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The rash shown is herpes zoster (shingles), characterized by a unilateral vesicular eruption along a dermatome. Shingles results from the reactivation of latent Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) residing in sensory ganglia following a prior episode of chickenpox. While unusual in healthy children, it can occur, particularly if primary chickenpox infection occurred very early in life (e.g., in infancy, possibly modified by maternal antibodies). The MMR vaccine contains live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella viruses, not VZV, so it cannot directly cause shingles (ruling out D and E). Exposure to chickenpox (B) or shingles (C) in a susceptible individual causes chickenpox, not shingles. Therefore, reactivation of the child's own latent VZV is the most plausible explanation, potentially triggered by non-specific immune stimulation from the recent MMR vaccine or occurring coincidentally."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A, B, Ba, and C) causes trachoma, a chronic follicular conjunctivitis endemic in developing countries that leads to scarring, entropion (inward turning of eyelid), trichiasis (inward turning eyelashes), corneal abrasion, pannus formation (vascularization/scarring of cornea), and blindness. Diagnosis involves finding characteristic intracytoplasmic glycogen-containing inclusion bodies (which stain with iodine or Giemsa) in conjunctival epithelial cells. Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium with a unique developmental cycle. The infectious form is the Elementary Body (EB), which enters the host cell. Inside the cell, the EB transforms into the larger, metabolically active Reticulate Body (RB), which replicates by binary fission within the inclusion vacuole. When grown in cell culture for diagnosis or research, the organism exists and replicates as the Reticulate Body. Gram-neg diplococcus (B)=Neisseria. Gram-pos coccus (C)=Staph/Strep.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This is likely impetigo, characterized by 'honey-crusted' or golden-brown crusted lesions often starting as vesicles. The two main bacterial causes are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Both are Gram-positive cocci (so D is not the *best* test to differentiate genera). The key test to differentiate the genus Staphylococcus from Streptococcus is the catalase test. Staphylococci are catalase-positive, while Streptococci are catalase-negative. CAMP test (A) identifies Group B Strep. ELEK test (C) identifies toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Oxidase test (E) identifies Neisseria, Pseudomonas, etc."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The patient has progressed from cystitis to pyelonephritis and urosepsis with septic shock (fever, flank pain, hypotension). The blood culture grew a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacillus, most likely E. coli. Septic shock caused by gram-negative bacteria is primarily mediated by endotoxin, which is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the outer membrane. The toxic moiety of LPS is Lipid A. Lipid A triggers massive release of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) from macrophages, leading to fever, vasodilation, hypotension, DIC, and shock. Common core (A) and O-specific polysaccharide (D) are parts of LPS but less directly toxic than Lipid A. Lecithinase (B) is C. perfringens toxin. Peptidoglycan (E) is in cell walls but Lipid A is the key endotoxin component."

E. coli is a gram-negative rod that ferments lactose (producing pink colonies on MacConkey agar). It is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis and sepsis, often acquired during passage through the birth canal. The most critical virulence factor for strains causing neonatal meningitis and invasive disease is the K1 polysaccharide capsule. This capsule confers resistance to phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing, allowing the bacteria to invade the bloodstream and CNS. Beta hemolysis (A), exotoxins (C), and motility (E) are virulence factors for other types of E. coli infections (UTI, diarrhea) but less critical for neonatal invasive disease.

The patient's symptoms (mono-like illness) and occupation (veterinary student - potential exposure to cats) suggest acute toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Congenital transmission can occur if the mother acquires a primary infection during pregnancy. The consequences depend on the timing of infection. First-trimester infection, while less common, carries the highest risk of severe fetal damage, including potentially fatal necrotizing encephalitis, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, and disseminated disease. Later infections are more common but usually less severe, often leading to retinochoroiditis (E) or asymptomatic infection at birth. Hydrops fetalis (A) is classic for Parvovirus B19.

      "E. Viral hemagglutinin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The disease is mumps, caused by a paramyxovirus. Paramyxoviruses (like mumps, measles, RSV) characteristically spread from cell to cell via fusion of infected cell membranes with neighboring uninfected cells, forming multinucleated giant cells called syncytia. This cell-to-cell spread allows the virus to evade extracellular host defenses, particularly neutralizing antibodies circulating in the blood or tissue fluid. Therefore, cell-mediated immunity (killing of infected cells) becomes crucial for clearing the infection, and antibody-mediated immunity is less effective for eliminating established infection, although important for preventing initial infection. Mumps has only one major serotype (A). Negative-sense genome (B) relates to replication strategy. Respiratory spread (C) is mode of transmission. Hemagglutinin (E) is a surface protein but doesn't inherently prevent antibody action if accessible."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The mechanism involving transfer of bacterial DNA from cell to cell using a lytic phage as a vector is called generalized transduction. During the lytic cycle, the phage replication and assembly process occasionally leads to accidental packaging of random fragments of the host bacterial chromosome (including, potentially, an ampicillin resistance gene) into a phage head instead of the phage genome. This defective phage particle can then inject the bacterial DNA into a new host cell. If this DNA is incorporated by homologous recombination (D), the recipient cell acquires the trait (ampicillin resistance). Since only bacterial DNA is transferred, no viral lysis occurs in the recipient. Conjugation (A, C) requires cell contact. Specialized transduction (F) involves temperate phages and specific genes near the integration site. Transformation (G) involves uptake of free DNA."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The description fits Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive cocci in clusters, beta-hemolytic, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive). A key mechanism S. aureus uses to evade phagocytosis is Protein A. Protein A is a surface protein that binds to the Fc region of IgG antibodies. This incorrect orientation (binding 'backwards') prevents the Fab region from binding to the bacterium and interferes with opsonization via Fc receptors on phagocytes. Capsules (A) are antiphagocytic but less consistently the primary mechanism for S. aureus compared to Protein A. Fimbriae (B) are for adherence. IgA protease (C) degrades IgA.

Contaminated poultry or poultry products are responsible for more than 50% of all infections.\nCarriers (choice A) are not known to occur with Campylobacter, and are best known with Salmonella typhi - Typhoid fever is an enteric fever that presents with fever, lymphadenopathy and constipation.\nCustard and potato-salad dishes (choice B) would be the most likely source if the agent was Staphylococcus aureus, but this would have had an onset of 2 hours, and a gram-positive coccus would have been the cause.\nMilk and cream (choice C) might contain Listeria or Mycobacterium bovis, but Listeria is a gram-positive rod and Mycobacterium is an acid-fast rod. Both may cause a minor gastroenteritis in healthy adults but would be unlikely to present with blood in the stool.\nPoorly canned green vegetables (choice D) are the usual source of Clostridium botulinum which would cause a flaccid paralysis. Clostridium is a genus of gram-positive rods.\nPoorly washed salad greens (choice E) could be sources of infection with multiple agents such as Escherichia coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella, or Shigella. The E coli strains which cause non-bloody diarrhea are usually associated with travel out of the home country (traveler's diarrhea). E coli is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase-negative. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that does not occur commonly in the United States but instead requires travel to a tropical country, and Salmonella and Shigella would be more likely to cause frankly bloody stools. Both are gram-negative rods that are oxidase-negative.\nRare red meat dishes (choice G) would be good sources for Escherichia coli or Trichinella spiralis. E.coli is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative rod and Trichinella is a nematode. The serotype of E coli associated with rare meat dishes in the United States causes bloody diarrhea without leukocytes. Trichinosis causes myalgia, fever, eosinophilia, splinter hemorrhages and periorbital edema.\nRice dishes (choice H) are most frequently incriminated in the transmission of Bacillus cereus which has a 1-to-2-hour onset of vomiting followed by diarrhea. Bacillus is a genus of gram-positive rods.\nSmoked fish (choice I) is a common source of Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, spore-forming rod that would produce a flaccid paralysis.\nSoft cheeses (choice J) are a common source of Listeria monocytogenes which is a gram-positive rod that causes mild gastroenteritis."

    "question": "A healthy 32-year-old primigravid woman at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal examination. She states that she emigrated from Southeast Asia and that three years ago, she had fatigue, nausea, anorexia, jaundice, joint pains, and generalized skin lesions that slowly disappeared. Which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered to investigate the patient's past illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibody",
      "B. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) Ig antibody",
      "C. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)",
      "D. IgM antibody to HBcAg",
      "E. IgM antibody to HBsAg"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical signs suggest that this woman had hepatitis B three years ago, and the fact that she is now feeling better also suggests that she recovered from this infection. Since she is pregnant, it is necessary to find out if she still has the agent in her liver (chronic hepatitis B infection) by performing a test for HBsAg. This test will be negative if she has completely recovered from the disease, but it will be positive if she is a chronic carrier.\nThe clinical signs of the disease she had 3 years ago do not match those of CMV infection (choice A), and CMV does not produce chronic infection.\nQuantitation of HAV IgM antibody (choice B) would be of no value at this time.\nMeasurement of IgM antibody to HBcAg (choice D) would be of no value at this time. This IgM antibody is positive in acute fulminant hepatitis B, but would no longer be positive in this case.\nExamination of IgM antibody to HBsAg (choice E) would be of no value at this time. This IgM antibody would be formed early during the recovery from acute hepatitis B, and would class-switch to IgG later on in the disease."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man is struck by a car and sustains crush injuries to both legs. Two days later, he develops a severe infection of the legs. Physical examination shows crepitus of the tissue of the legs. An x-ray of the legs shows radiolucent pockets in the soft tissues. Which of the following toxins produced by the most likely causal organism is responsible for these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha toxin",
      "B. Endotoxin",
      "C. Enterotoxin",
      "D. Meurotoxin",
      "E. Superantigen toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The disease described is gas gangrene, which is caused by the spore-forming anaerobe Clostridium perfringens and other closely related species. These very dangerous bacteria particularly like to grow in necrotic vascular tissue, and they produce a variety of destructive enzymes and toxins. The toxin produced by C perfringens that is most strongly associated with myonecrosis is the alpha toxin, which is a lecithinase (phospholipase C) that lyses erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells. This toxin mediates massive hemolysis, increased vascular permeability and bleeding, hepatotoxicity, bradycardia, and hypotension. In the laboratory, the action of the lecithinase can be observed in Nagler's reaction, in which strains of C. perfringens will lyse the lecithin in egg-yolk agar.\nEndotoxin (choice B) is lipopolysaccharide and is not found on gram-positive organisms such as Clostridium.\nEnterotoxins (choice C) are produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including C perfringens, but the vignette is clearly specific for myonecrosis and not gastroenteritis.\nNeurotoxins (choice D) are produced by other members of the genera Clostridium (C. tetanus and C. botulinum), but not by C perfringens.\nSuperantigen toxin (choice E) is specific for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and the pyrogenic exotoxins of Streptococcus pyogenes. These exotoxins cause fever, petechial rash, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy."

    "question": "A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a rash that appeared 2 days ago. Physical examination shows multiple umbilicated, flesh-colored papules on the trunk. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. It captures a nuclear membrane envelope",
      "B. It replicates in the cytoplasm",
      "C. It replicates in the nucleus",
      "D. It utilizes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase",
      "E. It utilizes reverse transcriptase"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The lesions are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum, a typically benign and self-limited condition caused by a poxvirus. The disease can be transmitted either sexually or through direct nonsexual contact. Patients with advanced HIV infection may develop a severe, generalized, and persistent eruption, often involving the face and upper body. Molluscum contagiosum virus is a poxvirus that reproduces in the cytoplasm and produces intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies.\nCapturing a nuclear membrane envelope (choice A) and replication in the nucleus (choice C) are characteristics of Herpesviridae. This family includes herpes simplex 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster, herpes 6, and herpes 8. None of these agents cause umbilicated warts, although rashes may occur. Herpes simplex causes vesicular lesions on the mucosae, and varicella causes an asynchronous pruritic rash (chickenpox) or a unilateral vesicular rash that follows a dermatome (shingles).\nUtilization of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (choice D) is characteristic of all RNA viruses.\nUtilization of reverse transcriptase (choice E) is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B Virus. Reverse transcriptase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vaginal itching and discharge. Pelvic examination shows abundant white, lumpy material in the vagina. Examination of the discharge under a microscope shows fungal hyphae and yeast forms. Which of the following is most likely to predispose the patient to this condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Crohn disease",
      "B. Diabetes mellitus",
      "C. Disseminated gonococcal infection",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has vulvovaginitis secondary to Candida infection. The condition is characterized by itching and soreness, pain on intercourse, finding of pseudohyphae in vaginal secretions, and absence of a particular odor. Predisposing factors include a high vaginal pH, diabetes, and use of antibiotics. The increased vulnerability in diabetes may reflect increased glucose concentrations in vaginal secretions and relative immunosuppression.\nCrohn disease (choice A) can predispose for fistulas involving the vagina, rather than vulvovaginitis.\nDissemination of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (choice C) can cause septic arthritis. The discharge of gonorrhea is leukorrheic and will contain neutrophils full of gram-negative diplococci.\nNeither rheumatoid arthritis (choice D) nor systemic lupus erythematosus (choice E) is specifically associated with Candida vulvovaginitis."

    "options": [
      "A. Ground beef",
      "B. Poultry",
      "C. Rice",
      "D. Salad greens",
      "E. Vacuum-packed fish"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This is a typical presentation of botulism, which is caused by the preformed toxin of Clostridium botulinum. Patients develop a progressive flaccid paralysis that can lead to death if the respiratory system is not adequately supported. Mentation is intact in these patients, and they do not exhibit sensory changes except for those related to failure of extraocular and intraocular muscles (e.g., diplopia, cycloplegia). The most common food sources implicated in botulism are canned alkaline vegetables and preserved fish. Since the genus Clostridium is anaerobic, materials packaged in the absence of oxygen will allow germination of the spores and the production of the toxin. Treatment is supportive. An antitoxin is available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) via state Health Departments, but may not be obtained early enough to be helpful. Most patients recover from food-borne botulism without any sequelae.\nGround beef (choice A) is often implicated in transmission of Escherichia coli but is not involved in adult botulism.\nPoultry (choice B) is a common source of food poisoning caused by Campylobacter and Salmonella but is not a source of adult botulism.\nRice (choice C) is a food often implicated in Bacillus cereus food poisoning, but not in adult botulism.\nSalad greens (choice D) are a source of foodborne illness in many tropical countries, as well as of Escherichia coli in the U.S., but are not implicated in the transmission of adult botulism."

Physical examination shows bilateral tenderness and swelling of the wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints. The pain remits and she feels better in seven days. Which of the following illnesses did a student in her classroom most likely have?",
    "options": [
      "A. Human herpesvirus type 6",
      "B. Parvovirus B19",
      "C. Rubella",
      "D. Rubeola",
      "E. Varicella zoster virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, or Fifth disease. Adults typically do not get the facial rash (\"slapped cheek\") typical of children, but have arthralgias and arthritis. The symmetrical distribution of involved joints is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis. The onset in adults is typically 3 to 4 weeks after exposure. Parvovirus infections may persist in immunosuppressed patients, resulting in red blood cell aplasia. B19 virus can cross the placenta and cause hydrops fetalis because it infects erythroid precursors, and has been linked to the aplastic crises of sickle cell anemia.\nHuman herpesvirus type 6 (choice A) is the causative agent of roseola infantum, which is a common childhood illness that causes an extremely high fever; the fever subsides and then the child develops a lacy body rash.\nRubella (choice C) is the German measles, which is sometimes called the three-day measles. Although the rash looks similar to that of rubeola (measles), the rubella rash is less intense than that of rubeola. Rubella is best known for its ability to cross the placenta and cause serious congenital defects.\nRubeola (choice D) is the measles, which is characterized by the 3 C's (cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis) and photophobia, Koplik spots, and a maculopapular rash that begins below the ears and eventually spreads downward and also covers the face.\nVaricella zoster virus (choice E) is the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles."

He appears to be lethargic, is unable fo answer simple questions, and has an obvious left-sided hemiparesis. A CT scan of the head shows ring-enhancing lesions. He has a history of fungal esophagitis and cervical lymphadenopathy. In the United States, which of the following is the most common means of transmission of the causal agent responsible for the CT findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Contaminated meat supply",
      "B. Fecal-oral contamination",
      "C. Respiratory droplets",
      "D. Sexual transmission",
      "E. Transplacental transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The lesions shown are ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, and in an AIDS patient (suggested by history of fungal esophagitis and lymphadenopathy), this is extremely suggestive of infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasmosis presents with seizures in 15-25% of cases. Because 70-80% of the world's population is seropositive, reactivational disease in the immunocompromised is extremely common. The disease is most commonly spread in the United States by ingestion of cysts from undercooked pork (part of the contaminated meat supply), but it can also be spread transplacentally or from cat feces. Tachyzoites develop intracellularly in phagocytic cells and then spread to the brain, muscle, and other tissues, where they encyst and multiply. Primary central nervous system lymphoma in AIDS patients can present clinically in nearly the same manner as toxoplasmosis, but the course is usually much more indolent.\nFecal-oral contamination (choice B) is not the most common means of acquiring toxoplasmosis in the United States. Although cats serve as the necessary definitive host, and contamination with cat feces can cause infection, it is not the most common source in this country.\nRespiratory droplets (choice C) are not known to be a means of infection with T. gondii.\nSexual transmission (choice D) is not known to occur in toxoplasmosis.\nTransplacental transmission (choice E) occurs with Toxoplasma in 2 to 6 out of every 1,000 live births. Although it is a serious cause of birth defects, this is not the most common route of infection in the United States."

Initial isolates are susceptible to penicillin by Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion, but isolates tested later in the same month exhibit only intermediate sensitivity to the drug Which of the following is the most likely mechanism by which this drug resistance has appeared?",
    "options": [
      "A. F+ to F- conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Hfr to F- conjugation",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive coccus, is a natural transformer that does not require special culture conditions to bind free DNA from its environment and import it. Although it is difficult to prove conclusively, it is likely that transformation is the mechanism by which penicillin-binding protein mutations are transferred between strains of these bacteria. Following the transformation of one organism, natural selection operates to increase the number of resistant organisms in the population for as long as the drug is present in the environment.\nF+ to F- conjugation (choice A) is a means by which plasmids may be transferred from one bacterium to another. Because many antibiotic-resistance genes are encoded on plasmids, this is the most common means of transfer of drug resistance overall, but is especially common in gram-negative species, not Strep. pneumoniae.\nGeneralized transduction (choice B) involves the transfer of drug-resistance genes as an accident in the life cycle of a lytic phage. It is believed that phages are responsible for the transfer of methicillin resistance between Staphylococcus aureus organisms and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nHfr to F- conjugation (choice C) is a mechanism by which chromosomal genes can be transferred from one bacterium to another during conjugation. Conjugation is not believed to be involved in the transfer of drug resistance in Strep. pneumoniae.\nSpecialized transduction (choice D) involves the transfer of drug-resistance genes as an accident of the life cycle of a temperate phage. Phages are believed to be involved in the transfer of drug resistances of Staph aureus (methicillin resistance) and P aeruginosa (imipenem resistance)."

    "explanation": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well recognized cause of community-acquired lobar pneumonia associated with cavitation. It is found typically in alcoholics over 40 years of age with underlying diabetes or obstructive lung disease. K pneumoniae mimics Streptococcus pneumoniae as a pulmonary pathogen, except that Klebsiella has a greater tendency to progress to lung abscess and empyema.\nAspergilloma (choice A) is also called a fungus ball and is usually observed in a cavitary lesion remaining after a case of tuberculosis, for example.\nGhon complex (choice B) is the granulomatous lesions formed during an infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nInterstitial pattern (choice C) is the pattern commonly seen in atypical pneumonia.\nMediastinal widening (choice D) is observed in chest x-rays of individuals with pulmonary or inhalation anthrax."

During which of the stages of the bacterial growth curve shown will spore production be at its maximum?",
    "options": ["A. A", "B. B", "C. C", "D. D", "E. E", "F. F", "G. G"],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient is displaying the symptoms of inhalation anthrax (also known as wool-sorter's disease, when it is naturally acquired). The infectious form in this disease is the spore of Bacillus anthracis, which is produced in culture situations when environmental conditions become insufficient for continued growth and multiplication. Maximum spore formation usually occurs during the stationary phase, when cell growth ceases because of a developing lack of nutrients or accumulation of toxins. [Referring to a standard bacterial growth curve: A=Lag, B/C=Log/Exponential, D=Late Log/Early Stationary, E=Stationary, F/G=Decline/Death].\nThe lag phase (choice A) is the initial period of adaptation, prior to growth, which occurs when organisms are introduced to a new environment. It is not a period in which spore formation would occur.\nChoice B indicates the initial phase of bacterial multiplication, when cell division has not yet reached a maximum. This is not a period in which spore formation would occur.\nThe exponential phase (choice C) is the period of the bacterial growth curve when each bacterium in the culture is undergoing binary fission at the maximum possible rate. This is not a period in which spore formation would occur.\nChoice D indicates the phase of the bacterial growth curve when toxic metabolic products begin to accumulate and nutrient levels begin to be insufficient to support continued growth. Although spore formation could begin as early as this stage, it would not reach maximum levels until the maximum stationary phase (E).\nDuring the phases of decline (choice F) and death (choice G), the lack of nutrients and the accumulation of toxins become so severe that any viable organisms usually die before they can form spores."

      "C. Papillomavirus",
      "D. Poliovirus",
      "E. Varicella"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The rare disease illustrated here is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which typically presents as described in the question stem. SSPE appears to be due to a combination of persistent, possibly abnormal measles virus and to autoimmune damage caused by antibodies directed against the virus. Many patients developing SSPE have had measles at 2 years of age or younger; there is typically a 6-year interval between measles infection and symptom development. A small proportion of cases have followed vaccination with live measles virus. Unfortunately, no effective therapy has been developed, although experimental work with drugs such as isoprinosine shows some promise.\nPost-infectious encephalomyelitis, rather than SSPE, can follow several weeks after mumps (choice B) or varicella (choice E). Latent infection with the varicella virus causes shingles (herpes zoster).\nPapillomaviruses (choice C) are associated with warts. They do not usually infect the brain.\nPoliovirus (choice D) causes gastrointestinal disturbances, viremia, and paralysis."

      "D. Gentamicin",
      "E. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) is classified as a fungus, based on nucleic acid and biochemical analysis. To prevent confusion in the medical community, when using the “pneumonia” abbreviation, P. jirovecii pneumonia is still abbreviated as PCP. PCP is still the most common AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. The greatest risk factor for developing PCP is a CD4 count <200 cells/μL. The risk increases as the CD4 cell count falls below this level. PCP prophylactic measures are often recommended for patients with a CD4 count <200 cells/μL.\nPneumocystis infection is most commonly confined to the lungs, resulting in the development of pneumonia. The organism is believed to be acquired in early life, but it remains dormant in healthy individuals. Disease occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, including patients with AIDS and leukemia and organ transplant recipients. Typical symptoms are fever, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath. The organism attaches to and kills type I pneumocytes and damages the alveolar epithelium. Serum leaks into the alveoli, producing an exudate with a honeycomb appearance on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. With silver staining, one can see that the holes (from the honeycomb appearance) are cysts and trophozoites, which do not stain with H&E. The chest x-ray shows a characteristic patchy or ground-glass appearance, sparing the lower lobes. An elevated LDH is characteristic of PCP but is a nonspecific sign. Treatment of PCP is based on the age of the patient (child or adult), severity of the disease, and presence of any concomitant disorders or potential drug-drug interaction. Treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP in an adult or adolescent includes the following: First-line: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; Second-line: Trimethoprim plus dapsone; clindamycin plus primaquine or pentamidine; Third-line: Atovaquone. The other antibiotics in the answer choices are for bacterial infections and are not indicated for suspected Pneumocystis infection."

Which of the following additional properties is most likely to define the genus and species of the causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bacitracin resistance",
      "B. Catalase production",
      "C. Coagulase production",
      "D. Novobiocin susceptibility",
      "E. Optochin resistance"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The finding of gram-positive cocci in clusters describes the genus Staphylococcus. The fact that the staphylococci cultured are nonhemolytic (gamma-hemolytic) rules out Staphylococcus aureus (usually beta-hemolytic) and leaves Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most likely causal agent. This is a common cause of subacute bacterial endocarditis, particularly following infection of intravenous catheters or shunts. Staphylococcus epidermidis is distinguished from other clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (like S. saprophyticus) by its susceptibility to novobiocin.\nBacitracin resistance (choice A) distinguishes Streptococcus agalactiae from Streptococcus pyogenes (which is bacitracin-sensitive).\nCatalase production (choice B) is exhibited by all of the staphylococci and is the test that distinguishes them from the genus Streptococcus. Although Staphylococcus epidermidis is catalase-positive, the entire genus Staphylococcus is catalase-positive, and thus this test would not identify the species of the causative agent.\nCoagulase production (choice C) is a characteristic of only two medically important organisms, Staph aureus and Yersinia pestis. Because the present isolated organism is described as being non-hemolytic, it cannot be Staph. aureus.\nOptochin resistance (choice E) differentiates the major pathogenic alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Strep. pneumoniae is optochin- and bile-sensitive, whereas Strep. viridans is resistant to both optochin and bile."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is suffering from AV nodal heart block as a consequence of Lyme disease. This infection, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by the deer tick genus Ixodes. It is important to note that the classic expanding bull's-eye lesion (erythema migrans) is not always seen in patients. Patients may not even remember the tick bite. Erythema migrans can be the first sign of the illness and is a red patch that slowly expands as the center blanches beginning at the point of the tick bite. Generally, patients also have constitutional symptoms, such as fever and chills, during this phase. Stiff neck may develop, along with other signs of meningeal irritation, because of an aseptic meningitis. Other neurologic complications of Lyme disease include Bell palsy due to involvement of branches of the facial nerve. Arthritis is a prominent feature in about half the patients with Lyme disease and results from an immune-complex hypersensitivity. It tends to appear several months after the infection, but may persist for several years. The course of the chronic arthritis shows exacerbations and remissions; the most commonly affected joints are the knees and hips.\nYellow fever is transmitted by Aedes aegypti (choice A), and is associated with high fever, jaundice, epistaxis, anuria and hematemesis. It does not occur in the continental United States.\nMalaria transmitted by Anopheles gambiae (choice B) does not occur in the continental United States. The disease is characterized by a periodic 2-3 day fever paroxysm followed by drenching sweats, exhaustion, and hemolytic anemia.\nThe human body louse, Pediculus humanus (choice D), is responsible for transmission of relapsing fever caused by Borrelia recurrentis. This disease is associated with poverty and crowding and is endemic in Sudan and Ethiopia but would not be expected in the United States. The disease is characterized by a raised red rash, fever, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly.\nThe rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (choice E), transmits bubonic plague.

    "explanation": "Bartonella henselae is a gram-negative bacillus that is the causative agent of cat-scratch disease. Cats, especially kittens, harbor the organism. It is usually inoculated through an easily forgotten scratch. A pustule forms at the site within days to weeks, accompanied by tender regional adenopathy. Microscopically, stellate granulomas with central necrosis and organisms are observed. Normally, treatment is not required because this disease is benign and self-limited, but immunosuppressed and pregnant patients are more susceptible to dissemination. Treatment is with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline. Pregnant patients should be treated with macrolides (azithromycin).\nCamping (choice A) can be a point of exposure for a multitude of infectious agents. The mention of Arizona in the question stem could suggest coccidioidomycosis, but this would not produce a stellate granuloma, and that organism is a fungus, not a gram-negative bacillus. Spores of the organism are inhaled, usually from the soil. These spores enlarge to sporangia, which burst and spread. The disease is characterized by pulmonary symptoms in the immunocompromised, and skin bumps (erythema nodosum) in the normal patient. Infection with Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, is also possible after camping in Arizona, but it would present rather differently. True bubonic plague (incubation period 2-6 days) presents with sudden onset high fever, chills, and headaches, and tender, swollen lymph nodes (buboes). Cutaneous plague causes papules, but also pustules, a cutaneous eschar, and/or purpura, which may become necrotic.\nExploring caves (choice B) is a common point of exposure to Histoplasma capsulatum. Although this fungus can cause skin lesions in the immunocompromised and could induce granuloma formation (it is a facultative intracellular parasite), it is not a gram-negative bacillus; also, the patient is not described as having immunologic problems. The infection is acquired by breathing dust that contains bird/bat droppings with the spores of the organism. The primary infection is in the lungs and may be latent or brief and self-limited. Symptoms include fever, cough, and sweats. In the United States, it is common in the Ohio-Mississippi river valleys.\nGardening (choice C) is a common source of Sporothrix schenckii, the agent of rose-gardener's disease. This can manifest as a single cutaneous lesion or may follow lymphocutaneous drainage patterns. It is a fungus and not a gram-negative bacillus, and the lesion would be a mycetoma and not a stellate granuloma.\nTraveling outside the United States (choice E) could cause exposure to cutaneous leishmaniasis, which could manifest as a cutaneous granuloma, but it is an intracellular hemoflagellate and not a gram-negative bacillus."

Her mother says that the girl has had a fever, cough, runny nose, and pink eyes over the past 3 days, and that during the past 24 hours, she developed red lesions on the back of the neck that have spread to the trunk. Physical examination shows an erythematous, macular rash on the face, neck, thorax, and upper arms and an irregular, hypopigmented area on the buccal mucosa. The most likely causal virus belongs to which of the following viral families?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arenaviridae",
      "B. Bunyaviridae",
      "C. Orthomyxoviridae",
      "D. Paramyxoviridae",
      "E. Togaviridae"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This child has measles. It starts with the classic prodrome of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (the 3 C's), usually with a high fever. As this dissipates over a few days and prior to the onset of the exanthem, the enanthem develops, i.e., hypopigmented, irregular oral lesions on the anterior buccal mucosa. These are known as Koplik spots and are short-lived. Next is an erythematous macular rash that begins at the posterior hairline and behind the ears, spreads anteriorly to the face, and then spreads downward to the trunk and extremities. The rash lasts up to 10 days. The measles virus is a paramyxovirus, which is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Other viruses in this group are mumps, parainfluenza (infectious croup), and respiratory syncytial virus, the major cause of bronchiolitis.\nArenaviridae (choice A) are single-stranded, segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses. The major illnesses in this group are Lassa fever and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.\nBunyaviridae (choice B) are a segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus family. Examples: Hantavirus and California encephalitis virus.\nOrthomyxoviridae (choice C) are segmented, negative-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. The influenza viruses are the major example.\nTogaviridae (choice E) are positive-stranded RNA viruses. Examples are: rubella, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis, Western equine encephalomyelitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis."

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 1,200 neutrophils/mm^3, protein of 80 mg/dL, and glucose of 30 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Capsule",
      "B. Cytolysin",
      "C. Endotoxin",
      "D. Exotoxin",
      "E. Intracellular habitat"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The clinical manifestations (fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity) along with the CSF findings (increased neutrophils, elevated protein, and reduced glucose) strongly indicate acute pyogenic (bacterial) meningitis as the underlying condition. Of the microorganisms listed, either Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause this form of meningitis, however, S pneumoniae is by far the most frequent organism causing acute meningitis in patients ages 65 years and above. Its most important pathogenic mechanism is its profuse polysaccharide capsule, which protects it from phagocytosis. It is also an IgA protease producer, which assists it in colonizing the respiratory mucosa.\nCytolysins (choice B) are possessed by Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus, but not by Strep. pneumoniae.\nEndotoxin (choice C), or lipopolysaccharide, is a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Strep. pneumoniae is a gram-positive organism.\nExotoxins (choice D) are secreted toxins that are produced by many bacteria. Strep pneumoniae produces pneumolysin, which produces the characteristic alpha-hemolysis and damages the respiratory epithelium, but it is not considered the major pathogenic mechanism in the production of Strep. pneumoniae meningitis.\nIntracellular habitat (choice E) is not true in this case, since the streptococci are all extracellular pathogens."

    "question": "A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a headache and nausea. She underwent a heart transplant 14 months ago. A CT scan of the head shows ring-enhancing lesions. Examination of fissue obiained on biopsy of the brain shows multiple cystlike structures. Cultures of the lesions are negative. Which of the following is the best explanation for the syndrome in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Infected whole-blood transfusion",
      "B. Ingestion of cysts in poorly cooked pork",
      "C. Ingestion of oocysts from cat feces",
      "D. Reactivation of latent infection",
      "E. Transplant of an infected organ"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely infected with Toxoplasma gondii, which is the most common parasitic infection in the United States and probably also the world. In the United States, 60-70% of the population is infected, and once acquired, typically in childhood, the parasites persist for the lifetime of the host. The persistent cysts provoke no symptoms in a normal individual; immunologic suppression (from cancer chemotherapy, transplant, or AIDS) will reinitiate proliferation and cause symptoms consistent with those described here (ring-enhancing brain lesions). Because of the age of this patient, and her obvious immunosuppression (post-transplant), this is most likely to be a reactivated infection, dormant since childhood.\nAlthough an infected whole-blood transfusion (choice A) is a possibility, it is a remote one. Toxoplasma is an intracellular parasite and can live only in nucleated cells, not red blood cells, so it is unlikely to be transmitted during a normal infusion of packed red blood cells.\nIngestion of cysts in pork (choice B) is incorrect, because although it is the most common means of infection of U.S. residents, it is not likely in this age group because most primary infections begin in childhood. In addition, the symptoms in this patient are not consistent with a primary infection, which is most likely to be characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy and low-grade fever.\nAlthough ingestion of oocysts from cat feces (choice C) is a potential means of infection, it is not the most common in the United States or in this particular patient population.\nTransplant of an infected organ (choice E) is not the most likely means of infection. Again, because this would be a primary introduction of the parasite, the symptoms the patient would present with would be those of generalized lymphadenopathy and low-grade fever, not the obvious signs of chronic brain infection, as described in this case."

      "A. Beta-hemolytic",
      "B. Catalase-positive",
      "C. Coagulase-positive",
      "D. Growth in bile",
      "E. Growth on mannitol salt agar"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The most common cause of neonatal meningitis is Group B streptococci or Streptococcus agalactiae. Strep. agalactiae are beta-hemolytic on blood agar and produce a polypeptide that complements the sphingomyelinase of Staphylococcus aureus to produce an additional zone of beta-hemolysis that appears in an arrowhead formation on blood agar. This is known as the CAMP test, not to be confused with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).\nCatalase-positive (B), coagulase-positive (C), and growth on mannitol salt (E) are all characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus.\nGrowth in bile (choice D) is specific for Enterococcus species."

His mother states that she did not receive prenatal care during her pregnancy. Physical examination of the newborn shows a diminished sucking reflex, which was normal at birth. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows a mononuclear pleocytosis and elevated protein levels. A PCR test of the CSF is completed, but the results are pending. An MRI of the brain is performed, which shows abnormalities in the temporal lobes bilaterally. Which of the following is the most important factor in the development of this infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. Absence of antibodies in the mother",
      "B. Exposure of the mother to poorly cooked pork",
      "C. Passage through an infected birth canal",
      "D. Three-day rash in the mother",
      "E. Transplacental transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Viral causes of neonatal encephalitis include three members of the herpes family of viruses: herpes simplex-1, herpes simplex-2, and cytomegalovirus. All three types can have devastating effects on the neonate, with extensive CNS damage leading to mental retardation, seizures, and focal neurologic problems. Acyclovir may be of some help in modifying these infections, but both treatment and prognosis remain very problematic. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically involves the temporal lobes (as seen on MRI), while the other agents described do not have such a predilection. The most common means of infection of a neonate is by passage through the birth canal of a mother with active infection, although the infection may also be acquired transplacentally (HSV-2 or CMV) or from infected nursery workers (HSV-1).\nAbsence of antibodies in the mother (choice A) may affect the child's resistance to a variety of pathogens in the first 6 to 9 months of life, but because herpes viruses are syncytial viruses, antibodies play a minor role in protection.\nExposure of the mother to poorly cooked pork (choice B) is the means of infection with Toxoplasma gondii, and active infections of the mother can be transplacentally transmitted to the child. In these cases hydrocephalus and retinochoroiditis are the most common CNS findings in the infant.\nThree-day rash in the mother (choice D) describes the presentation of rubella virus infection in the adult. When it crosses the placenta, it causes patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, microcephaly, cataracts, and deafness.\nTransplacental transmission (choice E) is a means of infection of a fetus with the TORCH agents (Toxoplasma, other [syphilis], rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes). Most transplacental infections have devastating, disseminated effects in the fetus, and would be observed at birth or a matter of hours thereafter. It is not the most common means by which neonatal herpes encephalitis is acquired."

Physical examination shows keratoconjunctivitis. Within hours, several other campers and counselors visit the infirmary with similar symptoms. All of the patients had been swimming in the camp swimming pool. Eventually, more than 50% of the camp participants develop symptoms similar to the initial case. Which of the following is the most likely causal agent?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Chlamydia spp.",
      "C. Enterococcus spp.",
      "D. Herpesvirus",
      "E. Neisseria spp."
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Adenoviruses are non-enveloped (naked), icosahedral DNA viruses causing a variety of clinical syndromes. Adenoviruses cause a pharyngoconjunctivitis that affects children and sometimes adults who are living in the same household. Contaminated swimming pools have been implicated as sources for the virus. The virus may be latent in the lymphoepithelial tissue of the nasopharynx and other sites. Adenoviruses also cause watery, non-bloody diarrhea and upper respiratory infections.\nChlamydia spp. (choice B) produce a variety of clinical syndromes, including a sexually transmitted urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, neonatal pneumonia and inclusion conjunctivitis, lymphogranuloma venereum, adult interstitial pneumonia, trachoma and a zoonotic pneumonitis.\nEnterococcus spp. (choice C) are associated with endocarditis, and biliary tract and genitourinary infections.\nHerpesviruses (choice D) are large, enveloped DNA viruses with an icosahedral shape. Possible diagnoses for this patient include Epstein-Barr virus, producing infectious mononucleosis; or cytomegalovirus, producing a mononucleosis-like syndrome. The patients in the question did not have hepatosplenomegaly (characteristic of mononucleosis), but did have keratoconjunctivitis. The organism causing the outbreak in the question also has a higher level of infectivity and a short incubation time.\nNeisseria spp. (choice E) include N meningitidis and N gonorrhoeae. N meningitidis would be the logical choice, since it is associated with outbreaks among children. However, the clinical syndrome caused by infection with the meningococcus is one of a fulminant, progressive septicemia and/or meningitis with fever, vascular collapse, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. N gonorrhoeae causes sexually transmitted disease, which is unlikely in a summer camp."

Which of the following is most likely to occur during this patient's illness?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arthus reaction",
      "B. Cytotoxic hypersensitivity",
      "C. Mast cell degranulation",
      "D. Neutrophilia",
      "E. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis. Fifty percent of the cases have been reported in Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Infection can be transmitted by tick bites or by handling animal carcasses such as rabbits, squirrels, beaver, muskrats, and deer. The diagnosis is suggested by the history of exposure, clinical progression, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The ulceroglandular form of tularemia is the most common clinical presentation, but pneumonic presentation can occur. Francisella is a facultative intracellular pathogen, so cell-mediated immunity involving TH1 cells and macrophages is most important for protection. Granuloma formation would be the most common pathologic response, and granulomas are simply a manifestation of the type IV hypersensitivity response.\nThe Arthus reaction (choice A) is an example of a type III hypersensitivity (immune complex-mediated) disease. Since Francisella is a facultative intracellular pathogen, antibody production is not the most important immune response, and immune-complex disease would be rare.\nCytotoxic hypersensitivity (choice B), or type II hypersensitivity, is always autoimmune, involving autoantibodies that react with cell or tissue antigens, activate complement, and cause damage via opsonization or complement-mediated lysis. Although autoantibodies can be elicited during infectious processes, it would not be expected that an intracellular pathogen would elicit a strong antibody response.\nMast cell degranulation (choice C) occurs during parasitic infections and allergic responses. It requires the availability of IgE antibodies, which would not be expected to be made during an infection with an intracellular pathogen of macrophages.\nNeutrophilia (choice D) is the normal response to extracellular pathogens, but would not be expected with Francisella."

Culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on charcoal yeast extract (CYE) show growth of a predominant organism. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chlamydia pneumoniae",
      "B. Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C. Legionella pneumophila",
      "D. Listeria monocytogenes",
      "E. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "F. Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has a severe, potentially fatal atypical pneumonia with prominent systemic symptoms. Culture on charcoal yeast extract (CYE) is the specific clue that the organism is Legionella pneumophila. The disease is respiratory legionellosis, also known as Legionnaire disease because the disease was first described when it occurred in epidemic form following an American Legion convention at a Philadelphia hotel. Patients tend to be older (age 40-70 years) and may have risk factors including cigarette use, alcoholism, diabetes, chronic illness, or immunosuppressive therapy.\nChlamydia pneumoniae (choice A) is an agent of atypical pneumonia, but would require tissue culture for growth since it is an intracellular organism.\nHaemophilus influenzae (choice B) is an agent of pneumonia and meningitis in unvaccinated children between 3 months and 2 years of age. It must be grown on chocolate agar, since it requires NAD and hemin.\nListeria monocytogenes (choice D) causes listeriosis and is not a notable cause of pneumonia. In the adult, listeriosis is often a subclinical gastroenteritis, but when the organism crosses the placenta, the result is granulomatosis infantiseptica, which has high fatality rates in neonates. If the organism is acquired by the child passing through the birth canal, it is an agent of meningitis and septicemia.\nStaphylococcus aureus (choice E) can cause typical pneumonia and is easily cultured on blood agar.\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (choice F) causes typical pneumonia and is easily cultured on blood agar."

    "options": [
      "A. Cytomegalovirus",
      "B. Herpes simplex",
      "C. Rubella",
      "D. Syphilis",
      "E. Toxoplasmosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "All of the agents listed can cause devastating congenital infections with high mortality and often with major organ malformation (the TORCH agents: Toxoplasma, other [syphilis], rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex). However, it is herpes simplex-2, typically acquired during delivery, which causes the devastating neonatal encephalitis described here. The mortality rate for neonatal herpes is about 65%, and only 10% of the babies escape without neurologic sequelae. A point worth remembering is that adult herpes encephalitis (in immunocompetent individuals) is usually due to herpes simplex-1, whereas neonatal and congenital herpes are usually due to herpes simplex-2. In neonates, in addition to vesicular skin lesions, congenital infections with herpes simplex may cause hepatitis, pneumonitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, temperature instability, lethargy, hypotonia, respiratory distress and apnea.\nCytomegalovirus (choice A) causes \"blueberry-muffin\" disease in children infected in utero. It is characterized by thrombocytopenic purpura, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and intracerebral calcifications.\nRubella (choice C) is a serious cause of teratogenesis in utero. Congenital rubella syndrome consists of patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, microcephaly, cataracts, and deafness.\nSyphilis (choice D) can be transmitted transplacentally, but causes children to be born with a perforated palate, notched teeth, a maculopapular bronzing rash, bone deformations, and central nervous system damage.\nToxoplasmosis (choice E), caused by Toxoplasma gondii, leads to retinochoroiditis of late onset in children who are infected but born asymptomatic, and hydrocephalus and intracerebral calcifications in other infected infants."

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows leukocytes: 3,500 with 95% neutrophils, elevated protein, decreased glucose, and gram-positive cocci in pairs and short chains. By which of the following mechanisms does the most likely causal organism mediate its attachment to the respiratory mucosa?",
    "options": [
      "A. Production of a C carbohydrate",
      "B. Production of a hemolytic exotoxin",
      "C. Production of a hyaluronic acid capsule",
      "D. Production of an IgA protease",
      "E. Production of an M protein"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is a case of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. This organism is able to attach to the respiratory mucosa because it has teichoic acids in its envelope, and because it produces an IgA protease. The IgA protease physically cleaves the immunoglobulin molecules, leaving the Fc parts to coat the bacterium. This allows the organisms to bind to the Fc receptors on various mucosal cells.\nStreptococcus pneumoniae does not produce a C carbohydrate (choice A). This cell wall carbohydrate was analyzed by Rebecca Lancefield to divide the streptococci into groups. Group A (Streptococcus pyogenes), group B (Streptococcus agalactiae), and group D (Enterococcus) can be distinguished in this way. The pneumococcus and Streptococcus viridans cannot be grouped in this fashion because they do not possess this carbohydrate.\nAlthough the organism does produce the pneumolysin, which is an alpha-hemolytic exotoxin (choice B), this toxin mediates damage to the respiratory epithelium and inhibition of leukocytic responses, not attachment to the mucosa.\nStrep. pneumoniae does not produce a hyaluronic acid capsule (choice C). Strep. pyogenes does. Most capsules serve to inhibit phagocytosis, rather than to mediate adhesion.\nOnly the group A streptococci possess an M protein (choice E), which is used to \"type\" them and helps inhibit phagocytosis."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In some cases, infection with Listeria monocytogenes in pregnancy leads to an asymptomatic infection; in other cases, it produces a febrile diarrhea. All of the organisms listed can cause infection in infants, but Listeria monocytogenes is the one to cause potentially fatal granulomas (granulomatosis infantiseptica) following in utero infection. The organism is a gram-positive rod that is acquired by the mother eating delicatessen foods. It is treated with ampicillin.\nEscherichia coli (choice A) can cause diarrhea, pneumonia, and meningitis in infants, but would not be a cause of widespread granulomatous lesions. Remember that most granuloma-forming agents are intracellular; the only exceptions to this rule are those that cause chronic infections or are somehow indigestible to the immune response.\nHerpes simplex virus-2 (choice B) can be transmitted to a fetus in utero or during passage through the birth canal and may cause life-threatening infection. However, it would be more likely to cause hepatitis, encephalitis, or respiratory disease.\nKlebsiella granulomatis (choice C) is the agent of granuloma inguinale, a sexually transmitted disease that is rare in the United States.

Which of the following best describes the drug-resistance genes of the Hfr donor cell?",
    "options": [
      "A. The drug-resistance genes are in a bacteriophage genome",

      "D. The gene in the sequence closest to oriT encodes vancomycin resistance",
      "E. The gene in the sequence farthest from the tra operon encodes ampicillin resistance"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Hfr donor bacteria are capable of transferring chromosomal genes to F- recipient cells. The order of the transfer is from oriT (origin of transfer) toward the tra operon (part of the integrated F factor, transferred last, if at all). Thus, the likelihood of successful recombination (transfer frequency) is a function of the placement of genes on the chromosome relative to oriT. Those closest to oriT are most likely to be successfully transferred, and those farthest away (closer to the tra operon) are least likely. In this case, ampicillin resistance has the highest transfer frequency (95%), meaning it is closest to oriT. Vancomycin resistance has the lowest transfer frequency (45%), meaning it is farthest from oriT and closest to the tra operon.\nChoice E states that the gene farthest from the tra operon (meaning closest to oriT) encodes ampicillin resistance. This is consistent with the data (95% transfer frequency for ampicillin).\nChoice A is incorrect; phage transfer involves transduction. Choice B is incorrect; Hfr involves an integrated F factor, not a free conjugative plasmid (that would be F+ conjugation). Choice C is incorrect; the transferred genes are chromosomal, mobilized by the integrated episome (F factor).

The diagnosis is suggested by the fever, headache, GI symptoms, and characteristic rash (starting peripherally on ankles/wrists and spreading centrally). The tetracyclines are a class of antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of rickettsial infections. The key to this question is knowing which tetracycline antibiotic is safest to administer to a patient with renal dysfunction. Doxycycline is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion into the feces, and its serum half-life is not significantly affected by renal impairment. Other tetracyclines (demeclocycline, methacycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline) are primarily excreted by the kidneys and can accumulate to toxic levels in patients with renal failure, requiring dose adjustment or avoidance. Therefore, doxycycline is the preferred tetracycline in this patient."

    "question": "A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of fever, chills, severe headache, and vomiting. He appears confused and disoriented. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows numerous lymphocytes and some erythrocytes. A CT scan of the head will most likely show inflammation in which of the following locations?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cerebellum",
      "B. Frontal lobe",
      "C. Occipital lobe",
      "D. Parietal lobe",
      "E. Temporal lobe"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has encephalitis, suggested by fever, headache, altered mental status (confusion, disorientation). The CSF findings (lymphocytic pleocytosis, presence of RBCs which can indicate hemorrhagic inflammation) are characteristic of viral encephalitis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of sporadic, severe viral encephalitis in the United States. HSV-1 encephalitis has a characteristic predilection for involving the temporal lobes, often asymmetrically. CT or MRI scans typically show edema, inflammation, and sometimes hemorrhage localized to the temporal lobes. The other lobes (frontal, parietal, occipital) and cerebellum are less commonly affected primarily by HSV encephalitis."

    "question": "A 2-week-old newborn develops fever, lethargy, and seizures. The infant was born at term with no obstetric or early postnatal complications. Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained on lumbar puncture shows a high neutrophil count and gram-positive cocci in chains. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha-hemolysis",
      "B. Bacitracin sensitivity",
      "C. CAMP test positivity",
      "D. Growth on bile-esculin agar",
      "E. Optochin sensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This baby has bacterial meningitis presenting in the late-onset neonatal period (after first week). The CSF shows bacterial infection (high neutrophils, gram-positive cocci). Group B Streptococcus (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) is the most common cause of both early-onset (<7 days) and late-onset (7 days to 3 months) neonatal meningitis. GBS is characterized by being beta-hemolytic (though sometimes weakly), catalase-negative, bacitracin-resistant, and CAMP test positive. The CAMP test detects a synergistic hemolysis when GBS is streaked perpendicular to Staphylococcus aureus on blood agar. Alpha-hemolysis (A) and optochin sensitivity (E) characterize S. pneumoniae. Bacitracin sensitivity (B) characterizes S. pyogenes (Group A Strep). Growth on bile-esculin agar (D) characterizes Enterococcus and Group D streptococci."

    "question": "A microbiology laboratory isolates a strain of bacteria that does not possess the recA gene. Which of the following processes would this bacterial strain be capable of performing normally?",
    "options": [
      "A. F+ to F- conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Hfr to F- conjugation",
      "D. Specialized transduction",
      "E. Transformation"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The recA gene encodes the RecA protein, which is essential for homologous recombination in bacteria. Homologous recombination is required to stably integrate linear fragments of DNA transferred via Hfr conjugation, generalized transduction, specialized transduction, or transformation into the recipient chromosome. F+ to F- conjugation involves the transfer of a self-replicating plasmid (the F factor). Since the F factor can replicate independently, its stable maintenance in the recipient does not require integration into the chromosome via homologous recombination. Therefore, F+ to F- conjugation can proceed normally in a recA-deficient strain. All other listed processes (B, C, D, E) involve the transfer of linear DNA fragments that require RecA-mediated homologous recombination for stable inheritance."

    "question": "Autopsy of a 23-year-old man who died in a motor vehicle collision shows a small cluster of caseating granulomas in the right lung just above the interlobar fissure, and similar granulomas in the hilar lymph nodes. Acid-fast staining shows acid-fast bacilli within these lesions. No other lesions are found in the remaining organs and tissues. Which of the following is the most accurate interpretation of these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Disseminated infection",
      "B. Primary infection",
      "C. Reactivational disease",
      "D. Re-exposure disease",
      "E. Remote healed infection"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The finding of a Ghon complex – a peripheral lung lesion (Ghon focus, often subpleural in mid-to-lower lung zones) plus involvement of the draining hilar lymph nodes, both containing caseating granulomas with acid-fast bacilli – is the characteristic pathologic hallmark of primary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). This represents the initial infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While these lesions often heal by fibrosis and calcification (choice E), finding active caseating granulomas with bacilli indicates an active primary infection, even if discovered incidentally at autopsy. Disseminated (miliary) TB (choice A) involves widespread seeding. Reactivation (secondary) TB (choice C) typically occurs in the lung apices and often involves cavitation, without the classic hilar node involvement of primary infection. Re-exposure (choice D) might lead to secondary TB if immunity is insufficient."

He recently returned from a 5-day trip to Southeast Asia, where he was a news correspondent. Over the next several days, he develops progressive hemolytic anemia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. He lapses into a coma. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Babesia microti",

      "C. Plasmodium malariae",
      "D. Plasmodium ovale",
      "E. Plasmodium vivax"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with severe, multi-system illness (hemolytic anemia, pulmonary edema, renal failure, cerebral involvement leading to coma) after travel to Southeast Asia, a malaria-endemic region. This clinical picture is characteristic of severe, complicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. P. falciparum infection can lead to high levels of parasitemia, sequestration of infected red blood cells in the microvasculature of vital organs (brain, lungs, kidneys), and life-threatening complications like cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury. Babesia microti (choice A) causes babesiosis, mainly in the northeastern US, typically milder than this. P. malariae (choice C) causes quartan malaria, usually less severe. P. ovale (choice D) and P. vivax (choice E) cause tertian malaria; P. vivax is common but less likely than P. falciparum to cause such severe, multi-organ complications, although severe vivax malaria can occur."

      "C. Mycoplasma pneumoniae",
      "D. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "E. Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with symptoms of pneumonia (fever, productive cough, chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia) and a pleural friction rub (suggesting pleuritis/empyema). The key diagnostic clue is the thick, bloody, mucoid sputum described as \"currant jelly\" sputum, which is characteristic of pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Klebsiella pneumonia often occurs in older adults, individuals with alcoholism, diabetes, or chronic lung disease, and those in nursing homes. It typically causes lobar pneumonia, often in the upper lobes, with a propensity for necrosis, cavitation, and abscess formation.\nLegionella pneumophila (choice B) causes atypical pneumonia, often with prominent systemic symptoms and diarrhea.\nMycoplasma pneumoniae (choice C) causes atypical (\"walking\") pneumonia, usually milder with a non-productive cough.\nStaphylococcus aureus (choice D) can cause severe, necrotizing pneumonia, often post-influenza, but sputum is typically purulent or salmon-colored.\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (choice E) is the most common cause of typical pneumonia, often presenting with rust-colored sputum, but \"currant jelly\" points strongly to Klebsiella."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive vaginal pruritus for the past 3 days. She recently had a urinary tract infection and she was treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for mild erythema of the vulvar area, and a white vaginal discharge. A swab of the vaginal discharge is taken and inoculated into animal serum. Which of the following is mast likely fo be seen in this medium after 2-3 hours?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arthroconidia",
      "B. Encapsulated yeasts",
      "C. Hyphae with rosettes of microconidia",
      "D. Macroconidia",
      "E. Pseudohyphae"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient likely has vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection), often precipitated by antibiotic use (like TMP-SMX) which disrupts normal vaginal flora. The symptoms (pruritus, white discharge) are typical. Candida albicans is the most common cause. The germ tube test involves inoculating the organism into serum and incubating for 2-3 hours; C. albicans characteristically forms germ tubes, which are the initial hyphal outgrowths from yeast cells, appearing as parallel-sided tubes without constriction at the origin. These are essentially young pseudohyphae or true hyphae. Therefore, pseudohyphae (or germ tubes) would be seen.\nArthroconidia (choice A) are seen in dermatophytes.\nEncapsulated yeasts (choice B) are characteristic of Cryptococcus neoformans.\nRosettes of microconidia (choice C) are seen in Sporothrix schenckii.\nMacroconidia (choice D) are produced by fungi like Histoplasma in its mold form."

Physical examination shows a fibrinous coating on the oral and nasal mucosa. The father says that the boy is not up-to-date on immunizations. Toxins produced by the causal organism will most likely have which of the following effects?",
    "options": [
      "A. Block translation elongation",
      "B. Disrupt membrane integrity",
      "C. Interfere with neurotransmitter release",
      "D. Interfere with ribosomal subunit",
      "E. Stimulate cAMP production"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The presence of a pseudomembrane in the oropharynx of an unvaccinated child with fever and sore throat is highly suggestive of diphtheria, caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The diphtheria toxin is an A-B toxin that ADP-ribosylates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2). ADP-ribosylation inactivates eEF-2, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis by blocking the translocation step of translation elongation. This leads to cell death and contributes to the pseudomembrane formation and systemic effects (e.g., myocarditis, neuropathy).\nMembrane disruption (B) is caused by toxins like alpha-toxin (S. aureus, C. perfringens). Interference with neurotransmitter release (C) is the mechanism of tetanus and botulinum toxins. Interference with ribosomal subunits (D) is the mechanism of Shiga toxin and EHEC verotoxin (acting on 60S subunit). Stimulation of cAMP production (E) is caused by toxins like cholera toxin, ETEC LT, pertussis toxin, and anthrax edema factor."

After 24 hours in culture, the tofal virus per culture in each of the five systems is determined. Naked genomic material added from which of the following viruses will most likely result in the absence of progeny viruses?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Calicivirus",
      "C. Flavivirus",
      "D. Picornavirus",
      "E. Reovirus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This experiment tests whether the naked viral genome itself is infectious. For a naked genome to be infectious, it must be able to direct the synthesis of viral proteins (including any necessary polymerases) using the host cell machinery upon entry. Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA, like Calicivirus, Flavivirus, Picornavirus) can function directly as mRNA. DNA viruses (like Adenovirus) can be transcribed by host RNA polymerase. However, double-stranded RNA viruses (like Reovirus) and negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (-ssRNA) require their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to be packaged within the virion to synthesize mRNA from the viral genome. Without this pre-packaged polymerase, the naked dsRNA or -ssRNA genome cannot initiate replication. Therefore, the naked genomic material of Reovirus would not be infectious and would result in the absence of progeny."

      "C. Herpes simplex 1",
      "D. Impetigo",
      "E. Measles"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This is impetigo, which is typically seen in preschool children with poor hygiene, particularly in the summer in warm climates. The characteristic lesion is frequently large and has a golden, honey-colored crust. Younger lesions are smaller, and may have small blisters (bullous impetigo) or weeping surfaces (non-bullous impetigo). Most cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pyogenes is occasionally implicated. Impetigo is highly infectious, and mini-epidemics can occur in daycare settings. The initial treatment is typically with penicillins and topical preparations. Methicillin-resistant strains are presently rare in this setting, but can occur.\nAphthous ulcers (choice A), commonly known as \"canker sores,\" are painful, shallow ulcers of the oral cavity.\nErysipelas (choice B) is a different type of skin infection, often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (also sometimes, others including Staphylococcus), and is characterized by large erythematous patches with sharply demarcated raised borders.\nHerpes simplex 1 (choice C) causes tiny oral and perioral vesicles, but not large, golden crusts.\nMeasles (choice E) causes a blotchy erythematous rash."

    "explanation": "The triad of cutaneous hemorrhages (\"blueberry-muffin baby\" due to extramedullary hematopoiesis), deafness (sensorineural hearing loss), and periventricular CNS calcifications suggests congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, the most common congenital viral infection. Other manifestations include microcephaly and hepatosplenomegaly. Primary CMV infection in the mother during pregnancy carries the highest risk of transmission and severe fetal effects. Primary CMV infection in an immunocompetent adult is often asymptomatic or presents as a mononucleosis-like syndrome with mild fever, malaise, myalgias, and generalized lymphadenopathy.\nA 3-day rash (choice A) is characteristic of Rubella in adults. Painless genital ulcers (choice C) suggest primary Syphilis. Transient arthralgia (choice D) can be seen with Parvovirus B19 infection in adults. Vesicular genital lesions (choice E) suggest Herpes Simplex Virus."

      "E. Tick bite"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Spontaneous abortion associated with a preceding maternal flu-like illness and evidence of amnionitis is characteristic of listeriosis during pregnancy, caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a foodborne pathogen often transmitted through contaminated ready-to-eat foods like soft cheeses, delicatessen meats, and unpasteurized milk. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to listeriosis, which can lead to bacteremia, chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal sepsis/meningitis (granulomatosis infantiseptica). Handling cats (B) risks Toxoplasma. Rat bites (C) can transmit Streptobacillus moniliformis. Sexual transmission (D) is relevant for CMV, HSV, etc. Tick bites (E) transmit Lyme, RMSF, etc. None of these typically cause this specific scenario as commonly as Listeria."

      "C. Pigment formation",
      "D. Polysaccharide capsule",
      "E. Toxin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The history of recurrent respiratory infections and chronic diarrhea, along with current symptoms, suggests cystic fibrosis (CF). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common and important pathogen causing chronic lung infections in CF patients. It is a non-lactose-fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod. A key virulence factor, particularly in chronic CF infections, is the production of a mucoid exopolysaccharide capsule (alginate). This capsule forms a biofilm, protecting the bacteria from host defenses (phagocytosis, antibodies, complement) and antibiotics, contributing significantly to the persistence of infection and lung damage. While Pseudomonas also produces catalase (A), pigments (C, pyocyanin, pyoverdin), and toxins (E, exotoxin A), the polysaccharide capsule/biofilm formation is considered paramount in the context of chronic CF lung disease."

      "A. It is an intracellular pathogen",
      "B. It is resistant to ceftriaxone",
      "C. It is resistant to complement-mediated lysis",
      "D. Its capsule is not immunogenic",
      "E. Its pili undergo antigenic and phase variation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), characterized by the triad of dermatitis (petechial or pustular rash), tenosynovitis, and migratory polyarthritis/polyarthralgia. The causative agent is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Recurrent infections are common because N. gonorrhoeae exhibits extensive antigenic variation, particularly of its pili (adhesins) and outer membrane proteins (like Opa proteins). This variation allows the organism to evade the host adaptive immune response, as antibodies generated against one antigenic variant are not effective against subsequent variants. Phase variation (turning expression of certain antigens on or off) also contributes to immune evasion. N. gonorrhoeae is an extracellular pathogen (A), generally sensitive to ceftriaxone (B), susceptible to complement (C - especially late components; deficiency increases risk), and its capsule is not a major virulence factor/non-immunogenic issue (D)."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This case illustrates a classic presentation of ruptured ectopic pregnancy presenting with abdominal pain, shock (due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage), adnexal mass, and positive hCG. A major risk factor for ectopic pregnancy is prior pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can cause scarring and damage to the fallopian tubes, impairing transport of the fertilized ovum. The most common bacterial causes of PID are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Chlamydial infections are often asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, leading to unrecognized tubal damage. Therefore, a previous Chlamydia infection is a very likely precursor. Escherichia (B) causes UTIs. Herpes (C), HPV (D), and Treponema (E, syphilis) are STIs but are not primary causes of PID leading to tubal scarring in the same way as Chlamydia or Gonorrhea."

      "D. Decreased ribosomal binding of antibiotic",
      "E. Formation of novel cell-wall peptide bridges"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The organism described (grows in 6.5% NaCl, bile esculin positive, gamma-hemolytic gram-positive cocci) is characteristic of Enterococcus species. The isolate is vancomycin-resistant (Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus, VRE). Vancomycin normally inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine (D-ala-D-ala) terminus of peptidoglycan precursors, preventing transglycosylation and transpeptidation. High-level vancomycin resistance in enterococci (e.g., VanA, VanB phenotypes) is mediated by genes that alter the target site. These genes encode enzymes that synthesize peptidoglycan precursors ending in D-alanyl-D-lactate (D-ala-D-lac) or D-alanyl-D-serine instead of D-ala-D-ala. Vancomycin binds poorly to these altered termini, allowing cell wall synthesis to proceed. This represents the formation of novel cell-wall peptide bridges/precursors. Acetylation (A) inactivates aminoglycosides/chloramphenicol. Altered PBPs (B) cause beta-lactam resistance. Beta-lactamase (C) hydrolyzes beta-lactams. Decreased ribosomal binding (D) confers resistance to protein synthesis inhibitors."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, as evidenced by the characteristic erythema migrans rash and flu-like symptoms after visiting an endemic area (Massachusetts). Lyme disease is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick (deer tick). This same tick vector is also responsible for transmitting other pathogens in the same geographic areas, notably Babesia microti (causing babesiosis) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causing human granulocytic anaplasmosis). Therefore, coinfection with Babesia microti is a known possibility when a patient acquires Lyme disease from an Ixodes tick bite. Chlamydophila psittaci (B) is from birds. Plasmodium vivax (C) is transmitted by mosquitoes. Rickettsia rickettsii (D, RMSF) is transmitted by Dermacentor ticks. Yersinia pestis (E, plague) is transmitted by fleas."

The Gram stain shows gram-positive cocci, and culture reveals alpha-hemolytic (greenish discoloration) colonies that are sensitive (inhibited by) optochin. This combination of features is classic for Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Alpha-hemolysis distinguishes it from beta-hemolytic streptococci (like S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae). Optochin sensitivity distinguishes S. pneumoniae from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci like viridans streptococci (S. mutans, S. sanguis), which are optochin-resistant.\nStreptococcus agalactiae (A) is beta-hemolytic, bacitracin-resistant, CAMP positive.\nStreptococcus mutans (B) and Streptococcus sanguis (E) are viridans group streptococci, alpha-hemolytic and optochin-resistant.\nStreptococcus pyogenes (D) is beta-hemolytic and bacitracin-sensitive."

    "explanation": "The patient's symptoms and positive HBsAg, anti-HBc IgM, and HBeAg indicate acute hepatitis B infection. The 'window period' in hepatitis B serology refers to the time after HBsAg disappears from the serum but before HBsAb (antibody to HBsAg) becomes detectable. During this period, anti-HBc IgM remains positive and is the key marker indicating recent/acute infection. Therefore, the transition into the window period is marked by the loss of detectable HBsAg (it becomes negative). HBcAg (A) is not typically measured in serum. Anti-HBc IgG (B) appears later and persists long-term. HBeAg (C) may disappear before or during the window period as the infection resolves, replaced by anti-HBe, but the defining event is HBsAg loss. HBsAb (D) appears *after* the window period."

    "question": "A culture of bacteria is incubated with bacteriophages and then centrifuged to pellet the bacterial cells. The liquid above the cells is then added to new cultures of bacteria. In these new cultures, 5 clones of bacteria are seen to acquire 5 different new genetic traits. Which of the following best describes this phenomenon?",
    "options": [
      "A. Conjugation",
      "B. Generalized transduction",
      "C. Specialized transduction",
      "D. Transformation",
      "E. Transposition"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The experiment involves using bacteriophages (incubated with initial bacteria) to transfer genetic traits to new bacteria via the cell-free supernatant (containing released phages). This process is transduction. Generalized transduction occurs during the lytic cycle when random fragments of bacterial DNA are accidentally packaged into phage heads instead of phage DNA. These transducing phages can then infect new bacteria and transfer the incorporated bacterial genes. Because any bacterial gene can be transferred randomly, multiple different traits can be acquired by different recipient cells, as observed (5 different traits in 5 clones). Specialized transduction (C) involves the transfer of specific bacterial genes located adjacent to the phage integration site during the excision of a lysogenic (temperate) phage genome, typically transferring only a limited set of genes. Conjugation (A) requires cell contact. Transformation (D) involves uptake of naked DNA. Transposition (E) is movement of DNA within a cell."

    "question": "A 47-year-old HIV-positive woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Antiretroviral therapy was started 6 years ago. Laboratory studies show a steadily decreasing CD4 count. A test to determine the patient's viral load would identify which of the following in her blood?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antibodies to envelope antigens",
      "B. Antibody to viral capsid",
      "C. Proviral DNA",
      "D. Surface antigens of the virus",
      "E. Viral RNA"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Viral load testing in HIV management measures the amount of actively replicating virus in the patient's plasma. Since HIV is an RNA retrovirus, the standard method for quantifying viral load is to measure the amount of HIV RNA in the plasma using techniques like reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or branched DNA (bDNA) assays. A high or increasing viral load, despite therapy, indicates treatment failure or drug resistance, correlating with the decreasing CD4 count. Antibodies (A, B) indicate infection status but not the amount of active replication. Proviral DNA (C) represents the integrated viral genome in host cells and reflects the size of the viral reservoir, not necessarily the level of active replication. Viral surface antigens (D, like p24) can be measured but RNA quantification is the standard for viral load."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of chest pain and a cough that is occasionally productive of bloody sputum. An x-ray of the chest shows a cavitary lesion in the lung. Auramine-rhodamine stain of the sputum is positive Which of the following properties of the most likely causal organism provides it with resistance to Gram-stain reagents?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lipopolysaccharide",
      "B. Mycolic acid",
      "C. Polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid",
      "D. Sulfatide",
      "E. Tuberculin"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient likely has pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), suggested by cough, hemoptysis, and a cavitary lung lesion on X-ray. The positive auramine-rhodamine stain (a fluorescent stain for acid-fast bacilli) confirms the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacteria are termed 'acid-fast' because their unique cell wall structure resists decolorization by acid-alcohol after being stained. This property, and their resistance to Gram staining, is primarily due to the very high lipid content of their cell wall, particularly the abundant long-chain fatty acids called mycolic acids. These form a waxy, hydrophobic barrier. Lipopolysaccharide (A) is found in gram-negative outer membranes. Peptidoglycan (C) is the polymer stained in Gram staining, but it's covered by the mycolic acid layer in mycobacteria. Sulfatides (D) are other lipids in the cell wall contributing to virulence. Tuberculin (E) refers to proteins used in the PPD skin test."

    "question": "An 11-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of recurrent tonsillitis. She undergoes tonsillectomy. Examination of the tonsils shows numerous small yellow granules. Gram stain of one of the granules shows a dense, gram-positive center and numerous branching filaments at the periphery. The granules are most likely composed of which of the following organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Actinomyces israelii",
      "B. Aspergillus fumigatus",
      "C. Blastomyces dermatitidis",
      "D. Candida albicans",
      "E. Corynebacteria diphtheriae"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Actinomyces are normal inhabitants of the oral cavity that grow under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. Although they are gram-positive rods, they grow as branching filaments and have been confused with fungi. They characteristically form macroscopic colonies known as 'sulfur granules' (which are yellowish and granular, but do not contain sulfur) within infected tissues, such as chronically infected tonsils or in abscesses (e.g., cervicofacial actinomycosis or 'lumpy jaw'). Gram stain of these granules reveals a central mass of tangled gram-positive filaments with radiating clubs at the periphery. Aspergillus (B) is a mold forming hyphae. Blastomyces (C) is a dimorphic fungus, yeast in tissue. Candida (D) is a yeast, forming pseudohyphae or yeast cells. Corynebacterium (E) are gram-positive rods, not typically forming granules or branching filaments in this manner."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Hepatitis B infection can produce a wide variety of clinical outcomes. The most common outcome (60 to 65%), however, turns out to be subclinical disease followed by complete recovery. Approximately 20 to 25% of infected persons develop acute hepatitis (choice A), which is followed in 90% of these cases by recovery and in about 10% of cases by progression to chronic hepatitis (choice D). Of those who develop chronic hepatitis, some may become asymptomatic carriers (choice B). Persistent infection followed by recovery (choice C) is less precise terminology; recovery usually follows either acute or subclinical infection. Given the statistics, subclinical infection with recovery is the single most likely outcome for an unvaccinated adult exposed to HBV."

      "G. St. Louis encephalitis virus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This case describes a pandemic of influenza A, which is caused by the ability of the virus to undergo dramatic genetic changes of type by reassortment of its segmented RNA genome: a trait called antigenic shift. Genetic reassortment can only occur in viruses with segmented genomes, where different segments can be swapped between co-infecting viruses. Besides influenza virus (Orthomyxoviridae), other medically important viruses with segmented RNA genomes include Rotavirus (Reoviridae, 11 segments), Bunyaviridae (3 segments), and Arenaviridae (2 segments). Among the choices, only Rotavirus possesses a segmented genome. Coronavirus (A), HIV (B, retrovirus), Measles virus (C, paramyxovirus), Rabies virus (D, rhabdovirus), Rubella virus (F, togavirus), and St. Louis encephalitis virus (G, flavivirus) all have non-segmented genomes."

Physical examination shows hyperemia of the pharynx, tonsillar exudates, cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Treatment with ampicillin is begun. The patient returns to the physician 8 days later because of a generalized maculopapular rash. The most likely causal agent of this woman's initial condition is linked to development of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gastric adenocarcinoma",
      "B. Hepatocellular carcinoma",
      "C. Laryngeal papillomas",
      "D. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
      "E. T-cell leukemia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Clinical features include sore throat, headache, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, hepatosplenomegaly, periorbital edema, rash, and a palatal enanthem. The diagnosis is made by heterophile antibody testing (monospot), EBV antibody titers, and the finding of lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. Treatment includes rest, fluids, and analgesics. Administration of penicillin derivatives (ampicillin) can lead to a characteristic maculopapular rash in patients with EBV mononucleosis.\nLinks between chronic EBV infection and tumors have been most strongly established with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the African form of Burkitt lymphoma, and B-cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed individuals.\nGastric adenocarcinomas (choice A) are linked to Helicobacter pylori infection. Some epidemiologic studies have suggested a possible link between gastric adenocarcinoma and EBV, but this is controversial because EBV exposure is so common in the general population.\nHepatocellular carcinoma (choice B) has been linked to chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections.\nLaryngeal papillomas (choice C) have been linked to chronic infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11.\nT-cell leukemia (choice E) is most strongly linked to human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Rare forms of T-cell lymphoma have occasionally been linked to EBV infection, but this association is much weaker than the association between EBV and nasopharyngeal carcinoma."

      "A. Klebsiella pneumoniae",
      "B. Mycoplasma pneumoniae",
      "C. Parainfluenza virus",
      "D. Respiratory syncytial virus",
      "E. Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has primary atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This is the most common atypical pneumonia in young adults and occurs in crowded living situations (e.g., dorms, military barracks). This organism is fastidious and difficult to culture ('slow-growing') in the laboratory; however, serodiagnosis can be most helpful. It is an extracellular prokaryote with no cell wall, but with sterols in the membrane. Patients typically produce one or two heterophile antibodies during the course of the infection; one agglutinates human O+ red blood cells in the cold (the cold hemagglutinin), while the other causes the agglutination of a strain of Streptococcus salivarius termed strain MG (the Strep MG agglutinins). The presence of cold agglutinins is a classic, though not entirely specific, finding associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. The treatment is with macrolides (i.e., erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin).\nKlebsiella pneumoniae (choice A) causes typical pneumonia, often with currant jelly sputum.\nParainfluenza viruses (choice C) cause croup.\nRespiratory syncytial virus (choice D) causes bronchiolitis in infants.\nStrep. pneumoniae (choice E) causes typical pneumonia, usually with rust-colored sputum."

    "options": [
      "A. Entamoeba histolytica",
      "B. Escherichia coli",
      "C. Giardia lamblia",
      "D. Naegleria fowleri",
      "E. Trichomonas vaginalis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The probable organism is Giardia lamblia, which characteristically infects the small intestine (duodenum and jejunum). When seen in smears from duodenal aspirates, this flagellated organism has a characteristic \"facelike\" appearance (pear-shaped trophozoite with two nuclei). However, in biopsy specimens the organism is often caught at an angle, appearing somewhat crescent-shaped when attached to the brush border of the enterocytes. Giardia is a common contaminant of water supplies (even in the United States), and patients who ingest the cysts may be asymptomatic or may occasionally develop prolonged diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, or intestinal malabsorption. Some patients with severe disease have low serum IgA or low overall immunoglobulin levels.\nEntamoeba histolytica (choice A) usually infects the large intestine and/or liver.\nEscherichia coli (choice B) is a bacterial cause of diarrhea.\nNaegleria fowleri (choice D) causes meningoencephalitis.\nTrichomonas vaginalis (choice E) causes vaginitis."

Which of the following bacteria is most likely responsible for this patient's infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. Enterobacter sp.",
      "B. Enterococcus faecalis",
      "C. Escherichia coli",
      "D. Klebsiella pneumoniae",
      "E. Proteus mirabilis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The positive leukocyte esterase test indicates the presence of neutrophils (pyuria), suggesting a urinary tract infection (UTI). The nitrite test detects the presence of nitrite, which is produced when bacteria reduce urinary nitrate. Most common UTI pathogens, particularly gram-negative rods belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family (like E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter), are nitrite-positive. However, some common UTI pathogens, including Enterococcus species (gram-positive cocci) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (gram-positive cocci), do not reduce nitrate to nitrite and are therefore nitrite-negative. Given the positive leukocyte esterase (indicating infection) but negative nitrite test, Enterococcus faecalis is a likely causative organism among the choices. Enterococcal urinary tract infections are often nosocomial but can also occur in the community.\nEnterobacter sp. (A), Escherichia coli (C), Klebsiella pneumoniae (D), and Proteus mirabilis (E) are all Enterobacteriaceae and would typically be nitrite-positive."

Qualitative analysis of stool shows curved rods in the fecal smear, along with red blood cells and leukocytes. Which of the following laboratory tests is most appropriate to differentiate the pathogen responsible for these findings from other organisms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Growth at 4°C (39.2°F)",

      "D. Growth on MacConkey",
      "E. Growth on sorbitol MacConkey"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation (inflammatory, bloody diarrhea after eating undercooked chicken) and the microscopic finding of curved (comma-shaped or S-shaped) gram-negative rods in the stool strongly suggest Campylobacter jejuni infection. Campylobacter is a microaerophilic organism. A key characteristic used for its selective isolation in the laboratory is its ability to grow well at elevated temperatures, specifically 42°C. Incubating stool cultures on selective media (like Campy BAP) at 42°C inhibits the growth of most normal enteric flora while allowing Campylobacter to grow.\nGrowth at 4°C (A) selects for Yersinia or Listeria.\nGrowth on MacConkey (D) and EMB (C) is used for differentiating Enterobacteriaceae based on lactose fermentation. Campylobacter does not typically grow well on these standard enteric media.\nGrowth on sorbitol MacConkey (E) is used to differentiate E. coli O157:H7 (sorbitol-negative) from other E. coli strains."

      "F. Pear-shaped, flagellated protozoa",
      "G. Pleomorphic, gram-negative rods",
      "H. Spirochetes on darkfield microscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation (fever, lower abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, cervical erythema) is typical for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D-K) is the most common bacterial cause of PID in many settings. Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium. Microscopic examination of cervical discharge in chlamydial cervicitis often shows epithelial cells and may show scant neutrophils (unlike gonorrhea which typically has abundant neutrophils). Definitive diagnosis often involves nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), but historically, visualization of intracellular inclusions within epithelial cells using special stains like Giemsa or iodine (which stains glycogen-rich inclusions characteristic of C. trachomatis) was used. Therefore, iodine-staining intraepithelial inclusion bodies are the most likely specific finding related to Chlamydia among the choices.\nA naked DNA virus (A) refers to HPV. Intraneutrophilic gram-negative diplococci (B) refers to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (another common cause of PID, but less likely given scant neutrophils). Intranuclear inclusions with halos (C) suggest CMV or Herpes. Lactose-fermenting bacilli (E) like E. coli cause UTIs. Flagellated protozoa (F) refer to Trichomonas. Pleomorphic gram-negative rods (G) could be Gardnerella or Haemophilus ducreyi. Spirochetes (H) refer to Treponema pallidum (syphilis)."

      "D. Vibrio cholerae",
      "E. Vibrio vulnificus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Vibrio vulnificus is an extremely invasive organism, often acquired through consumption of raw shellfish (like oysters) or exposure of wounds to contaminated seawater. It can cause rapidly progressing illness, particularly in individuals with underlying liver disease or immunocompromise. Symptoms after ingestion include gastroenteritis (watery diarrhea), followed by primary septicemia with fever, chills, hypotension, and characteristic hemorrhagic bullae (fluid-filled vesicular/bullous lesions) on the skin, especially the extremities. The mortality rate for V. vulnificus septicemia is very high (>50%), often leading to rapid deterioration and death, as described in this case.\nCampylobacter jejuni (A) causes inflammatory diarrhea, usually from poultry.\nETEC (B) causes traveler's diarrhea.\nSalmonella (C) causes gastroenteritis, less commonly invasive.\nVibrio cholerae (D) causes profuse watery ('rice-water') diarrhea due to cholera toxin, but typically without the skin lesions and rapid septicemia seen here."

    "options": [
      "A. Ciprofloxacin",

      "C. Gentamicin",
      "D. Sulfonamide",
      "E. Vancomycin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Specialized transduction occurs when a temperate bacteriophage that has integrated into the bacterial chromosome (prophage) excises improperly, taking adjacent bacterial genes along with it. This phage, carrying specific bacterial genes, can then infect a new host cell and transfer these genes. Therefore, genes located closest to the phage integration site (att site, labeled 'IS' here) are the most likely to be transferred by specialized transduction. According to the provided genetic map, the sulfonamide resistance gene is located immediately adjacent to the IS site. The gentamicin resistance gene is also near IS but slightly farther away than sulfonamide based on typical diagrammatic representation. Therefore, sulfonamide resistance is the most likely gene to be transferred via specialized transduction involving this integration site."

A heterophile antibody test is negative and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is positive for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Seven months later, the woman delivers a full-term baby with no obvious signs of infection. Measurement of which the following isotypes of immunoglobulin is most appropriate to defect acute infection in the neonate?",
    "options": ["A. IgA", "B. IgE", "C. IgG1", "D. IgG4", "E. IgM"],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The mother experienced symptoms consistent with acute toxoplasmosis during the first trimester, a high-risk period for congenital transmission. To determine if the neonate was infected in utero (congenital toxoplasmosis), one needs to detect antibodies produced by the fetus/neonate itself, not antibodies passively transferred from the mother. IgG antibodies readily cross the placenta. Therefore, detecting Toxoplasma-specific IgG (including subclasses IgG1 and IgG4) in the neonate simply reflects maternal IgG levels and does not confirm neonatal infection. IgM antibodies, however, do not cross the placenta. The presence of Toxoplasma-specific IgM in the neonate's serum indicates that the neonate's own immune system has responded to the infection, confirming congenital toxoplasmosis. IgA also does not cross the placenta well, and its presence could also indicate fetal production, but IgM is the primary marker for acute congenital infection detection. IgE is associated with parasites/allergy."

      "D. Treatment of the neonate's eyes with erythromycin",
      "E. Vaccination of the mother"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This neonate has bacterial meningitis presenting within the first week of life (early-onset). The CSF findings (low glucose, high protein, leukocytosis) and Gram stain (gram-positive cocci) strongly suggest Group B Streptococcus (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) as the cause. GBS is the most common cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis and meningitis, acquired during passage through the birth canal of a colonized mother. Standard prevention strategy involves screening pregnant women for GBS colonization late in gestation and administering intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), typically intravenous penicillin or ampicillin, to colonized women during labor. This significantly reduces vertical transmission and the incidence of early-onset GBS disease. Avoidance of deli meats (A) prevents Listeria. Enema (B) might reduce E. coli exposure. Eye treatment (D) prevents gonococcal/chlamydial conjunctivitis. Vaccination (E) is relevant for diseases like rubella or pertussis but not directly for GBS prevention currently (though vaccines are in development)."

    "explanation": "The patient presents with a subacute/chronic febrile illness characterized by malaise, drenching sweats (often nocturnal), weight loss, weakness, and an undulating (intermittent) fever pattern. His occupation as a veterinarian working with cattle places him at high risk for zoonotic infections. This clinical picture, particularly the undulating fever and constitutional symptoms in someone with cattle exposure, is highly characteristic of brucellosis, caused by Brucella species (B. abortus from cattle). Brucellosis is a systemic infection involving the reticuloendothelial system, often presenting as a fever of unknown origin. Diagnosis often relies on serology or blood/bone marrow culture.\nBacillus anthracis (A) causes anthrax (cutaneous, inhalation, GI). Coccidioides (C) causes valley fever (pulmonary/disseminated fungal infection). Erysipelothrix (D) causes localized skin infections (erysipeloid) in animal handlers.

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The combination of chronic diarrhea, fatigue, and megaloblastic anemia (indicated by low hemoglobin and macrocytic erythrocytes) in a fisherman from the Great Lakes region (Michigan) strongly suggests infection with the fish tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum. This tapeworm is acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing plerocercoid larvae. The adult tapeworm resides in the small intestine and competes with the host for dietary vitamin B12, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and potential neurological symptoms. Clonorchis sinensis (A, Chinese liver fluke) causes biliary disease. Echinococcus granulosus (C, dog tapeworm) causes hydatid cysts. Taenia saginata (D, beef tapeworm) and Taenia solium (E, pork tapeworm) cause taeniasis (intestinal infection) and potentially cysticercosis (T. solium only), but not typically vitamin B12 deficiency anemia."

    "explanation": "The finding of yellowish flecks (sulfur granules) on an IUD associated with vaginal discharge, along with the anaerobic growth of gram-positive branching rods, is characteristic of pelvic actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Actinomyces is an anaerobic bacterium that is part of the normal flora of the mouth, colon, and vagina. It can cause opportunistic infections, often associated with trauma or foreign bodies like IUDs. Actinomyces is also the classic cause of cervicofacial actinomycosis, commonly known as 'lumpy jaw', which typically arises after dental procedures or jaw trauma, presenting as a hard, non-tender swelling that eventually forms draining sinus tracts releasing sulfur granules. Atypical pneumonia (A) is caused by organisms like Mycoplasma. Gastroenteritis (B) has various causes. PID (D) is typically caused by Chlamydia/Gonorrhea. Thrush (E) is caused by Candida."

    "question": "An investigator isolates a cell protein that may be promising in cancer therapy. Messenger RNA from clones of cells producing this protein are collected. The investigator hopes to produce the gene responsible for this mRNA molecule so that the protein can be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Which of the following viruses has an enzyme that would be useful for this purpose?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenovirus",
      "B. Hepatitis B virus",
      "C. Measles virus",
      "D. Rubella virus",
      "E. Yellow-fever virus"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The investigator wants to synthesize a DNA copy (specifically, complementary DNA or cDNA) from an mRNA template. This process requires the enzyme reverse transcriptase (an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase). Reverse transcriptase is famously found in retroviruses (like HIV). However, it is also utilized by Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the Hepadnaviridae family. HBV is a DNA virus, but it replicates its DNA genome via an RNA intermediate, using its own reverse transcriptase enzyme. Therefore, reverse transcriptase derived from either retroviruses or HBV could be used for generating cDNA from mRNA in the laboratory. Adenovirus (A) is a DNA virus without RT. Measles (C), Rubella (D), and Yellow fever (E) are RNA viruses that replicate using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, not reverse transcriptase."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department afier experiencing a grand mal seizure. He recently returned from a 2-month vacation in Honduras. He has no history of any major medical iliness and takes no medications. He drinks alcohol occasionally but does not use illicit drugs. He appears alert and oriented and neurologic examination shows no abnormalities. A CT scan of the head shows multiple punctate calcifications and two cystic lesions with surrounding edema. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Contact with swine",
      "B. Exposure to a herding dog",
      "C. Exposure to a mosquito vector",
      "D. Ingestion of fruit contaminated with cow manure",
      "E. New pet in household"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with a new-onset seizure after traveling to an endemic area (Honduras). The CT scan findings of multiple calcifications and cystic brain lesions are highly suggestive of neurocysticercosis, the most common parasitic infection of the CNS worldwide. Neurocysticercosis is caused by infection with the larval stage (cysticercus) of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. Humans acquire intestinal taeniasis by eating undercooked pork containing cysticerci. Neurocysticercosis, however, results from ingesting T. solium eggs (passed in the feces of a human tapeworm carrier), typically via fecal-oral contamination of food or water. The ingested eggs hatch, larvae penetrate the intestine, and disseminate hematogenously, encysting primarily in the brain, muscles, and subcutaneous tissue. Contact with swine or consumption of improperly cooked pork infected with T. solium larvae is the ultimate source of the tapeworm in the human population, leading to egg shedding and subsequent transmission causing cysticercosis. Exposure to herding dogs (B) risks Echinococcus. Mosquitoes (C) transmit malaria/viral encephalitis. Contaminated fruit (D) can transmit various pathogens, but cysticercosis is specifically linked to T. solium eggs. New pets (E) could transmit Toxoplasma."
