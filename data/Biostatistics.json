    "explanations": {
      "A": "Plasma levels of acetone are actually increased during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), leading to the characteristic breath odor.",

      "A": "Albumin-bound free fatty acids primarily increase during fasting when stored fat is mobilized, not directly after a fatty meal in this condition.",
      "B": "Dietary triglycerides are packaged into chylomicrons by enterocytes. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) normally degrades triglycerides in chylomicrons circulating in the blood. Deficiency of LPL prevents this breakdown, leading to the accumulation of large, triglyceride-rich chylomicrons in the plasma after a fatty meal.",
      "C": "HDL is involved in reverse cholesterol transport and providing apolipoproteins, not directly carrying dietary fat from the intestine in this manner.",
