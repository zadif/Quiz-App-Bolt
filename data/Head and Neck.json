        "question": "A patient drinking hot tea at a restaurant experiences a bumning sensation at the tip of his tongue. This sensation is transmitted by which of the following?",
        "options": [
            "A. Trigeminal nerve",
            "B. Chorda tympani",
            "C. Glossopharyngeal nerve",
            "D. Hypoglossal nerve",
            "E. Vagus nerve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The innervation of the tongue is complex because it involves motor, general somatic sensory and special sensory functions. Somatic sensation includes pain, touch, temperature and pressure, the same sensations felt by the skin. The lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3), provides somatic sensory innervation to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. CN V3 also provides somatic sensory innervation to the skin of the face. The glossopharyngeal (CN IX) nerve provides somatic sensory innervation to the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.\n\n(Choice B) The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve that passes along the deep surface of the tympanic membrane and through the petrotympanic fissure before merging with the lingual nerve to deliver taste sensation to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue.\n\n(Choice C) The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) delivers somatic sensory and taste innervation to the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.\n\n(Choice D) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) innervates all intrinsic muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus muscle, which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X).\n\n(Choice E) The vagus nerve (CN X) innervates the palatoglossus muscle and carries taste signals from the pharynx and epiglottis. It does not carry taste signals from the tongue, however.\n\nEducational Objective:\nA branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) provides somatic sensory innervation to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve provides taste sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) provides somatic sensory and taste innervation to the posterior portion of the tongue."

            "E. Sphenopalatine",
            "F. Facial"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The patient described in the question stem has suffered a fracture where the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones meet in the skull. This site is known as the pterion and is medically relevant due to the fact that the bone is thin in this region and the middle meningeal artery courses within the skull deep to this point. As such, fractures to this region of the skull are at risk of damaging the middle meningeal artery and causing an epidural hematoma. Epidural hematomas require prompt treatment because they are under systemic arterial pressure and can expand rapidly leading to transtentorial herniation and palsy of the oculomotor nerve.\n\nThe middle meningeal artery is a branch of the maxillary artery, which itself is a branch of the external carotid artery.\n\n(Choice A) The occipital artery arises opposite the facial artery from the external carotid, coursing posteriorly instead of anteriorly. This vessel serves the posterior scalp and the sternocleidomastoids.\n\n(Choice C) The ophthalmic artery is the first branch of the internal carotid artery, serving the eye and orbital contents as well as the eyelids, forehead, nose, and nasal mucosa. The internal carotid artery has no branches in the neck.\n\n(Choice D) The middle cerebral artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies much of the parietal and temporal regions of the brain. Injury to this artery or its branches can cause a subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n(Choice E) The sphenopalatine artery is a branch of the third part of the maxillary artery that supplies much of the nasal mucosa. It anastomoses with branches of the ophthalmic and facial arteries within the anterior part of the nasal septum in a region known as Kiesselbach's plexus — a frequent site of nosebleeds.\n\n(Choice F) The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that courses over the mandible anterior to the insertion of the masseter muscle to supply the oral region and nose as well as the buccal region of the cheeks.\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe middle meningeal artery is a branch of the maxillary artery that enters the skull at the foramen spinosum and courses intracranially deep to the pterion. Skull fractures at this site may cause laceration of this vessel, leading to an epidural hematoma."

            "E. Cupula",
            "F. Auditory nerve"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Transduction of mechanical auditory forces into nerve impulses occurs in the organ of Corti by the following steps: 1) Sound reaches the middle ear by vibrating the tympanic membrane. 2) This vibration is transferred to the oval window by the ossicles. 3) Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the basilar membrane, which in turn causes bending of the hair cell cilia against the tectorial membrane. 4) Hair cell bending causes oscillating hyperpolarization and depolarization of the auditory nerve, thus creating nerve impulses from sound.\n\nNoise-induced hearing loss results from trauma to the stereociliated hair cells of the organ of Corti. Prolonged exposure to noises greater than 85 dB can cause distortion or fracture of the stereocilia due to shearing forces against the tectorial membrane. High-frequency hearing is lost first, regardless of the frequency of the sound causing the damage. Initial damage causes loss of hearing at frequencies of approximately 4000 Hz (speech frequencies = 500-3000 Hz). The acoustic reflex dampens the effects of prolonged loud noise by causing the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles to contract, lessening the responsiveness of the ossicles to sound.\n\n(Choice A) Perforation or rupture of the tympanic membrane can occur with infection, trauma, pressure changes when the eustachian tube is blocked, or sudden very loud noises. Rupture of the tympanic membrane causes conductive hearing loss.\n\n(Choice B) Defects of the middle ear ossicles such as otosclerosis can cause conductive hearing loss.\n\n(Choice C) The round window lies between the middle and inner ear and moves outward when the stapes causes the oval window to move inward and vice versa.\n\n(Choice E) The cupula lies at the apex of the cochlea and houses the cells that sense rotation.\n\n(Choice F) The auditory nerve transmits sound impulses to the brainstem via the 8th cranial nerve. Defects in this nerve can result from trauma, mass effect, demyelination, or local inflammatory processes, and can cause nerve-based hearing loss.\n\nEducational Objective:\nProlonged exposure to loud noises causes hearing loss due to damage of the stereociliated hair cells of the organ of Corti."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with Bell's palsy, an idiopathic paresis of the facial nerve. To understand the pathophysiology of Bell's palsy, it is important to understand the function of the facial nerve (CN VII). The facial nerve is a mixed nerve, consisting of the following:\n\n1. Motor output to the facial muscles\n2. Parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands\n3. Special afferent fibers for taste from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue\n4. Somatic afferents from the pinna and external auditory canal\n\nPatients with Bell's palsy typically present with sudden onset of unilateral facial paralysis. Specific findings include impaired eye closure, eyebrow sagging, inability to smile and frown on the affected side, disappearance of the nasolabial fold, and the mouth being drawn to the non-affected side. Patients afflicted with Bell's palsy may also have decreased tearing, hyperacusis, and/or loss of taste sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.\n\n(Choice A) Trigeminal nerve (CN V) somatic afferents are responsible for providing general sensation over the face; the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3) innervates the muscles of mastication and the tensor tympani.\n\n(Choice C) Palate elevation and the gag reflex involve the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves.\n\n(Choice D) Horner's syndrome occurs due to interruption of sympathetic innervation and clinically presents with ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis, and enophthalmos. Post-synaptic sympathetic axons travel in a perivascular plexus along the carotid arteries to reach and innervate the face.\n\n(Choice E) Taste sensation from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue is provided by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).\n\nEducational objective:\nIn addition to unilateral facial paralysis, patients with Bell's palsy may experience decreased tearing, hyperacusis, and/or loss of taste sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue."

Laryngeal edema can initially present with throat tightness, difficulty swallowing, dyspnea, and hoarseness. However, the condition can quickly progress to compromise the airway and cause asphyxiation.\n\nCricothyrotomy is indicated when an emergency airway is required and orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation is either unsuccessful or contraindicated (eg, due to massive hemorrhage, vomiting, facial trauma, or airway obstruction). The procedure establishes an airway through the placement of a tube between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages and requires an incision though the following structures:\n\n1. Skin\n2. Superficial cervical fascia (including subcutaneous fat and platysma muscle)\n3. Investing and pretracheal layers of the deep cervical fascia\n4. Cricothyroid membrane\n\n(Choice A) The buccopharyngeal fascia extends from the carotid sheath to invest the pharyngeal constrictor muscles. This fascial layer lies anterior to the prevertebral fascia, forming the retropharyngeal space between them. Infections involving the retropharyngeal space can extend directly into the superior mediastinum and cause acute necrotizing mediastinitis.\n\n(Choices B and C) The cricoid cartilage lies inferior to the thyroid cartilage at the level of C6 vertebra and the thyroid isthmus lies inferior to the cricoid cartilage. The cricothyrotomy incision does not pierce these structures.\n\n(Choice D) The deep cervical fascia is composed of three layers: investing, pretracheal, and prevertebral. The prevertebral layer of the deep fascia is not penetrated during cricothyrotomy.\n\nEducational objective:\nCricothyrotomy is indicated when an emergency airway is required and orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation is either unsuccessful or contraindicated.

        "explanation": "The superior thyroid artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, provide the blood supply to the thyroid and parathyroid glands. The superior thyroid artery, superior thyroid vein, and external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve course together in a neurovascular triad that originates superior to the thyroid gland and lateral to the thyroid cartilage. Because the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve courses just deep to the superior thyroid artery, it is at risk of injury during thyroidectomy. The cricothyroid muscle is the only muscle innervated by this nerve. The remaining laryngeal muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which also provide sensory innervation to the larynx below the vocal folds. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve does not innervate any muscles, but provides sensory innervation to the laryngeal mucosa above the vocal folds.\n\nLarynx (Vagus nerve)\nSuperior laryngeal nerve -> External branch -> Cricothyroid muscle\nSuperior laryngeal nerve -> Internal branch -> Sensory innervation above the vocal cords\nRecurrent laryngeal nerve -> All laryngeal muscles except cricothyroid & Sensory innervation below the vocal cords\n\n(Choices A, B, C and E) These muscles are all innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is at risk of injury during thyroidectomy due to its proximity to the superior thyroid artery and vein.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The orbit is bound superiorly by the thick orbital plate of the frontal bone and laterally by the thick bone of the zygoma and greater and lesser sphenoid wings. In contrast, the orbital floor is composed of a very thin layer of bone that separates the orbit from the air-filled maxillary sinus. Similarly, the orbit's medial wall is composed of the thin ethmoid and lacrimal bones, which separate it from the ethmoid air cells.\n\nBlunt trauma to the eye causes a rapid increase in pressure that typically does not rupture the globe but is transmitted posteriorly into the orbit. The weakest plates of bone in the orbit, the medial and inferior walls, are common sites of fracture. Fracture is typically evident on radiographic imaging, and fluid (blood) can usually be visualized in the normally air-filled adjacent sinuses. On the right side of the image above (corresponding to the patient's left side), the maxillary sinus (below the orbital floor) is filled with fluid.\n\n(Choice A) The ethmoid air cells are medial to the orbit. Here they are unaffected, but they can be affected in blowout fractures of the orbit's medial wall.\n\n(Choice C) The frontal sinus is not pictured above. It lies in the medial part of the supraorbital frontal bone.\n\n(Choice D) The sphenoid sinuses (not pictured above) lie anterior to the optic chiasm and are not in close relation to the orbit.\n\n(Choice E) The inferior nasal conchae form part of the nasal turbinate system. They are not air-filled sinuses.\n\nEducational Objective:\nBlunt trauma to the globe can cause orbital blowout fractures. These fractures most commonly involve the medial or inferior orbital walls, because the bone bordering the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses is thin."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The inferior thyroid artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk, a branch of the subclavian artery. Along with the superior thyroid arteries (branches of the external carotid arteries), the inferior thyroid arteries provide blood to the thyroid gland and other structures of the anterior neck.\n\nFrom the thyrocervical trunk, the inferior thyroid artery courses deep to the vagus nerve, common carotid artery and internal jugular vein before turning toward the thyroid. Just before meeting the thyroid gland, this artery courses just superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve that loops below the aortic arch on the left and below the subclavian artery on the right to provide motor innervation to the muscles of the larynx (all except the cricothyroid muscle). Unilateral injury to this nerve causes hoarseness; bilateral injury causes respiratory difficulty due to airway obstruction by immobile vocal folds.\n\n(Choice A) The superior laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve that gives off internal and external branches. The superior thyroid artery courses with the external branch of this nerve; ligation of this artery during surgery may damage the external laryngeal nerve.\n\n(Choice C) The ansa cervicalis is a loop of the cervical plexus that receives contributions from C1, C2 and C3. It courses deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and loops around the internal jugular vein. Branches from the ansa cervicalis innervate the sternohyoid, sternothyroid and omohyoid muscles.\n\n(Choice D) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) exits the cranium through the hypoglossal canal and innervates all of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus.\n\n(Choice E) The spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) exits the jugular foramen and courses on top of the levator scapulae muscle to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles on either side.\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe recurrent laryngeal nerve travels in close approximation to the inferior thyroid artery and can be injured in surgical procedures of the anterior neck (e.g. thyroidectomy), resulting in laryngeal muscle paralysis, hoarseness and dyspnea."

The Rinne and Weber tests can be used to help determine the type of hearing loss.\n\nThe Rinne test compares the perceived sound produced by a vibrating tuning fork when the stem is placed on the mastoid bone (bone conduction) versus when the tines are held near the external auditory meatus (air conduction). Air-conducted sound is normally louder and heard longer than bone-conducted sound. The Rinne test is considered positive (normal) if the sound is heard best at the external auditory meatus and negative (abnormal) if the patient hears the vibration better at the mastoid. An abnormal Rinne test suggests conductive hearing loss.\n\nThe Weber test also helps differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. It's performed by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the middle of forehead equidistant from both ears. The vibration is normally heard equally in both ears; vibration heard louder in 1 ear indicates an abnormal test. Conductive hearing loss causes lateralization to the affected ear as the conduction deficit masks the ambient noise in the room, allowing the vibration to be better heard. In contrast, sensorineural hearing loss causes lateralization to the unaffected ear as the unimpaired inner ear can better sense the vibration.\n\nThe Rinne test is abnormal in this patient's left ear, and the Weber test lateralizes to her left ear. These findings suggest conductive hearing loss in the left ear.\n\n(Choice A) Conductional loss in both ears would result in an abnormal Rinne test bilaterally and a normal Weber test.\n\n(Choice C) Conductional loss in the right ear would result in an abnormal Rinne test on the right and a Weber test that lateralizes to the right.\n\n(Choice D) Sensorineural loss in both ears would result in a normal Rinne test bilaterally and a normal Weber test.\n\n(Choice E) Sensorineural loss in the left ear would result in a normal Rinne test bilaterally and a Weber test that lateralizes to the right.\n\n(Choice F) Sensorineural loss in the right ear would result in a normal Rinne test bilaterally and a Weber test that lateralizes to the left.\n\nEducational objective:\nConductive hearing loss (bone conduction > air conduction): abnormal Rinne test (in affected ear) and Weber test localizes to affected ear.\nSensorineural hearing loss (air conduction > bone conduction): normal Rinne test and Weber test localizes to unaffected ear."

            "E. Stapes"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The inner ear is a fluid-filled site encased in bone that houses the cochlea, the semicircular canals, and the vestibule. The cochlea is a cone-shaped spiraling structure. The base of the cochlea is the widest section of the cone, and it lies near the oval and round windows. The apex of the cochlea is the tip of the cone, which lies near the helicotrema. The cochlea is composed of three spiraling fluid-filled ducts known as the scala vestibuli, the scala media, and the scala tympani. The scala media lies between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani are filled with perilymph, which has a high sodium concentration, while the scala media is filled with endolymph having a high potassium concentration. The scala media is separated from the scala tympani by the basilar membrane. The scala media is also unique in that it houses the tectorial membrane and the organ of Corti. The organ of Corti is the specific site where sound is transduced into the nervous system.\n\nThe transduction of mechanical auditory forces into nervous impulses occurs in the organ of Corti by the following steps. First, sound reaches the middle ear by vibrating the tympanic membrane. This vibration is transferred to the oval window by the ossicles. Vibration of the oval window causes movement of the perilymph in the scala vestibuli, which is transmitted to the scala tympani. Perilymph movement in the scala tympani, in turn, causes the flexible basilar membrane to vibrate. Vibration of the basilar membrane causes bending of the cilia of the hair cells as fluid runs past the rigid tectorial membrane. Hair cell bending causes oscillating hyperpolarization and depolarization, thus creating nervous impulses from sound. At the base of the cochlea, the basilar membrane is thin and rigid and best responds to high frequency sound. The basilar membrane at the apex of the cochlea, near the helicotrema, is large and flexible, so it best responds to low frequency sounds. The helicotrema is the site where the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani meet.\n\n(Choices A, B and C) The cochlear base lies near the round and oval windows; this segment of the cochlea best responds to high-frequency sound. Older adults do suffer from high-frequency hearing loss much more often than low-frequency loss. The oval window transmits vibration to the scala vestibuli, which communicates with the scala tympani at the helicotrema, which then transmits vibration to the round window. As the oval window moves inward, the round window moves outward.\n\n(Choice E) The stapes is one of the ossicles of the middle ear. The other two are the malleus and incus.\n\nEducational Objective:\nLow-frequency sound is best detected at the apex of the cochlea near the helicotrema. High-frequency sound is best detected at the base of the cochlea near the oval and round windows."

This may be the result of external compression, as by an apical lung tumor, or thrombotic occlusion, as can occur when a central catheter has been in place for an extended period of time. The right brachiocephalic vein is formed by the union of the right subclavian vein and the right internal jugular vein. The right external jugular vein drains into the right subclavian, so obstruction of the right brachiocephalic will cause venous congestion of structures drained by the external jugular. It is important to note that the right brachiocephalic vein also drains the right lymphatic duct, which drains lymph from the right upper extremity, the right face and neck, the right hemithorax, and the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.\n\n(Choice A) The internal jugular vein drains the brain and superficial face and neck. Obstruction of the internal jugular would not cause arm swelling.\n\n(Choice B) The external jugular vein drains the scalp and portions of the lateral face.\n\n(Choices C and F) The subclavian vein is the continuation of the axillary vein.

The signs and symptoms of SVC syndrome are similar to those described here, except that both sides of the face, neck and chest and both arms would be involved.\n\nEducational Objective:\nThe brachiocephalic vein drains the ipsilateral jugular and subclavian veins. The bilateral brachiocephalic veins combine to form the SVC. Brachiocephalic vein obstruction causes symptoms similar to those seen in SVC syndrome, but on just one side of the body."

        "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician complaining of a decrease in vision in her right eye that she noticed a week ago. She says that her sight in her right eye is \"narrower\" than in her left and seems to be “directed more towards the right.\" Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She also suffers from intermittent claudication and has had 2 prior episodes of transient vision loss in her right eye. Visual field testing reveals a right nasal hemianopia. CT scan of the head shows a calcified right internal carotid artery. Which of the following portions of the visual pathway is most likely disrupted in this patient? (Referring to labels A-H on a visual pathway diagram)",
        "options": [
           "A. A", "B. B", "C. C", "D. D", "E. E", "F. F", "G. G", "H. H"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Visual field defect Location of lesion Possible causes\nA. Monocular scotoma Partial lesion in the retina, optic disk, optic nerve | Macular degeneration, optic neuritis\nB. Right anopia Right optic nerve | Retinal artery or central retinal vein occlusion\nC. Bitemporal hemianopia Optic chiasm | Pressure exerted by a pituitary tumor, craniopharyngioma, aneurysm of anterior communicating artery\nD. Right nasal hemianopia Right peri-chiasmal lesion | Calcification or aneurysm of the internal carotid artery impinging on uncrossed, lateral retinal fibers\nE. Left homonymous hemianopia Right optic tract or optic radiation | Optic tract: occlusion of anterior choroidal artery; Optic radiation: occlusion of a middle cerebral artery branch or lesion involving posterior limb of internal capsule\nF. Left homonymous superior quadrantanopia (“pie in the sky”) Right temporal lobe (Meyer's loop) | Lesion or stroke involving temporal lobe\nG. Left homonymous inferior quadrantanopia (“pie on the floor\") Right parietal lobe (dorsal optic radiation) | Lesion or stroke involving parietal lobe\nH. Left homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing Right primary visual cortex (occipital lobe) | Occlusion of posterior cerebral artery. Macula is spared due to collateral blood from the middle cerebral artery\n\nHumans have a maximum horizontal field of view of about 200 degrees with both eyes. The central 120 degrees make up the binocular field of view (stereoscopic vision), with 2 side fields of about 40 degrees seen by only 1 eye (monoscopic vision). Unilateral visual defects within the binocular field of view (such as unilateral nasal hemianopia) may be masked due to compensation by the normal eye and go unnoticed by the patient.\n\nLight from the nasal visual field strikes the temporal side of each retina, and optic nerve fibers from the temporal part of the retina travel laterally through the optic chiasm to pass into the ipsilateral optic tract. Lesions involving the lateral aspects of the optic chiasm can cause nasal hemianopia by damaging these uncrossed, temporal retinal fibers. Aneurysm or atherosclerotic calcification of the internal carotid artery can induce a nasal defect by laterally impinging on the optic chiasm.\n\nThis patient's history of transient right-sided vision loss and head CT findings are consistent with significant right internal carotid artery atherosclerosis. Thus, extrinsic compression of the optic chiasm by the right internal carotid artery is the most likely cause of her symptoms.\n\n(Choice A) A lesion involving the retina is more likely to produce a focal monocular scotoma than nasal hemianopia, since the lesion would need to involve the entire temporal hemiretina in the latter.\n\nEducational objective:\nAneurysm or atherosclerotic calcification of the internal carotid artery can laterally impinge on the optic chiasm. This can cause nasal hemianopia by damaging uncrossed optic nerve fibers from the temporal portion of the ipsilateral retina."

        "question": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician complaining of double vision. She first experienced difficulty focusing her eyes while at work yesterday. Upon waking up this morning, her symptoms had progressed to frank diplopia. Her past medical history is insignificant. A complete physical examination is performed, including a full neurologic assessment. Shining light into her right eye causes constriction of her right pupil, but not the left pupil. Shining light into her left eye causes constriction of only her right pupil. Which of the following additional physical examination findings is likely to be found in this patient?",
        "options": [
            "A. Absence of the left corneal reflex",
            "B. Drooping of the left eyelid",
            "C. Inability to close the left eye",
            "D. Inward deviation of the left eye",
            "E. Visual loss in the left eye"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The pupillary light reflex is assessed by shining light in an eye and observing the response in that eye (direct) as well as the opposite eye (consensual). The optic nerve (CN II) is responsible for the afferent limb of this reflex; the oculomotor nerve (CN III) is responsible for the efferent limb. In this patient, the right CN II and right CN III are functional as there was a direct response seen when light was shined into the right eye. In addition, the left CN II is also functional as a consensual response occurred when light was shined into the left eye. However, constriction of the left pupil was not seen in either circumstance. Thus, this patient's lesion most likely involves her left CN III.\n\nThe symptoms of CN III palsy relate to the function of CN III:\n\n1. A somatic component innervates the inferior, superior, and medial rectus; inferior oblique; and levator palpebrae muscles. Ptosis occurs due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae, and the unopposed action of the lateral rectus (CN VI) and superior oblique (CN IV) muscles leads to a “down-and-out’ gaze.\n2. Parasympathetic fibers of CN III innervate the iris sphincter and ciliary muscle. Paralysis of these fibers causes a fixed, dilated pupil and loss of accommodation.\n\nCN III palsy can result from lesions anywhere along the nerve's path from the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain to the extraocular muscles within the orbit. The most dreaded cause of isolated acute third nerve palsy is an actively enlarging intracranial aneurysm (at risk of imminent rupture).\n\n(Choice A) Absence of the corneal reflex can result from lesions involving CN V1 (afferent limb) or CN VII (efferent limb).\n\n(Choice C) A lesion involving the left CN VII would result in inability to close the left eye.\n\n(Choice D) Inward deviation of the left eye would result from a CN VI lesion and the resultant unopposed action of CN III.\n\n(Choice E) The left CN II is functional as it was able to produce a consensual response in the right eye.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe pupillary light reflex is assessed by shining light in an eye and observing the response in that eye (direct) and the opposite eye (consensual). The optic nerve (CN II) is responsible for the afferent limb of the pupillary reflex, and the oculomotor nerve (CN III) is responsible for the efferent limb."

        "question": "A 62-year-old man comes to the physician complaining of double vision. He first noticed mild difficulty focusing his eyes about 3 weeks ago and his symptoms have progressively worsened. The patient's other medical problems include metastatic prostate cancer. On neurologic examination, he is unable to adduct his left eye, and stimulation of the left cornea does not elicit a corneal reflex. A lesion involving which of the following anatomical structures is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
        "options": [
            "A. Inferior orbital fissure",
            "B. Optic canal",
            "C. Superior orbital fissure",
            "D. Foramen rotundum",
            "E. Foramen lacerum",
            "F. Foramen ovale"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This patient's diplopia is caused by his inability to adduct his left eye. Eye adduction depends on the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and the medial rectus muscle. The oculomotor nerve originates in the oculomotor nucleus of the midbrain, emerges from the anterior midbrain, and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The patient also has loss of the corneal reflex on the left side. The sensory limb of the corneal reflex is mediated by the nasociliary branch of the first division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1). The motor component of the corneal reflex is carried primarily by the temporal branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). Like the oculomotor nerve, the nasociliary nerve enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Thus, a lesion involving the superior orbital fissure would cause the described deficits.\n\nThe trochlear nerve (CN IV), abducens nerve (CN VI), and superior ophthalmic vein also enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure.\n\n(Choice A) The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2), the infraorbital vessels, and branches from the sphenopalatine ganglion pass through the inferior orbital fissure but do not enter the orbit.\n\n(Choice B) The optic canal is medial to the superior orbital fissure and transmits only the optic nerve (CN II) and ophthalmic artery.\n\n(Choice D) The foramen rotundum transmits the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2) from within the skull to the pterygopalatine fossa. From there, it courses through the inferior orbital fissure to appear on the face at the infraorbital foramen as the infraorbital nerve.\n\n(Choice E) The foramen lacerum is occluded by cartilage. The internal carotid artery courses just superior to the foramen lacerum in the lacerum portion of the carotid canal.\n\n(Choice F) The mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) passes through the foramen ovale.\n\nEducational objective:\nThe oculomotor nerve (CN III), ophthalmic nerve (CN V1) branches, trochlear nerve (CN IV), abducens nerve (CN VI), and superior ophthalmic vein enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure."
