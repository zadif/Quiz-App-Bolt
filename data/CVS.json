    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of fever, chills, and malaise. Cardiac examination reveals a new holosystolic heart murmur that radiates toward the axila. Blood cultures are obtained and he undergoes transesophageal echocardiography. The ultrasound probe is placed in the mid-esophagus facing anteriorly and cardiac chambers are interrogated.\n\nItem 1 of 2\nAnatomically, which of the following chambers is closest to the probe?",
    "options": [
      "A. Left atrium",
      "B. Left ventricle",
      "C. Right atrium",
      "D. Right ventricle"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation suggests acute endocarditis, with confirmation pending the results of the blood cultures and cardiac imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) uses ultrasound waves generated from within the esophagus to produce clear images of the neighboring cardiac structures. The left atrium makes up the majority of the heart's posterior surface, with the esophagus passing immediately posterior to the heart. Therefore, the esophagus lies within closest proximity to the left atrium. This allows the left atrium, atrial septum, and mitral valve to be particularly well visualized on TEE. Due to its adjacent proximity conditions that result in left atrial enlargement (eg, atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis) can cause dysphagia through external compression of the esophagus.\n(Choice B) The left ventricle forms the apex and left border of the heart on frontal chest x-ray.\n(Choice C) The right atrium, along with the superior vena cava, forms the right lateral cardiac border on frontal chest x-ray.\n(Choice D) The right ventricle forms the anterior (sternal) surface of the heart and the majority of its inferior border.\nEducational objective:\nThe left atrium forms the majority of the posterior surface of the heart and resides adjacent to the esophagus. Enlargement of the left atrium can compress the esophagus and cause dysphagia."

Anatomically, which of the following will be best interrogated in this position?",
    "options": [
      "A. Descending aorta",
      "B. Pulmonary artery",
      "C. Pulmonary veins",
      "D. Superior vena cava",
      "E. Tricuspid valve"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The aorta has four major divisions: the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, the descending thoracic aorta, and the abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta lies posterior and to the right of the main pulmonary artery. The aortic arch travels above the right pulmonary artery and the left bronchus. The brachiocephalic, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries originate (in that order) from its superior aspect. The descending thoracic aorta abuts the left anterior surface of the vertebral column and lies posterior to the esophagus and the left atrium. This permits clear visualization of the descending aorta during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), allowing for the detection of abnormalities such as dissection or aneurysm. The descending thoracic aorta continues to travel down the left anterior surface of the vertebral column, becoming the abdominal aorta as it crosses the diaphragm and eventually branching into the common iliac arteries.\n(Choice B) The main pulmonary artery ascends anteriorly and to the left of the ascending aorta and is directed toward the left shoulder. After the pulmonary artery bifurcates, the right pulmonary artery travels horizontally under the aortic arch posterior to the superior vena cava and the left pulmonary artery courses superiorly over the left main bronchus.\n(Choice C) The superior and inferior pulmonary veins arise bilaterally from each lung and enter the left atrium. The proximal 2-3 cm of the pulmonary veins contain cardiac muscle within the media and function like sphincters during atrial systole.\n(Choice D) The superior vena cava (SVC) is formed behind the right 1st costal cartilage by the merger of the right and left brachiocephalic veins. It returns blood from the head, neck, and upper extremities to the right atrium of the heart. Mediastinal neoplasms can compress the SVC and result in SVC syndrome.\n(Choice E) The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and right ventricle and is composed of 3 valve leaflets, the annulus, supporting chordae tendineae, and the papillary muscles. It is commonly infected (endocarditis) in IV drug users.\nEducational objective:\nThe descending thoracic aorta lies posterior to the esophagus and the left atrium. This position permits clear visualization of the descending aorta by transesophageal echocardiography, allowing for the detection of abnormalities such as dissection or aneurysm."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease comes to the physician complaining of progressive exertional shortness of breath, fatigue, and lower extremity swelling. His medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction 5 years ago and an electronic pacemaker implanted 2 years ago. His chest x-ray is shown below. A segment of one of the leads is highlighted (arrow).\n\nThe highlighted segment most likely lies within which of the following structures?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anterior interventricular sulcus",
      "B. Atrioventricular groove",
      "C. Pulmonary artery",
      "D. Right atrium",
      "E. Right ventricle"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has a biventricular pacemaker, a device that requires 2 or 3 leads. If 3 leads are used, the first 2 are placed in the right atrium and right ventricle. The third lead is used to pace the left ventricle. Right atrial and ventricular leads are easy to place as they only need to traverse the left subclavian vein and superior vena cava to reach these cardiac chambers. In contrast, the lead that paces the left ventricle is more difficult to position. The preferred transvenous approach involves passing the left ventricular pacing lead from the right atrium into the coronary sinus, which resides in the atrioventricular groove on the posterior aspect of the heart. It is then advanced into one of the lateral venous tributaries in order to optimize left ventricular pacing.\n(Choice A) The anterior interventricular sulcus courses toward the apex of the heart on its anterior surface. The anterior descending vessels lie in this sulcus.\n(Choice C) The pulmonary artery lies just to the left of center on the anterior surface of the heart. It courses from the right ventricle toward the aortic arch. Swan-Ganz catheters traverse the pulmonary artery.\n(Choices D & E) The right atrium and ventricle are visible on the rightmost section of the cardiac silhouette.\nEducational objective:\nLeft ventricular leads in biventricular pacemakers course through the coronary sinus, which resides in the atrioventricular groove on the posterior aspect of the heart."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is evaluated for nonspecific, chronic abdominal pain. An axial computed tomography image of his abdomen is shown below.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the structure indicated by the arrow?",
    "options": [
      "A. It drains into the left subclavian vein in the thorax",
      "B. It drains through the cystic duct into the common bile duct",
      "C. It gives rise to the right and left renal arteries",
      "D. It is formed by the union of the common iliac veins",
      "E. It joins the splenic vein to form the portal vein"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This axial CT image shows the abdomen near the L1 vertebral level. At this level, the renal arteries originate from the aorta. The inferior vena cava (IVC) [indicated by the arrow] lies just anterior to the right renal artery and to the right of the aorta. The IVC is formed by the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the level of L4-L5 and drains into the right atrium just above the level of the diaphragm at T8. The IVC returns venous blood to the right atrium from the lower extremities, portal system, and abdominal and pelvic viscera.\n(Choice A) The thoracic duct drains lymph from the entire left side of the body and all regions inferior to the umbilicus (including the gut structures). It enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus and empties into the left subclavian vein near its junction with the internal jugular vein.\n(Choice B) The cystic duct drains bile from the gallbladder into the common bile duct. The plane of this cross-sectional image is too low to see the gallbladder, but in higher sections it can be seen just below the liver in the anterior right abdomen.\n(Choice C) The image shows the abdominal aorta giving rise to the right and left renal arteries. The abdominal aorta lies posteromedial to the IVC within the abdomen.\n(Choice E) The superior mesenteric vein (SMV) joins the splenic vein to form the portal vein. The SMV can be seen vaguely near the head of the pancreas in this cross-sectional image.\nEducational objective:\nThe inferior vena cava (IVC) is formed by the union of the right and left common iliac veins at the level of L4-L5. The renal arteries and veins lie at the level of L1. The IVC returns venous blood to the heart from the lower extremities, portal system, and abdominal and pelvic viscera."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man comes to the emergency department complaining of fever, chills, and dyspnea on exertion. He admits to smoking one pack of cigarettes a day, consuming 2-3 alcoholic beverages daily, and using intravenous illicit drugs 2-3 times per week. He is febrile and tachycardic. Blood cultures grow Staphylococcus aureus. A diagnosis of infective endocarditis is established. The valve most likely affected in this patient can be best evaluated by auscultation in which of the following areas? [Image shows auscultation areas A(Aortic), B(Pulmonic), C(Tricuspid), D(Mitral)]",
    "options": [
      "A. A",
      "B. B",
      "C. C",
      "D. D"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Right-sided endocarditis involving the tricuspid valve commonly occurs in IV drug users and is most often due to Staphylococcus aureus. Specifically, infective endocarditis can cause tricuspid regurgitation, which is identified as an early systolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border (Tricuspid area - marked C) that is accentuated by inspiration.\nHeart sounds/murmurs result from reverberation of blood secondary to valve closure. Auscultation to determine function of a valve is performed at the position closest to where the sound waves reverberate and not at the position of the valve.\nAortic valve: Second right intercostal space at the right sternal border (A).\nPulmonic valve: Second left intercostal space at the left sternal border (B).\nTricuspid valve: Fourth left intercostal space at the lower left sternal border (C).\nMitral valve: Fifth left intercostal space, medial to the mid-clavicular line (D).\nEducational objective:\nAn early systolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border that is accentuated by inspiration is most likely due to tricuspid regurgitation."

    "question": "A 54-year-old male presents to your office complaining of periodic, tight, burning substernal chest pain. A thallium stress test shows hypoperfusion of the cardiac muscle forming the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. Which of the following coronary arteries is most likely occluded in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Left anterior descending coronary artery",
      "B. Left circumflex coronary artery",
      "C. Left main coronary artery",
      "D. Right coronary artery",
      "E. Acute marginal branches"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The right and left main coronary arteries arise directly from the root of the aorta and provide the blood supply to the heart. The left main coronary artery divides into the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex coronary arteries, which supply most of the anterior and left lateral surfaces of the heart. In 85-90% of individuals, the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior descending artery (PDA). These patients are said to have right dominant coronary circulation. In approximately 10% of patients, the posterior descending artery arises from the circumflex branch of the left main coronary artery; these patients have left dominant circulation. The posterior descending artery supplies most of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, which forms the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The right coronary artery also gives rise to the SA and AV nodal arteries in most patients. Since hypoperfusion is seen on the diaphragmatic surface (inferior wall), occlusion of the artery supplying the PDA is likely. In most people (right dominant), this is the right coronary artery.\n(Choice A) The LAD coronary artery normally supplies the anterior 2/3 of the interventricular septum, the anterior wall of the left ventricle, and part of the anterior papillary muscle.\n(Choice B) The left circumflex coronary artery supplies the lateral and posterior superior walls of the left ventricle via obtuse marginal branches.\n(Choice C) The left main coronary artery gives rise to the LAD and left circumflex coronary arteries. It only gives rise to the posterior descending artery in about 10% of individuals, and thus is not the artery most likely occluded here.\n(Choice E) The acute marginal branches arise from the right coronary artery to supply the wall of the right ventricle. They may provide collateral circulation in patients with LAD occlusion.\nEducational Objective:\nThe inferior wall of the left ventricle forms most of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. The posterior descending artery supplies this area. In 85-90% of individuals, the posterior descending artery derives from the right coronary artery."

    "question": "A 34-year-old female is being evaluated for progressive exertional shortness of breath. She has no past medical history and does not take any medications. She does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. An echocardiographic study suggests coronary sinus dilation. Which of the following best explains this finding?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aortic dissection",
      "B. Coronary artery disease",
      "C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "D. Pulmonary hypertension"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The coronary sinus serves as the endpoint of venous drainage from the coronary blood supply. Since it contains deoxygenated blood it drains into the right atrium. The coronary sinus is usually not visible by echocardiography in most normal, healthy patients. The most common cause of coronary sinus dilatation evident on echocardiography is elevated right-sided heart pressure secondary to pulmonary artery hypertension. Since the coronary sinus communicates freely with the right atrium, it will become dilated by any factor that causes dilatation of the right atrium.\n(Choice A) Aortic dissection often occurs in patients with hypertension. Such patients might have elevated left heart pressures, but not elevated right-sided heart pressures to cause dilatation of the coronary sinus.\n(Choice B) Coronary artery disease typically results in less coronary artery flow, meaning less blood in the coronary sinus and hence a smaller size. The only mechanism by which coronary sinus dilatation might result from coronary artery disease would be if myocardial ischemia culminated in pulmonary artery hypertension and thus elevated right heart pressures.\n(Choice C) Complications from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often stem from left ventricular outflow obstruction. Coronary sinus dilatation should not occur unless there is superimposed heart failure.\nEducational objective:\nThe coronary sinus communicates freely with the right atrium and therefore may become dilated secondary to any factor that causes right atrial dilatation. The most common such factor is pulmonary artery hypertension, which leads to elevated right heart pressures."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to worsening shortness of breath for the last 2 days. His symptoms occurred initially with exertion, but now they occur even at rest. He says that he could not sleep last night because of a suffocating cough that occurred each time he tried to lie down. He has a family history of asthma. His blood pressure is 172/110 mm Hg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 26/min. His chest x-ray is shown below.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute respiratory distress syndrome",
      "B. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis",
      "C. Left ventricular failure",
      "D. Obstructive bronchial disease",
      "E. Primary pulmonary hypertension",
      "F. Tension pneumothorax"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with progressive dyspnea and orthopnea (cough when lying down). His chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly (heart > 1 hemithorax in size), increased vascular shadowing (alveolar edema) in a 'batwing' peri-hilum pattern, and blunting of the costophrenic angles (pleural effusions). These findings are characteristic of acute left ventricular failure, and result from increased left atrial and ventricular filling pressure (increased preload). This increased pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary capillaries, causing fluid transudation into the pulmonary interstitial and alveolar spaces (cardiogenic pulmonary edema).\nCommon triggers for acute heart failure include myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), and drug use (eg, cocaine). Patients with acute heart failure complain of cough, dyspnea, and fatigue, which can rapidly become more severe. They are typically tachypneic and may be using accessory muscles to breathe. Chest examination usually reveals crackles and sometimes wheezing (cardiac asthma) due to edema of the bronchial airways. The chest x-ray can also show Kerley B lines, short horizontal lines situated perpendicularly to the pleural surface that represent edema of the interlobular septa.\n(Choice A) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results from endothelial injury and leakage of fluid from capillaries. It has an acute onset and is characterized by bilateral patchy airspace disease on chest x-ray. It is caused by an inciting factor such as sepsis, aspiration, pneumonia, or trauma. ARDS can be distinguished from cardiogenic pulmonary edema by the absence of jugular venous distension and cardiomegaly.\n(Choice B) The chest x-ray in idiopathic interstitial fibrosis (referred to histologically as usual interstitial pneumonia) shows reticular, net-like, opacities involving the lung bases. Most patients present with slowly progressive dyspnea and a nonproductive cough.\n(Choice D) Obstructive pulmonary diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are associated with hyperinflated lungs and a flattened diaphragm.\n(Choice E) The chest x-ray in primary pulmonary hypertension reveals enlargement of the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle, which is not evident in this patient.\n(Choice F) The diagnosis of pneumothorax is confirmed by the presence of a white visceral pleural line on chest x-ray. Pulmonary vessels are not visible beyond the visceral pleural boundary. The mediastinum is often shifted away from the affected side.\nEducational objective:\nThe chest x-ray in acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema shows cardiomegaly (heart > 1 hemithorax in size), pleural effusions, Kerley B lines, and increased vascular shadowing (alveolar edema) bilaterally."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of exertional chest pain. He undergoes coronary angiography and is found to have severe stenosis of the right coronary artery, left anterior descending, and circumflex coronary arteries. He is referred to a surgeon for coronary artery bypass grafting. During the procedure, a portion of his great saphenous vein is removed and grafted to 1 of his diseased coronary arteries to bypass its atherosclerotic narrowing. The saphenous vein can be best harvested from which of the following sites?",
    "options": [
      "A. Just superior to the inguinal ligament",
      "B. Just inferior to the anterior superior iliac spine",
      "C. Just inferolateral to the pubic tubercle",
      "D. At the midline of the popliteal fossa",
      "E. Over the lateral aspect of the foot"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "When the left anterior descending artery (LAD) alone is occluded by an atherosclerotic plaque, the left internal mammary artery (left internal thoracic artery) is the preferred vessel for bypass grafting because it has superior short- and long-term patency rates compared to saphenous vein grafts. For cases in which there are multiple coronary arteries or vessels other than the LAD requiring revascularization, saphenous vein grafts are routinely used.\nThe great saphenous vein is located superficially in the leg and is the longest vein in the body. It courses superiorly from the medial foot, anterior to the medial malleolus, and up the medial aspect of the leg and thigh. In the proximal anterior thigh 3-4 centimeters inferolateral to the pubic tubercle, the great saphenous vein dives deep through the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening to join the femoral vein. Surgeons commonly access the great saphenous vein in the medial leg or at its point of origin in the upper thigh near the femoral triangle. The femoral triangle is bordered by the inguinal ligament superiorly, sartorius muscle laterally, and adductor longus muscle medially.\n(Choice A) The deep circumflex iliac vessels course parallel to and just superior to the inguinal ligament. The superficial and inferior epigastric veins course above the midportion of the inguinal ligament.\n(Choice B) No major vessels are located immediately inferior to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). The ASIS serves as the superior attachment of the inguinal ligament, and a penetrating injury to the region below the ASIS could damage the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh.\n(Choice D) The popliteal artery and vein course centrally through the popliteal fossa together with the tibial nerve. Common medical problems that occur in the popliteal fossa include popliteal artery aneurysms, which account for the majority of peripheral artery aneurysms, and synovial (Baker) cysts, which are commonly associated with arthritis.\n(Choice E) The small saphenous vein can be found at the lateral aspect of the foot. This vein courses posteriorly to drain into the popliteal vein.\nEducational objective:\nThe great saphenous vein is a superficial vein of the leg that originates on the medial side of the foot, courses anterior to the medial malleolus, and then travels up the medial aspect of the leg and thigh. It drains into the femoral vein within the region of the femoral triangle, a few centimeters inferolateral to the pubic tubercle."

    "options": [
      "A. Pulmonary trunk",
      "B. Right ventricle",
      "C. Left atrium",
      "D. Left ventricle",
      "E. Inferior vena cava"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A penetrating injury at the left sternal border in the fourth intercostal space (level of the nipple) will pass through the following layers: Skin and subcutis, Pectoralis major muscle, External intercostal membrane, Internal intercostal muscle, Internal thoracic artery and veins, Transversus thoracis muscle, Parietal pleura, Pericardium, Right ventricular myocardium.\nIt is important to know that the right ventricle composes the majority of the anterior surface of the heart. The left lung would not be punctured by a stab wound in this location because there is no middle lobe on the left side, and the superior lobe of the left lung is displaced laterally by the cardiac impression.\n(Choice A) The pulmonary trunk could be pierced by a penetrating injury to the second intercostal space at the left sternal border.\n(Choice C) The left atrium is located at the base of the heart and makes up most of the heart's posterior surface. Only the auricle of the left atrium is visible anteriorly (protruding between the pulmonary trunk and the left ventricle).\n(Choice D) The left ventricle composes the left lateral aspect of the heart. A stab wound in the fourth intercostal space in the midclavicular line could potentially strike the left ventricle, but only after passing through the bulk of the left lung.\n(Choice E) The inferior vena cava passes through the right side of the central tendon of the diaphragm at the level of T8. A stab wound to the back to the immediate right of the vertebral bodies could strike the IVC, but the injury described above would be unlikely to.\nEducational Objective:\nA penetrating injury at the left sternal border in the fourth intercostal space would puncture the anterior surface of the heart. The right ventricle composes most of the heart's anterior surface."

      "B. B",
      "C. C",
      "D. D"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient presents after trauma with signs/symptoms consistent with likely aortic rupture, which is most commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents. A motor vehicle accident with sudden deceleration can cause different rates of deceleration between the heart (in a fixed position) and the aorta. The most common site of injury is the aortic isthmus (site C on the figure), which is the relatively fixed portion of the aorta just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, near the insertion of the ligamentum arteriosum. This area is susceptible to shearing forces during rapid deceleration.\nPatients typically present with chest pain, back pain, or shortness of breath. However, there can be significant rupture, causing instant death after the trauma. Patients who survive the initial rupture may have a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray.\n(Choice A) Site A on the figure shows where the coronary arteries come off the aorta (aortic root). This is not a usual location for traumatic rupture.\n(Choice B) Site B on the figure shows the proximal aortic arch. This is a common site for aortic aneurysms from other causes, such as hypertension, syphilis, or vasculitis. It is a less common site for traumatic rupture.\n(Choice D) Site D represents the descending thoracic aorta further down. Traumatic rupture can occur here; however, it is a less common site for rupture than is the aortic isthmus.\nEducational objective:\nAortic rupture is most commonly due to motor vehicle accidents, and the most common site of injury is the aortic isthmus, which is the connection between the ascending and descending aorta distal to where the left subclavian artery branches off the aorta."

Inferior vena cava filters are used to prevent pulmonary embolism in patients who have contraindication to anticoagulation (like this patient with recent GI bleed) or who have recurrent PE despite anticoagulation. This abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is taken at the level of L2.
