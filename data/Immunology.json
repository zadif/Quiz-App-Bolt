    "explanations": {
      "A": "Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) often involves IgG antibodies, the production of which (beyond IgM) requires T-helper cell function, which is deficient in DiGeorge syndrome.",
      "B": "Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) production requires thymic education and selection, which is absent or severely impaired in DiGeorge syndrome.",
      "C": "Delayed-type hypersensitivity (Type IV) is dependent on T-helper 1 (TH1) cells and macrophages, both requiring functional T cells derived from the thymus.",
      "D": "This infant has DiGeorge syndrome, characterized by thymic aplasia due to failure of the 3rd/4th pharyngeal pouches. Most T cells (alpha-beta T cells) require thymic development. However, gamma-delta T cells develop independently of the thymus. Therefore, their numbers are likely to be normal.",

      "C": "Natural Killer (NK) cells can produce IFN-gamma, but in the context of adaptive immunity driving granuloma formation against intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium leprae (causing leprosy), TH1 cells are the primary source.",
      "D": "This patient likely has leprosy, characterized by granuloma formation against the acid-fast bacilli. Granulomas are orchestrated by T-helper lymphocytes, specifically the TH1 subset. TH1 cells secrete interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which is the key cytokine that activates macrophages, causing them to enlarge, increase phagocytic/killing capacity, and transform into epithelioid cells characteristic of granulomas.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanations": {
      "A": "C1q is the recognition component of the classical pathway, binding to immune complexes to initiate the cascade.",
      "B": "C3b, generated by the cleavage of C3 via either the classical or alternative pathway, plays multiple crucial roles. It covalently binds to immune complexes (and microbial surfaces), acting as a major opsonin recognized by CR1 receptors on phagocytes (facilitating clearance by liver/spleen macrophages) and erythrocytes (transporting complexes). C3b deposition also helps keep immune complexes soluble. Deficiencies in C3 or components leading to C3b generation often result in susceptibility to immune complex diseases.",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Three weeks and three injections after the beginning of the experiment, the animals will have undergone a full primary immune response fo the BSA, along with isotype-switching of those antibodies from IgM to IgG. The response to KLH at 7 days after its first injection will be a primary immune response, with anti-KLH IgM predominating. IgM is always the first antibody produced in response to any antigen, and IgG is the most common secondary immune response antibody unless a mucosal surface is involved, in which case IgA might predominate in the secondary and all subsequent responses. IgG against BSA (choice A) will certainly be present in these animals due to the multiple repeated inoculations over a 3-week period, but the animals will also be making a primary immune response (IgM) to the first injection of KLH. IgG against BSA and KLH (choice C) is not correct, since 7 days after the first injection of KLH a primary immune response will just be beginning. It is not possible for the isotype switch of anti-KLH antibodies to have occurred at this time. However, IgG against BSA will be found. IgG and IgM against BSA (choice D) is a possible but incomplete answer. There should be low-level production of IgM against BSA in these animals. but since affinity maturation improves the binding strength of populations of antibodies during the burst of clonal proliferation and subsequent natural selection. it is unlikely that these antibodies will have high titers in the serum compared with those of the high-affinity IgG molecules. Furthermore, this answer does not acknowledge that a primary response against KLH would be happening in these animals at the same time. IgM against BSA (choice E) is not correct because after 3 weeks and three inoculations, the animals should have finished their primary immune response (IgM) and be well into their secondary response (IgG). IgM against BSA and IgG against KLH (choice F) is not correct and is the opposite of what would be expected. IgM is the primary immune response antibody and IgG is the secondary immune response antibody. BSA in these animals should be a secondary response (even a tertiary response) and KLH should be a primary response."

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (choice B) destroy host cells that have antigen epitopes presented in association with class | major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. An example would be a virus-epitope from a virus-infected cell presented by class | molecules on the surface of the cell. LAK cells (choice C) are natural killer (NK) cells that have been activated by IL-2. They are considered to be superactivated NK cells. NK cells kill altered self cells such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells. NK cells (choice D) are cells of the innate immune system that destroy virus-infected cells or tumor cells. This does not involve antibody and it does not involve extracellular pathogens."

    "question": "A 56-year-old woman is diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. Treatment is begun with an in vitro culture of peripheral leukocytes in the presence of TH1 cytokines, followed by reinfusion into the circulation. After 2 years of remission, the patient returns to the physician for a follow-up examination. A CT scan of the chest shows renewed tumor growth in both lungs. Treatment with the previous therapy is repeated. however, it has no effect on tumor size. Which of the following has most likely been lost from the surface of the tumor cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. CD3",
      "B. CD4",
      "C. CD8",
      "D. HLAA B. and C",
      "E. HLA DP, DQ, and DR"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Tumor-specific killer cells could describe either cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or natural killer (NK) cells. Of the two, only the CTLs would lose their activity if a surface molecule was lost, namely major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class | antigens. NK cells would actually be stimulated by the loss of MHC class |, so they could not be the cells to which the question refers. Tumor antigens may be present in the groove of the class | MHC molecule of transformed cells. These are presented to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which recognize the MHC class I/peptide complex on the cell surface and kill the tumor cell. Loss of this molecule would therefore prevent the tumor cell from being killed. The MHC class | molecule is described as a two-chain structure, with one of the chains (beta-2 microglobulin) holding the other chain (alpha chain) in its needed configuration on the cell surface. In the human, class | MHC molecules are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. The T-cell signal transduction molecule, or CD3 (choice A) is a marker on all T cells. It is not involved in antigen recognition. This molecule would not be on the surface of tumor cells unless the malignant cells themselves were T lymphocytes. The co-receptor for MHC class II molecules, or CD4 (choice B) , would not be on the surface of this tumor cell. but it would be on the surface of a helper T lymphocyte. The co-receptor for MHC class | molecules, or CD8 (choice C) would not be on the surface of this tumor cell, but it would be on the surface of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte. HLA DP, DQ, and DR are the MHC class II molecules in humans (choice E). These are not involved in killing of tumor cell targets. They present peptide fragments (derived from intracellular killing of extracellular organisms by macrophages) to CD4+ (helper) T lymphocytes."

    "question": "During an investigational study, blood from a healthy volunteer is analyzed by flow cytometry. The relative proportion of all cells bearing surface immunoglobulin in the circulation is evaluated. Which of the following cell surface markers should be used to identify the B cells in this blood sample?",
    "options": ["A. CD3", "B. CD4", "C. CD8", "D. CD19", "E. CD56", "F. IgM"],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The best markers for identification of B cells are CD19, CD20, and CD21. The CD21 molecule is a receptor for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The CD3 marker (choice A) is present on all T cells. This is the marker that is used to identify total T cell count in a blood sample. CD3 is the signal transduction molecule on T cells. The CD4 marker (choice B) is used to identify T-helper (TH) cells. These are the cells that recognize exogenous peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules by macrophages. CD4+ TH cells are also involved in cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity, production of cytokines for stimulation of antibody production by B cells, and stimulation of macrophages. The CD8 marker (choice C) is used to identify cytotoxic T cells. These are the cells that recognize viral epitopes attached to the MHC class | molecules of a virus-infected cell. The CD56 marker (choice E) is used to identify natural Killer (NK) cells. These cells are important in innate host defense, specializing in killing virus-infected cells and tumor cells by secreting granzymes and perforins. IgM (choice F) is present on mature naive B lymphocytes along with IgD, but would not be present on any memory cells. Therefore, to receive an idea of the proportion of all immunoglobulin-bearing cells in the circulation, IgM determination would not be the best choice."

He says that he has experienced this numerous times in the past. One year later, he participates in a clinical immunologic study. A flow cytometric measurement of T cells shows values within the normal range. An increased serum concentration of which of the following cytokines is most likely to decrease the likelihood of a contact dermatitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gamma interferon",
      "B. IL-2",
      "C. IL-5",
      "D. IL-8",
      "E. IL-10"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. IL-10 is produced by T-helper 2 (TH2) cells and inhibits T-helper 1 (TH1) cells. Since the cytokines from TH1 cells stimulate cell-mediated immunity and delayed hypersensitivity, an increased level of IL-10 would decrease the likelihood of contact dermatitis, which is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Other cytokines from TH2 cells stimulate B cells to produce antibody. Gamma-interferon (choice A) from TH1 cells inhibits TH2 cells. It also activates natural killer (NK) cells and activates macrophages. This cytokine would make a contact dermatitis worse, not better. IL-2 (choice B) stimulates the TH1 subset, CD8 T cytotoxic cells, and activates NK cells. It causes cloning of the cells of cell-mediated immunity, and thus would make a contact dermatitis worse. IL-5 (choice C) is secreted by TH2 cells and promotes B-cell proliferation, IgA synthesis in the submucosa, and eosinophil production in the bone marrow. It does not have a direct effect on TH1 function. IL-8 (choice D) is produced by macrophages and is chemotactic for neutrophils. This cytokine is most important in stimulating an inflammatory reaction and in attraction of neutrophils to the site."

      "C. Hypochlorite",
      "D. Myeloperoxidase",
      "E. NADPH oxidase"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This child has chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is a genetic defect in one or more of the subunits of NADPH oxidase. Activation of this membrane-bound oxidase is the critical first step in the generation of toxic oxygen radicals within the phagolysosome. One of the products of this reaction, hydrogen peroxide, serves as the substrate for the second most important killing mechanism: myeloperoxidase acting to produce toxic halide radicals. Patients with CGD are prone to persistent infections with catalase-positive bacteria and fungi, because these organisms destroy the hydrogen peroxide that they produce metabolically, so neither of the oxygen-dependent mechanisms can function in intracellular killing during these infections. Defensins (choice A) are part of the oxygen-independent mechanisms of phagocytic killing. These make up the largest number of different antimicrobial mechanisms used by phagocytes, but there are no known disease states that result from such deficiencies. Hydrogen peroxide (choice B) is the substrate for the myeloperoxidase enzyme system. It is produced inside the cell by the activation of NADPH oxidase, but it is also produced by aerobic microorganisms as a byproduct of their metabolism. Hypochlorite (choice C) is a toxic product arising in the myeloperoxidase arm of the intracellular killing pathway when myeloperoxidase acts on hydrogen peroxide to produce toxic halide radicals. Myeloperoxidase (choice D) is an enzyme present in neutrophils that acts on hydrogen peroxide to produce toxic halide radicals such as hypochlorite."

Serum analysis by an indirect fluorescent antibody test shows a speckled staining pattern due to anti-Sm. Which of the following is most likely to additionally be present in this patient?",

      "D. complement-mediated lysis of blood vessels in the face",
      "E. Epstein-Barr virus infection"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototype connective-tissue disease. The diagnosis requires that four out of 11 possible criteria be met: malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis, serositis, renal disorder, neurologic disorder, hematologic disorder, immunologic disorder, and antinuclear antibody (ANA). This patient also has anti-Sm, which is pathognomonic for SLE but is found in only 30% of the affected patients. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) are present in 95 to 100% of SLE cases; anti-double stranded DNA is found in 70% of cases. The vasculitis and rash of SLE are associated with immune complex deposition in the small-diameter blood vessels, followed by complement-mediated lysis. Antibodies to centromeres (choice A) are found in 90% of patients with limited scleroderma or CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud syndrome, esophageal dysmotility, scleroderma, telangiectasias). They would be found in less than 5% of patients with SLE. Antibodies to the glomerular basement membrane (choice B) are found in Goodpasture syndrome. This causes the linear disposition of immunoglobulin, and often C3, along the glomerular basement membrane. It results in glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and occasionally idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. Antibodies to SS-A ribonucleoproteins (choice C) are found in Sjogren syndrome, which is characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. The secondary form of this disease may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, polymyositis, scleroderma vasculitis, mixed connective tissue disease, or thyroiditis. Antibodies to core proteins of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (Smith antigen) are found in 20 to 30% of SLE patients, and antibodies against SS-A ribonucleoproteins are found in 30 to 50% of patients with SLE. Epstein-Barr virus infection (choice E) has been suggested as being linked to the development of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This condition, which is of unknown etiology, involves severe mental and physical exhaustion that is not relieved by rest and may be worsened by even trivial exertion. The symptoms must be present for at least 6 months and must be idiopathic. Other signs that are not included in all diagnostic criteria may be found, including muscle weakness, cognitive dysfunction, hypersensitivity, orthostatic intolerance, digestive disturbances, depression, poor immune response, and cardiac and respiratory problems."

An MRI of the brain is shown. An increased concentration of which the following is most likely to be important in the pathogenesis of the lesions shown in the MRI?",
    "options": [
      "A. Immunoglobulin G",
      "B. Immunoglobulin M",
      "C. Interferon-gamma",
      "D. Interleukin-10",
      "E. Transforming growth factor-beta"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The symptoms and MRI shown are typical of multiple sclerosis, which is a demyelinating disease of autoimmune pathology. Multiple sclerosis is characterized microscopically by plaques with a central loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin but with relative preservation of axons. The plagues are surrounded by a peripheral rim of lymphocytes and increased astrocytes. The disease appears to be initiated by CD4+ TH1 lymphocytes that react against self myelin antigens and secrete cytokines such as interferon-gamma to activate macrophages. The activated macrophages are responsible for the demyelination. The disease is therefore classified as an example of a type IV hypersensitivity disease. Immunoglobulin G (choice A) may be present near multiple sclerosis plagues but its role in demyelination is unclear. IgG may be involved in type II and type III hypersensitivities, where antibodies bind to either fixed (type II) or circulating (type III) antigens to activate complement and start inflammation. In myasthenia gravis, for example, antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor in the neuromuscular junction cause abnormal function of the motor end plate and eventual inflammatory destruction of the area. Immunoglobulin M (choice B) could be found near multiple sclerosis plagues but it is not believed to play a role in the disease. IgM production is a cause of some type III hypersensitivities, such as rheumatoid arthritis, where circulating complexes of IgM against one’s own IgG (rheumatoid factor) begin to block the small-diameter blood vessels and activate complement, ultimately resulting in inflammatory damage. Interleukin-10 (choice D) is a product of TH2 lymphocytes that inhibits the cell-mediated immune response. It is unlikely to be produced near the location of an active TH1 response such as a multiple sclerosis plague. Interleukin-10 could be produced in type II or type III hypersensitivities when antibody production is stimulated, but is not likely to be produced in a type IV hypersensitivity, which is due to activation of TH1 cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (choice E) is a product of TH2 cells that encourages B-cell isotype-switching, and is not likely to be produced near the plagues of multiple sclerosis. This cytokine could potentially be produced in cases of hypersensitivities involving antibodies (types I, II, and III) but would not be present in cell-mediated hypersensitivities such as this one."

    "options": [
      "A. Infected APCs have viral peptides in class | MHC molecules",
      "B. Infected APCs have viral peptides in class || MHC molecules",
      "C. Normal APCs have normal peptides in class || MHC molecules",
      "D. Normal APCs have viral peptides in class | MHC molecules",
      "E. Normal APCs have viral peptides in class || MHC molecules"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ cells) recognize the target they intend to kill by binding their T-cell receptor to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class | molecule of the target cell. Cells infected with intracellular pathogens will have peptides in the groove of MHC class | on their surface, reflecting the fact that abnormal proteins are being produced internally. If an antigen-presenting cell (APC) has ingested a cell that has died of virus infection, the viral peptides will be presented in the context of the class II MHC molecule, and this will serve as the stimulatory signal for T-helper (TH) cells to begin producing stimulatory cytokines. Thus, APCs will bear viral peptides in the context of class II MHC, whereas the infected target cell can be identified by finding viral peptides in the groove of the class | MHC. If there were not separate mechanisms for MHC molecules involved in cell-cell cooperation versus cytotoxic killing, CD8+ cells would kill the APCs necessary for 'turning on' the TH response. Infected APCs having viral peptides in class II MHC molecules (choice B) is not correct. If APCs were both infected and acting as antigen presenters, they could have viral peptides in the context of both classes of MHC molecules, but the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) identifies its target via class I/peptide combinations. Normal APCs having normal peptides in class II MHC molecules (choice C) is not correct. Uninfected APCs will have the groove of class II MHC molecules loaded with peptides from materials they have digested previously. Materials presented in the class II groove are not targets for cytotoxic killing by T cells. Normal APCs having viral peptides in class | MHC molecules (choice D) is not correct. Only infected APCs will have viral peptides in the class | MHC groove. Normal APCs having viral peptides in class II MHC molecules (choice E) is true, but this will not serve as the signal for CTL targeting. Any uninfected APC that has digested a virus-infected cell may express viral peptides in the class II molecule, but this serves as the stimulus for TH cells, not CTLs, to become activated."

      "A. Anaphylatoxins",
      "B. Eosinophil chemotactic factor-A",
      "C. Histamine",
      "D. Interleukin-4",
      "E. Interleukin-8"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This child is suffering from the results of mast cell degranulation in response to histamine. Histamine, heparin, and eosinophil-chemotactic factor-A are found in preformed mast cell granules. These granules are released in response to physical injury, heat, cold, type | hypersensitivity reactions, C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins, proteins released from leukocytes, substance P, and melitin found in bee venom. In the present case, the direct degranulation of mast cells by melitin and subsequent release of histamine is the most direct cause of the boy's symptoms. Histamine is the principal mediator of the immediate transient phase of increased permeability of venules in acute inflammation, an effect mediated by H1 histamine receptors. Anaphylatoxins (choice A), another name for the complement components C3a and C5a, are substances produced in areas of acute inflammation that cause mast cell degranulation. Although they would contribute to these symptoms, they are not likely to be the most direct cause in the present case. Eosinophil chemotactic factor-A (choice B) is actually multiple substances that are preformed in mast cells and would be released in the area of this bee sting. They are not the most direct cause of this boy's symptoms. The attraction of eosinophils into areas of mast cell degranulation is important in cases in which the pathogen is a helminth, since eosinophils contain major basic protein, which is damaging to the cuticles of most helminths. Interleukin (IL)-4 (choice D) is produced by TH2 cells and is involved in causing isotype-switching in B lymphocytes to the production of IgE. Although IgE is an important cause of mast cell degranulation in type | hypersensitivities, it would be produced in the sensitization phase of a type | hypersensitivity, not in the actual symptomatic phase. IL-8 (choice E) is a product of macrophages and can cause mast cell degranulation, but it is not likely to be the most direct cause in this case."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man is brought into court for nonpayment of child support. His ex-wife states that he is the father of her child, although he denies it. The court orders genetic tests, including one for genetic immunoglobulin identification of the mother, father, and child. Which of the following immunoglobulin markers is likely to be most useful in this paternity case?",
    "options": ["A. Allotype", "B. Idiotype", "C. Isotype", "D. Subisotype"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Allotypes are genetically inherited markers (amino acid sequence differences) that occur within the constant domains of both heavy and light chains of immunoglobulin molecules. They reflect the paternity of the individual, and are similar in concept to the ABO blood group alloantigens: they do not affect the function of the cell that bears them, but simply reflect patterns of inheritance. These are distinctive markers that, when present, can be helpful in paternity cases. If this man had these markers and the child had the same markers, then this would be presumptive evidence that the man is the child's biologic father. Other genetic tests would also performed in this case, because if the mother and father happened to have the same markers, then the findings could be nonconclusive. Idiotypes (choice B) are the antigen-recognition portions of the immunoglobulin molecule that are unique for specific antigens to which we have been exposed. Since every antibody molecule has a different idiotype (antigenic specificity) unless it has been made by a clone of cells, these would not be useful in determining paternity. The isotypes (choice C) are the five major classes of immunoglobulin: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. They are distinct from one another based on amino acid sequences in the constant domains of both heavy and light chains. Isotypes would not be helpful for a paternity case. Subisotypes (choice D) are subclasses within the isotypes of antibodies. IgG has four subisotypes and IgA has two subisotypes. They are distinguished on the basis of amino acid sequences in the constant domains of heavy chains and would not be useful in determining paternity."

    "options": ["A. CD3", "B. CD4", "C. CD8", "D. CD14", "E. CD20", "F. CD56"],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The disease in question is leprosy, or Hansen disease. Mycobacterium leprae has a predilection for the skin and cutaneous nerves, thereby producing the symptoms of depigmentation and anesthetic cutaneous lesions. This loss of peripheral nerve function leads to many of the disfiguring features of the disease: because the patients do not have normal pain sensation, they sustain repeated injuries. In addition, the organism attacks cartilage and causes granuloma formation in the skin, leading to some of the facial damage. The multinucleated giant cells that form in leprosy are modified macrophages or epithelioid cells. They possess CD14, the endotoxin receptor on their cell surface as well as CD16, the Fc receptor for the Fc tail of immunoglobulin G. CD3 (choice A) is the signal transduction complex molecule in T lymphocytes. Although T cells would be found in the granulomatous lesions of tuberculoid leprosy, these are not the cells that become multinucleated giant cells in these areas. CD4 (choice B) is the specific marker on the surface of T-helper lymphocytes. It would not be found on the multinucleated giant cells found in leprosy. CD8 (choice C) is the specific marker on the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These are not the cells that fuse together in the lesions of leprosy. CD20 (choice E) is part of the signal transduction complex in B lymphocytes. It would not be found on the surface of modified macrophages. CD56 (choice F) is one of two markers used to identify natural killer (NK) cells in tissues. The other marker on NK cells is CD16, the Fc receptor, by which NK cells carry out antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cells do not fuse together to form multinucleated giant cells in leprosy."

      "D. Plasma cells",
      "E. Suppressor T cells"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. CD4 and CD8 are both markers for T cells, and mature T cells express one or the other but not both. However, some of the immature T cells in the thymus (which can 'leak' into the baby's blood in small numbers) coexpress these markers before the cells have 'committed' to being either helper T (TH) or cytotoxic T cells. In adults, significant numbers of cells coexpressing CD4 and CD8 usually implies the existence of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a cell population similar to immature T cells. Normally, T-cell precursors entering the thymus are double-positive for CD4 and CD8. During thymic selection, cells that recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II become CD4-positive only and differentiate into TH lymphocytes, whereas cells that recognize MHC class | become CD8-positive only and differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Helper T cells (choice A) are CD4+ and CD8-. Suppressor T cells (choice E) are CD4- and CD8+. Immature B cells (choice B) and plasma cells (choice D) are both CD4- and CD8-, since these are T-cell markers."

      "C. Generation of H2O2",
      "D. Production of HOCI",
      "E. Transfer of lysosomal enzymes to phagosomes"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Phagocytosis is followed by rapid activation of oxygen-dependent enzymatic reactions referred to as the oxidative burst, which leads to generation of reactive oxygen radicals capable of killing bacteria. NADPH oxidase plays a fundamental role in the oxidative burst. NADPH oxidase is a multiprotein complex that oxidizes NADPH, producing superoxide anions (·O2−) from molecular oxygen. Superoxide anions then convert to H2O2 by spontaneous dismutation. Hydrogen peroxide serves as the substrate for myeloperoxidase, which then acts to produce toxic halide radicals. This child has chronic granulomatous disease, a group of congenital disorders characterized by defective bacterial killing and chronic predisposition to infections with catalase-positive microbes. Patients with CGD are prone to persistent infections with catalase-positive bacteria and fungi, because these organisms destroy the hydrogen peroxide that they produce metabolically, so neither of the oxygen-dependent mechanisms can function in intracellular killing during these infections. Other conditions due to defective leukocyte functions include genetic deficiencies in leukocyte adhesion molecules (leukocyte adhesion deficiencies 1 and 2; LAD1 and LAD2), which impair leukocyte adhesion and transmigration (choice A), leading to recurrent infections and defective wound healing. LAD1 is due to genetic alterations in the beta chain of the integrin. LAD2 is due to absence of sialyl-Lewis X, a carbohydrate that binds selectins expressed on activated endothelium. Chemotaxis (choice B) is impaired in a number of acquired conditions, including diabetes mellitus, malignancy, thermal injury, and sepsis. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency is a genetic condition characterized by absence of MPO and deficient production of HOCI (choice D). Myeloperoxidase converts H2O2 to HOCI in the presence of Cl−. HOCI is one of the most powerful bactericidal agents, killing bacteria by halogenation and oxidation of macromolecules. Patients with MPO deficiency tend not to be symptomatic unless they have a simultaneous inability to generate NADPH oxidase. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a deficiency in the transfer of lysosomal enzymes into phagosomes (choice E). This defect also affects melanocytes, nerve cells, and platelets, resulting in a peculiar constellation of clinical features, i.e., susceptibility to infections, albinism, nerve deficits, and a bleeding diathesis."

      "A. Interferon-gamma",
      "B. Interleukin-1",
      "C. Interleukin-2",
      "D. Nitric oxide",
      "E. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The patient had tuberculosis, and the lesions described here are granulomas, more specifically, they are caseating granulomas due to mycobacterial infection. Granulomatous inflammation is a specialized, immune-mediated form of chronic inflammation resulting from complex interactions between the cells involved in cell-mediated immunity, including TH1 lymphocytes and macrophages. The ultimate effect is the development of activated macrophages, which acquire an epithelial-like appearance (epithelioid macrophages) and may fuse to form multinucleated giant cells. This process begins with the uptake of foreign antigens by macrophages, which process and present them to helper T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes activate macrophages through interferon (IFN)-gamma and they become epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells. Epithelioid macrophages secrete interleukin-1 (choice B) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (choice E), which increase leukocyte recruitment locally and mediate the systemic acute-phase responses (e.g., fever, malaise). Macrophages release a large number of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for tissue damage, necrosis of parenchymal cells, and subsequent reparative fibrosis. However, the question asks which mediator causes the production of epithelioid macrophages, not which cytokines epithelioid macrophages produce. Interleukin-2 (choice C) is a product of TH cells, which stimulate cell proliferation. Macrophages are end-cells that are incapable of proliferation, thus they would not be affected by IL-2 production. Macrophages also produce nitric oxide (NO) (choice D), which plays an important role in microbial killing but may also result in tissue damage through generation of NO-related free radicals. Again, the question asks which mediator causes the production of epithelioid macrophages, not which products epithelioid macrophages produce."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man is found to be HIV-positive after a sexual encounter with a prostitute. He states that he did not have any symptoms during the period immediately after the encounter. During the asymptomatic phase of this infection, the virus is found in association with which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. B lymphocytes",
      "B. Follicular dendritic cells",
      "C. Ganglion cells",
      "D. Oligodendrocytes",
      "E. Peripheral nerves"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of lymph nodes are important reservoirs of HIV. Although some follicular dendritic cells are infected with HIV, most viral particles are found on the surface of their dendritic processes. Follicular dendritic cells have receptors to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins that serve to trap HIV virions coated with anti-HIV antibodies. These coated HIV particles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes (choice A) have a surface marker (CD21 protein, a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind. The virus associates with the host DNA, producing a latent infection. These cells may undergo polyclonal activation and proliferation, resulting in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 primarily affects the mouth and lips, causing 'cold sores'. It resides in the trigeminal ganglion and remains latent until reactivated. HSV type 2 primarily infects the genitals. Both types can infect the ganglion cells (choice C) in the CNS, causing a fatal encephalitis. Oligodendrocytes (choice D) are centrally affected by two viruses: JC virus (a polyomavirus) and measles virus. JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Measles virus produces a persistent, nonproductive infection of the CNS, leading to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Peripheral nerves (choice E) are affected by HIV virus in the AIDS-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy. This disease is characterized by subacute onset of proximal muscle weakness, sometimes with pain, and elevated levels of creatine kinase. The muscles and nerves are infiltrated with mononuclear cells, including HIV-positive macrophages."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of a pruritic, linear, vesicular rash on her leg. The rash developed 2 days after she returned from a hiking trip. She says that it began as a swollen. erythematous streak that developed into extremely itchy blisters and that she has experienced similar episodes in the past. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the development of this rash in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antigen-antibody complexes formed in the circulation and deposited in the tissue",
      "B. Cytotoxic antibodies against cell surface antigens",
      "C. IgE antibody-mediated basophil degranulation",
      "D. Release of histamine from mast cells",
      "E. Release of interferon-gamma from activated TH1 cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This woman most likely has been exposed to poison ivy, which caused a contact, type IV cell-mediated sensitivity response to urishiol, an oil found in poison ivy. Contact with this oil leads to a reaction that appears as a linear, streak-like rash in sensitized individuals. Redness, swelling, and pruritic blisters occur at the sites of contact. Sensitivity usually develops after the first contact with poison ivy, and the reaction described typically occurs after subsequent exposures. Antigenic activation of TH1 lymphocytes causes the production of interferon-gamma, which stimulates macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes to destroy the oil-coated cells. This reaction does not require the formation of antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes formed in the circulation and deposited in the tissue (choice A) underlie type III hypersensitivity reactions. Diseases mediated by this type of hypersensitivity include systemic lupus erythematosus and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Cytotoxic antibodies against cell surface antigens (choice B) produce type II hypersensitivity reactions. Diseases mediated by this type of hypersensitivity include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pemphigoid, pemphigus, and Goodpasture disease. IgE antibody-mediated basophil degranulation (choice C) and the release of histamine from mast cells (choice D) are the mechanisms responsible for type | immediate hypersensitivity reactions. IgE antibodies are formed in response to exposure to a specific antigen. Re-exposure to that antigen results in the cross-linking of the IgE molecules on the surface of mast cells and basophils, and subsequent degranulation to release mediators that cause the classic manifestations of type | hypersensitivity reactions. Examples are hives, hay fever, and anaphylactic reactions."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of recurrent infections. He has a history of infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that have occurred over the past 6 months. Laboratory studies show total immunoglobulin levels greater than 900 mg/dL and decreased C3 levels. To which of the following does this patient have an increased susceptibility?",
    "options": [
      "A. Human immunodeficiency virus-1",
      "B. Measles virus",
      "C. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare",
      "D. Type lll hypersensitivity",
      "E. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Individuals with C3 deficiency have an increased susceptibility to immune complex diseases (type III hypersensitivity). The most important functions of C3 are removing immune complexes from the bloodstream and enhancing opsonization. Type III hypersensitivity reactions result from immune complexes of self or foreign antigens bound to an antibody; these will activate complement, leading to tissue damage. Examples of type III hypersensitivity reactions include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (choice A), which is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an intracellular pathogen that depends on the activation of TH1 cells and their cytokines for a protective immune response. A patient with C3 deficiency would not be expected to be any more susceptible to an intracellular pathogen such as this one than the population at large would be. Measles (choice B) is caused by rubeola virus, which is an intracellular pathogen and would not be affected by deficiencies in complement. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (choice C) is an intracellular bacterium that infects phagocytic cells. It is controlled by a cell-mediated response, not a complement-mediated response. Type IV hypersensitivity (choice E) is a disease that depends on the action of TH1 cells, macrophages, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It does not depend on the presence of antibody and complement."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The most important chemotactic factors for neutrophils are the complement factor C5a and the interleukin IL-8. The cytokines IL-1 and TNF (choice B) are products of activated macrophages and endothelial cells, among others. They have multiple, often similar actions, including stimulation of production of many acute-phase reactants, stimulations of fibroblasts, and stimulation of endothelial expression of adhesion molecules. Leukotrienes LTC4 and LTD4 (choice C) cause increased vascular permeability. Prostaglandins PGI2 and PGD2 (choice D) mediate vasodilation and pain. Thromboxane and Platelet activating factor (choice E) promote vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation."

      "D. Neutrophils",
      "E. T cells"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. A wide variety of defects related to complement can occur and can produce immunodeficiency. The pattern of recurrent Neisseria (gram-negative diplococcus) infections described here is typical of deficiency of complement factors C6, C7, or C8. Other complement deficiencies produce the following patterns: Deficiency of C1q produces a combined immunodeficiency with a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome. Deficiency of C1rs, C1s, C4, or C2 produces an SLE-like syndrome and glomerulonephritis. Deficiencies of C3 or C3b produce a tendency to pyogenic infections. No disease has yet been associated with C9 deficiency. B-cell deficiencies (choice A) occur in a number of conditions and tend, in general, to be associated with an increased susceptibility to extracellular organisms. Eosinophil deficiency (choice C) is not a usual cause of immunodeficiency, but it would impair the normal protective response against parasites. Neutrophil abnormalities (choice D) are associated with increased susceptibility to extracellular microorganisms. T-cell deficiencies (choice E) may present as severe combined immunodeficiencies or with infections with opportunistic organisms such as Candida, Pneumocystis, or Cytomegalovirus."

      "C. Immunoglobulin E",
      "D. Immunoglobulin G",
      "E. T-helper 1 cells",
      "F. T-helper 2 cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This man, immunosuppressed to prevent rejection of his transplanted heart, has developed cerebral toxoplasmosis as evidenced by the multiple ring-enhancing lesions seen on MRI. This is a common occurrence in the immunocompromised, since Toxoplasma gondii is so common worldwide. It is estimated that up to 70% of the population of the United States is seropositive, so reactivation of cysts held in latency by a normal immune response becomes commonplace as the immune response declines. Toxoplasma is an intracellular protozoan parasite in the human. Cats act as the definitive host of the parasite and shed infectious forms in their feces. Intracellular pathogens are best controlled by cell-mediated immune responses. These responses are orchestrated by T helper-1 (TH1) cells. The effector mechanisms include cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages and cells capable of mounting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Complement (choice A) is a set of serum proteins that act to opsonize or lyse microbes in a cascading fashion to culminate in the production of a membrane attack complex that will lyse whatever particle has started the cascade. Complement acts primarily against extracellular agents, as it is not active against intracellular microbes. Immunoglobulin A (choice B) is the immunoglobulin found on the mucosal surfaces. Although Toxoplasma organisms are ingested across a mucosal surface, within the human, they exist as intracellular cysts. Intracellular organisms are not affected by the presence of IgA. IgE (choice C) is an immunoglobulin that can mediate ADCC against parasites, but it is elicited against helminth parasites and not intracellular protozoa such as Toxoplasma. IgG (choice D) is the most abundant antibody in the serum, but antibodies do not play a role in protection against intracellular organisms. TH2 cells (choice F) are important in humoral immunity, but do not usually play important roles against intracellular pathogens."

Which of the following best explains this patient's repeated infections?",
    "options": [
      "A. Defective chemotactic response",
      "B. Defective NADPH oxidase",
      "C. Deficiency of C5",
      "D. IgA deficiency",
      "E. Thymic hypoplasia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. A history of recurrent infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus sp. suggests a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is caused by a deficiency of NADPH oxidase inside phagocytic cells. In the absence of NADPH oxidase, phagocytes cannot generate toxic oxygen metabolites in the phagolysosome, and patients become susceptible to catalase-positive infections, particularly those caused by S aureus, Aspergillus sp., Nocardia, Salmonella, and Candida. The reason these patients have difficulties with catalase-positive microbes is that catalase production will destroy any hydrogen peroxide created during the metabolism of aerobic bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide is the substrate for myeloperoxidase (the second oxygen-dependent intracellular killing mechanism). Catalase-mediated destruction of hydrogen peroxide in a CGD patient will therefore eliminate the function of both oxygen-dependent mechanisms. In about 2/3 of patients the inheritance is X-linked and so the disease usually affects males, but the remainder of cases are autosomal recessive and can occur in females. Defective chemotactic responses (choice A) are seen in diseases such as alcoholism and diabetes mellitus. Defective chemotaxis would lead to increased susceptibility to a broad range of pathogens, and not just the catalase-positive ones listed in this case. Deficiency of C5 (choice C), a complement component, would make patients prone to infection by gram-negative bacteria, especially Neisseria species. IgA deficiency (choice D) represents the most common primary immunodeficiency and would present with an increased predisposition to autoimmune diseases, infections, and atopy. Thymic hypoplasia (choice E) is caused by defective development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, leading to decreased T-cell levels and making patients more prone to viral and fungal infections. Patients may also exhibit hypocalcemia and other signs of parathyroid insufficiency."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man develops scrotal inflammation, itching, localized scrotal swelling, and tenderness of his inguinal lymph nodes 4 months after returning from a trip to Africa. A blood smear is positive for microfilariae. Which of the following immune mechanisms does the body use against the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and causing death of the cells or tissues",
      "B. Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and changing the function of the tissue",
      "C. IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells and basophils",
      "D. Immune complex deposition in tissues",
      "E. T cell-mediated activation of macrophages"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This patient is infected with a filarial parasite such as Wuchereria or Brugia. Filarial parasites have a complex life cycle, beginning with transmission by mosquitoes or other arthropods. The adult worms elicit an inflammatory reaction in the lymphatics, eventually leading to lymphatic obstruction and edema. Microfilariae produced by the adults circulate in the bloodstream until they are ingested by the arthropod vector and develop over 1 to 2 weeks into new infective larvae. The body reacts to tissue parasites, such as filarial worms, by coating them with a thin layer of IgE molecules, which triggers eosinophil-mediated cytotoxicity and the release of vasoactive and spasmogenic substances from mast cells and basophils (local anaphylaxis, a form of type | hypersensitivity). Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and causing death of the cells or tissues (choice A) is a cytotoxic type II hypersensitivity reaction. Transfusion reactions due to mismatched blood are an example. Antibodies binding to cells or tissues and changing the function of the tissue (choice B) is a type II non-cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction. Graves disease and myasthenia gravis are examples. Immune complex deposition in tissues (choice D) is an example of a type III hypersensitivity. It usually takes the form of vasculitis secondary to deposition of circulating antigen-antibody complexes. The Arthus reaction is a specific variant of these reactions in which local vasculitis leads to tissue injury and necrosis, often in the skin. T cell activation of macrophages (choice E) is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The reaction is common with facultative intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes."

The physician explains that desensitization therapy can potentially help control these symptoms. In this type of therapy. which of the following will most likely prevent the allergen from reacting with a specific IgE molecule present on mast cell membranes?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antihistamine",
      "B. Blocking antibody",
      "C. Cromelyn sodium",
      "D. Epinephrine",
      "E. Theophylline"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Blocking antibody is generally an IgG antibody against the allergen. It is induced in the allergic patient by administering small amounts of allergen over a period of time. When the person is again exposed to the allergen, the IgG reacts with the allergen before it can reach the IgE-coated mast cell. Antihistamines (choice A) would block histamine receptors but would not react with the allergen before it could reach the IgE-coated mast cell. Cromolyn sodium (choice C) is a drug that stabilizes mast cell membranes, thus inhibiting degranulation, but would have no effect on allergen binding to IgE on mast cells. Epinephrine (choice D) is the mainstay of therapy in severe cases of immediate hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis). It increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), thus decreasing mast cell degranulation, and causes smooth-muscle dilation in the airways. Epinephrine would have no effect on the binding of the allergen to IgE on mast cells. cAMP is degraded in cells by the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Theophylline (choice E) inhibits this enzyme, thereby increasing mast cell cAMP levels and making degranulation less likely without affecting the binding of the allergen to IgE on mast cells."

      "B. Type | hypersensitivity",
      "C. Type Il hypersensitivity",
      "D. Type lll hypersensitivity",
      "E. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Urticaria (hives), which this patient has, is a good example of a local anaphylactic reaction, which is classified as a type | hypersensitivity reaction. Type | hypersensitivity reactions involve preformed IgE antibody bound to mast cells or basophils, which then release vasoactive and spasmogenic substances when they react with the allergen. Antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (choice A) occurs when antibodies bound to the Fc receptors of various cells (monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils) target cells, tissues, or pathogens for destruction. It is not involved in the production of urticaria. Type II hypersensitivity (choice C) is caused by autoantibodies against cells or tissues. When these antibodies activate complement or promote phagocytosis, the tissue is damaged. Type III hypersensitivity (choice D) is caused by immune complex deposition in the small diameter blood vessels and the subsequent activation of complement and destruction of the vasculature. The tuberculin (PPD) reaction, used to test for tuberculosis exposure, is an example of delayed-type, or type IV, hypersensitivity (choice E). This response involves TH1 cells and the effector cells of cell-mediated immunity and requires 48 to 72 hours after a second and subsequent exposure to elicit maximum expression."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The symptoms described in the question are classic for CREST syndrome. This condition is an example of localized scleroderma with slow progression to life-threatening complications. CREST syndrome is the combination of calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. Anticentromere antibodies are reported in a high percentage of patients who have CREST syndrome, but only in a small percentage of pure scleroderma patients. Centromeres are the portion of the chromosome where spindle fibers attach during cell division. Antihistone antibody (choice B) is a marker for drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Drugs that can induce systemic lupus erythematosus are hydralazine, isoniazid, and procainamide. Anti-SS-A (choice C) is a marker for Sjogren syndrome, which is characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth. Anti-SS-B (choice D) is an autoantibody directed against ribonucleoproteins and is a marker for Sjogren syndrome. Rheumatoid factor (RF) (choice E) is generally an IgM autoantibody directed against the Fc portion of IgG. RF is found in 80% of patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and may also be found in low titers in patients who have chronic infections, other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren syndrome, or chronic pulmonary, hepatic, or renal diseases."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient is suffering from Goodpasture syndrome, which results from autoantibodies to type IV collagen. This results in antibodies binding to the basement membranes in the kidney and lungs, resulting in nephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. This is an example of a type II cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction. Anti-double stranded DNA (choice A), Anti-Sm, and ANA could be used as markers for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). ANA markers are the most sensitive markers for SLE, whereas anti-double stranded DNA and anti-Sm are more specific markers for SLE. Anti-double stranded DNA levels correlate with disease activity and kidney involvement in some patients who have SLE. Lupus is a type III (immune complex) hypersensitivity that may cause vascular damage from complement-mediated lysis anywhere there are small diameter blood vessels. SLE is more common in females than males and would be likely to have the additional manifestations of rash and arthritis.

Interleukin (IL)-2, which is produced by T-helper (TH) cells, causes activation and cloning of many categories of lymphocytes and has been used to treat various types of cancer. In this case, it would be expected to increase numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural Killer cells, both of which may have benefit in the battle against malignant cells.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This man has the symptoms of a 'typical' pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The chest x-ray shows consolidation of the right lower lobe. Typical pneumonia is characterized by high fever, lobar consolidation, and productive sputum. These symptoms are a result of the primary responding immune cell, the neutrophil, which enters the area, releases pyrogenic products (fever), causes innocent bystander damage to the lung (sputum), and creates abscesses (lobar consolidation). Most agents causing typical pneumonia are extracellular organisms, which possess molecules that are chemotactic for neutrophils (f-Met peptides, peptidoglycan, teichoic acids). B lymphocytes (choice A) are most frequently found in the secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes and spleen). They are not primarily associated with the pathology of typical pneumonia, although antibodies and complement will eventually assist in neutrophil phagocytosis of the causal organism. Eosinophils (choice B) predominate in lesions that are either parasitic or allergic in nature. Since neither of these is the case here, they would not be expected to predominate in these lesions. Macrophages (choice C) are called into areas of infection by the cytokines produced by T lymphocytes. Macrophages and T lymphocytes are responsible for the pathology in atypical pneumonias but not in the pathology of typical pneumonia, which usually does not persist long enough for the neutrophil population to be replaced by macrophages. T lymphocytes (choice E) are stimulated by presentation of antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. They are thus primarily stimulated by intracellular pathogens, whose antigens are presented in the groove of the MHC class II molecule of various phagocytic cells. This reaction is responsible for the production of alveolar septa swollen with mononuclear cells, which is the primary manifestation of an atypical pneumonia."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The patient has malaria, which is caused by four species of intraerythrocytic protozoa belonging to the genus Plasmodium. The erythrocytic stage of malaria would have to be cleared by natural killer (NK) cells due to the lack of MHC molecules on red blood cells (RBCs). The most important protective mechanism in malarial infections is antibody, complement, opsonization and lysis in the spleen, but if a cell-mediated mechanism were to be effective, it would have to be the NK cell, which targets altered cells that do not express MHC class | molecules. Neutrophils (choice A) are cells that cause abscess formation against extracellular microbes. They would not be useful against pathogens with intraerythrocytic locations. Tc cells (choice C) are cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize MHC class I on cells infected with intracellular pathogens. They depend on recognition of MHC class I molecules on infected cells, and therefore are unable to recognize erythrocytes, which lack these molecules. TH1 cells (choice D) help promote cell-mediated immune responses that are important in the protection from intracellular pathogens. TH1 cells produce the cytokines that stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, and the cells of antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). TH1 cells are not themselves responsible for clearing intracellular pathogens, however, and the question asks which cell would be able to clear the infection. TH2 cells (choice E) help promote the production of antibodies by B cells. TH2 cells themselves do not clear intracellular infections, although antibodies, complement, opsonization and phagocytosis play an important role in removal of infected erythrocytes from the spleen in malaria."

      "A. Interferon-alpha",
      "B. Interferon-beta",
      "C. Interferon-gamma",
      "D. Interleukin-2",
      "E. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen that lives inside macrophages. The protective immune response to this organism depends on the stimulation of more efficient intracellular killing in phagocytic cells by the cytokines of T helper-1 (TH1) cells. Interferon (IFN)-gamma is a product of TH1 cells that acts on macrophages to enhance their microbicidal activities. IFN-alpha (choice A) is a product of leukocytes that inhibits viral replication. It is unlikely to have an effect on an intracellular bacterial infection. IFN-beta (choice B) is a product of fibroblasts that inhibits viral replication. It is unlikely to have an effect on an intracellular bacterial infection. Interleukin (IL)-2 (choice D) is a product of TH1 cells that causes proliferation (cloning) of other lymphocytes. Because the macrophage is an end cell, incapable of further replication, it would not be affected by IL-2 administration. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (choice E), a product of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, is cytotoxic for tumor cells, induces cytokine production, and causes the cachexia of chronic inflammation. It is unlikely to have a beneficial result on a bacterial infection of macrophages."

    "question": "A 68-year-old man comes to the physician because of fatigue and night sweats. Physical examination shows generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies show: Leukocyte count 13,5300/mm³, Hemaglobin 12.5 g/dL, Hematocrit 38%, Platelet count 120,000/mm³. A peripheral blood smear shows numerous smudge cells. Which of the following marker(s) is/are most likely present on the abnormal cells?",

      "A. CD3",
      "B. CD8",
      "C. CD14",
      "D. CD16 and CD56",
      "E. CD19 and CD20"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This patient most likely has chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which usually occurs in people over 50 years of age. The symptoms (which may or may not be present) and the physical findings are classic for this disorder. The peripheral smear usually shows an increased number of small, round lymphocytes, with occasional 'smudge cells' (fragile cells disrupted in the process of making a smear). The neoplastic cells have an immunophenotype somewhat like B cells, with IgM, or IgM and IgD, on their surfaces. In addition, both the tumor cells and normal B cells have CD19 and CD20 markers that aid in their identification on flow cytometry. In CLL, the tumor cells may additionally have CD5, a T-cell marker present on a small minority of normal B cells. The CD3 (choice A) marker is present on all T cells. The CD8 (choice B) marker is present on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The CD14 (choice C) marker is used to identify macrophages. The CD16 and CD56 (choice D) markers are present on natural killer (NK) cells."

    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a skin rash and epistaxis. A review of his records shows that he has had several severe sinopulmonary infections and that his maternal uncle died of bleeding complications following a cholecystectomy. Which of the following additional findings are most likely to be seen in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. A CD4/CD8 ratio of 1.5:1",
      "B. Cerebellar ataxia",
      "C. Elevated platelet count and high serum IgG. IgA. and IgE levels",
      "D. Low platelet count and low serum IgG levels",
      "E. Low platelet count and low serum IgM levels"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This clinical scenario is typical for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. This is a X-linked recessive disorder presenting with the triad of thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Serum IgM levels are low, IgG levels are nearly normal, and IgA, and IgE levels are increased. Patients have a defective response to polysaccharide antigens, which is due to a cytoskeletal defect in T cells that inhibits their binding to B cells. A CD4/CD8 ratio of 1.5:1 (choice A) is the pattern seen in AIDS due to selective tropism of the CD4+ T-helper cell population. Cerebellar ataxia (choice B) is part of the ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome. The ataxia develops between age 2 and 5 years. The defect is associated with a DNA repair enzyme deficiency. Elevated platelet count and increased serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE (choice C) are not associated with a particular syndrome. Polyclonal gammopathies result in an increase in immunoglobulin of more than one class. This benign alteration is frequently seen in viral or bacterial infections. Thrombocythemia may be associated with a myeloproliferative syndrome or with a secondary reactive process. Low platelet count and low serum IgG (choice D) are not associated with any particular disorder."

    "question": "An 18-year-old man who underwent a tonsilloadenoidectomy 2 days ago is brought to the emergency department because of a high fever, hypotension, and a diffuse desquamating erythematous rash over the palms of his hands. Which of the following TH1-produced cytokines is most likely to be increased in this patient's serum?",
    "options": [
      "A. IFN-gamma",
      "B. IL-1",
      "C. IL-4",
      "D. IL-5",
      "E. TNF-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. This patient is suffering from toxic shock syndrome, which resulted from growth of Staphylococcus aureus in the surgical packing associated with his tonsilloadenoidectomy. S aureus produces an exotoxin, TSST-1, which acts as a superantigen, crosslinking the T-cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens of unrelated T lymphocytes and macrophages (in the absence of antigen recognition), causing their polyclonal stimulation and the production of dangerous amounts of their cytokines. The cytokines that are overproduced during superantigen pathogenesis are interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (from macrophages), and IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma (from TH1 lymphocytes). IL-1 (choice B) is a product of activated macrophages, not TH1 cells, and would be elevated in toxic shock syndrome. This cytokine is also known as endogenous pyrogen and plays a major role in the development of the fever in these cases. IL-4 (choice C) is a product of TH2 lymphocytes that stimulates the differentiation of B lymphocytes in the humoral immune response. It would not be produced in large amounts in superantigen pathogenesis. IL-5 (choice D) is a product of activated macrophages and TH2 lymphocytes and would be elevated in toxic shock syndrome. This cytokine is a second pyrogen and also mediates the acute phase response. TNF-alpha (choice E) is a product of activated macrophages, not TH1 cells, and would be elevated in toxic shock syndrome. This cytokine is pyrogenic and plays a role in cancer cachexia."

    "question": "During an investigational study. a specific antibody to complement component C3b is developed. Intravenous administration of the antibody prevents the biologic effects of C3b. Which of the following immunologic functions is most likely to be inhibited by the administration of this antibody to a patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antibody formation",
      "B. NK cell function",
      "C. Opsonization",
      "D. Tc-cell activation",
      "E. TH-cell activation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. C3b acts as an opsonin, along with IgG, to facilitate phagocytosis. It is also critically involved in the removal of immune complexes from the blood. Phagocytes have Fc receptors (CD16), which allow them to clear immune complexes from the serum, and immune complexes also activate the complement cascade. C3b is generated in excess during the activation of the classical complement cascade. Antibody formation (choice A) would not be affected by an antibody to C3b. Antibodies are formed by B cells in the bone marrow and secreted by plasma cells in the periphery. C3b has nothing to do with this process. Natural killer (NK) cell function (choice B) is increased by TH1 cytokines, but would not be affected by C3b. Tc-cell activation (choice D) occurs via stimulation with TH1 cytokines, but not C3b. TH-cell activation (choice E) occurs via macrophage presentation of MHC class II molecules loaded with foreign peptides, followed by stimulation with interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It is not altered by C3b."

A protein injected into the skin of the forearm shows a 15-mm indurated swelling 48 hours later. Which of the following immune effector mechanisms has most likely occurred?",
    "options": [
      "A. An Arthus reaction",
      "B. Mast cell degranulation",
      "C. Neutrophil diapedesis",
      "D. TH1 cells have attracted macrophages",
      "E. TH2 cells have activated B cells"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. The tuberculin skin test is a delayed-type hypersensitivity test. This type IV hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response involving CD4 T helper-1 (TH1) lymphocytes activating and attracting macrophages into the area. The most important cytokine stimulating this response is interferon-gamma, produced by TH1 cells to activate macrophages. This individual is tuberculin test-positive, and should now have cultures and a chest x-ray to confirm an active case of TB. An Arthus reaction (choice A) has not occurred. The Arthus reaction is an example of a type III (immune complex) hypersensitivity involving antibody, antigen, and complement activation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen, and therefore requires cell-mediated, not antibody-mediated, immunity. Mast cell degranulation (choice B) has not occurred. Mast cells are involved in type | hypersensitivities, along with IgE. Antibodies are not involved in the etiology of type IV hypersensitivity. Neutrophil diapedesis (choice C) has not occurred. Although neutrophils are always the first responders to any injury, by 48 hours they would no longer be the predominant cell in this area. It is not the case that TH2 cells have activated B cells (choice E) because TH2 cells and B cells are involved in the production of the humoral immune response, and the tuberculin response is the classic demonstration of the function of the cell-mediated arm of the immune response."

    "question": "A 15-year-old boy who recently immigrated from Africa is brought to the physician by his parents because of a fever and weight loss. Physical examination shows hepatosplenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 35%. and platelets of 125,000/mm³. A peripheral blood smear shows amastigotes in monocytes. Which of the following cytokines is most important in containing this infection?",
    "options": [
      "A. IFN-gamma",
      "B. IL-2",
      "C. IL-4",
      "D. IL-10",
      "E. TNF-alpha"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The finding of amastigotes inside monocytes and macrophages in the circulation, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow suggests a diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that survives inside macrophages. Therefore, the most effective immune response is cell-mediated, with stimulation of macrophage-killing mechanisms. The most important cytokines to stimulate macrophage microbicidal activity are those produced by TH1 cells, especially interferon (IFN)-gamma. Interleukin (IL)-2 (choice B) is a product of TH1 cells that causes the proliferation (cloning) of other lymphocytes. Because the macrophage is an end cell, incapable of further replication, it would not be affected by IL-2 administration. IL-4 (choice C) is a product of TH2 cells that causes the differentiation of B lymphocytes. It acts antagonistically to TH1 cells, which would mediate the protective response needed in this patient. IL-10 (choice D) is a product of TH2 cells that causes the differentiation of B lymphocytes. It inhibits TH1 cells, which would assist in the protective response needed in this patient. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (choice E) is a product of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells that is cytotoxic for tumor cells, induces cytokine production, and causes the cachexia of chronic inflammation. It is unlikely to have a beneficial result on the microbicidal activity of macrophages."

    "question": "A 5-year-old child is brought to a physician for the evaluation of a potential genetic deficiency. The parents say that she has had numerous infections and has failed to make a protective immune response after vaccination with the DTaP or MMR vaccines. Flow cytometry of a blood sample shows normal numbers of CD19+, CD16+, and CD8+ cells but a near-total absence of CD4+ cells. Which of the following molecules is most likely absent from this patient's cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gamma-delta T-cell receptor",
      "B. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1",
      "C. Killer inhibitory receptor",
      "D. MHC class |",
      "E. MHC class Il"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. This child has major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deficiency, which causes a defect in the development of CD4+ cells in the thymus. Because there is no MHC class II, helper cells cannot be selected. However, cytotoxic cells (CD8+), which recognize MHC class | molecules, are normally produced. This condition is also known as type II bare lymphocyte syndrome, and because helper T cells are required for virtually all immune responses, it will affect the patient's ability to respond to both extra- and intracellular pathogens. The gamma-delta T-cell receptor (choice A) is present on a small proportion of T cells that do not undergo thymic selection. Their function in the body is not known, but they would not be affected by the absence of the class II MHC. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (choice B), found on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the body, reacts with LFA-1 on T cells for the purpose of cell-to-cell adhesion. Its absence would not affect the development of cells in the thymus. The killer inhibitory receptor (choice C) is one of two receptors found on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. It inhibits the killing of an attached cell if it is bound to MHC class |. Because this child has normal levels of CD16+ (NK) cells, it is unlikely she has a deficiency of this receptor. MHC class | (choice D) is the molecule that presents peptides that have been produced intracellularly to CD8+ cytotoxic cells. If this molecule had been absent, the patient would have exhibited susceptibility to intracellular pathogens, and not both intra- and extracellular pathogens as described in this case."

    "question": "A 7-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a yeast infection of the diaper area that does not respond fo therapy. A review of his records shows that he has had multiple acute pyogenic infections. A leukocyte differential count shows: 70 neutrophils. 20 lymphocytes. and 10 monocytes. Circulating lymphocytes are all CD-19 positive. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenosine deaminase deficiency",
      "B. Defective CD40L molecule",
      "C. Defective IL-2 receptor",
      "D. Inability to produce MHC-II molecules",
      "E. Nonsense mutation of rag genes"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is associated with deficiencies in both B and T cells due to a defect in differentiation of an early stem cell. Over 50% of cases are caused by a gene defect on the X chromosome, resulting in a defective gamma-chain of receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-11, IL-15 and IL-21. Because of defective signaling from the IL-7 receptor, there is profound decrease in T cell numbers. B cell numbers may be near normal, but antibody synthesis is impaired in the absence of T helper cells. NK cell activity may also be diminished because of the absence of the IL-15 receptor. Adenosine deaminase deficiency (choice A) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a deficiency of adenosine deaminase, which results in accumulation of metabolites that are toxic to both B and T stem cells in the bone marrow. Children with severe infections usually die within the first 2 years of life unless they receive bone marrow transplants. This deficiency produces a SCID, but it is much more rare than deficiencies of IL-2 receptors. A defective CD40L molecule (choice B) causes hyper-IgM syndrome. This makes it impossible for B lymphocytes to receive the signal to switch isotypes, and they are therefore 'stuck' making IgM alone. It is not classified as a SCID. Inability to produce major histocompatibility complex (MHC)II (choice D) causes bare lymphocyte syndrome, which causes patients to be unable to produce CD4 cells. It results in a type of SCID since T-helper (TH) cells are necessary for the function of all immune responses, but is much less common than SCID due to IL-2 receptor deficiency. Nonsense mutation of rag genes (choice E) results in a SCID, because without the ability to perform VDJ recombinations, lymphocytes cannot express surface receptors for antigen, and in that case, lymphocyte precursors are induced to undergo apoptosis in the bone marrow. Recombination activating genes (rag genes) are responsible for the VDJ rearrangements that allow lymphocytes to create the idiotype of their antigen receptors. These are extremely rare conditions."

    "question": "A 14-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of dyspnea. tachycardia, and diaphoresis following a bee sting. Which of the following is the first immunoglobulin produced in response to this antigen?",
    "options": ["A. lgA", "B. IgD", "C. IgE", "D. IgG", "E. IgM"],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is E. The first immunoglobulin produced in response to any immunogen is always IgM. This is because of the sequential transcription of the DNA coding for the immunoglobulin isotype genes. The first constant domain that is encoded downstream in the DNA from the idiotype coding is that for IgM and then IgD. These two isotypes are produced and expressed concomitantly. It is not possible for any other immunoglobulin to be made first. The symptoms that this patient is having are the result of a type | hypersensitivity reaction, but in these reactions the IgE antibody is preformed and already bound to mast cell receptors. IgE is not made during the hypersensitivity reaction itself. IgA (choice A), IgE (choice C) and IgG (choice D) can only be produced as a secondary response, i.e., one that follows the primary IgM response. The DNA coding for the IgD (choice B) heavy chain follows that of IgM in the lymphocyte germ-line DNA. Mature, naive B lymphocytes express both IgM and IgD on their surfaces because of alternative RNA splicing, but the complete IgM molecule is always produced first."

Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count, and normal immunoglobulin levels. B- and T-cell counts. and complement levels. The nitroblue tetrazolium test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cytoskeletal defect",
      "B. Defect of IL-2 receptor",
      "C. Defect of NADPH oxidase",
      "D. Defect of tyrosine kinase",
      "E. Thymic aplasia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The fact that the boy has had several different infections with pyogenic bacteria requiring antibiotics suggests an inability of phagocytes to kill bacteria. The nitroblue tetrazolium test (NBT) for reactive oxygen intermediates was negative, indicating that the boy suffers from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). CGD is most often due to a defect in NADPH oxidase, which is necessary for leukocyte hydrogen peroxide production. It leads to an inability to kill bacteria and fungi that are catalase-positive. A cytoskeletal defect (choice A) is the underlying lesion in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which causes a triad of symptoms including eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. A defect of IL-2 receptors (choice B) is the most common cause of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). Patients with SCIDs have an inability to mount any immune response, and are therefore susceptible to infections of all types. A patient with SCID would not have the normal immunoglobulin levels and T- and B-cell counts given here. A defect of tyrosine kinase (choice D) is the cause of Bruton agammaglobulinemia. It would cause a blockage of maturation of B lymphocytes, so B-cell numbers in the blood would be depressed and serum immunoglobulin levels would be minimal. These patients are susceptible to extracellular pathogens but have normal abilities to mount delayed-hypersensitivity reactions and responses to intracellular pathogens. Thymic aplasia (choice E) is observed in DiGeorge syndrome as an embryonic failure of formation of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. In such a case, there would be depressed numbers of T cells in the peripheral blood. This is referred to as velocardiofacial syndrome to reflect the fact that such individuals have hypocalcemic tetany (due to malformed parathyroids), malformation of the mouth and face (cleft palate and vertical elongation of the mouth), and cardiac abnormalities (persistent truncus arteriosus)."

      "D. Indirect Coombs test to measure IgM anti-Rh antibody",
      "E. Ouchterlony test to measure precipitating IgG anti-Rh antibody"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The indirect Coombs test is the test of choice to detect the presence of IgG anti-Rh antibody circulating in the mother's blood. Serum is collected from the mother and mixed with Rh-positive red blood cells. If the mother is making the antibody, it will bind to the Rh-positive cells, and when Coombs serum (anti-human IgG) is then added, the erythrocytes will then agglutinate. The direct Coombs test (choice A) is used to diagnose a child at risk for development of hemolytic disease of the newborn. A sample of the child's blood is mixed with Coombs serum (anti-human IgG) and if there is agglutination, it means that the child's erythrocytes have already been coated by maternal anti-Rh antibodies. These antibodies are IgG antibodies that can cross the placenta, and not IgM antibodies (choice B) that would not be able to cause this problem. An indirect Coombs test to measure IgM anti-Rh antibody (choice D) is not available, and would not be useful, since IgM does not cross the placenta and would therefore not cause hemolytic disease of the newborn. An assay for the presence of IgM against erythrocyte antigens would be an agglutination reaction, and not a Coombs test, which requires finding antibodies that have already coated erythrocytes. The Ouchterlony test (choice E), or double-diffusion reaction, is basically used to determine if two antigens are identical, non-identical, or related. It is not the direct Coombs test for hemolytic disease of the newborn (the object is to find the presence of maternal antibodies, not antigens, on the child or in the mother)."

      "D. c-ANCA",
      "E. p-ANCA"

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. This patient has Wegener granulomatosis, which is characterized by renal involvement, severe upper respiratory tract symptoms, and pulmonary involvement. Other organ systems may also be involved. The renal syndrome is a crescentic, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis leading to renal failure. The upper respiratory tract findings include sinus pain and drainage, and purulent or bloody nasal discharge with or without nasal ulcerations. Nasal septal perforation may follow. Pulmonary involvement may be clinically silent, with only infiltrates present on x-ray, or it may present as cough and hemoptysis. ANCA stands for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and c-ANCA refers to antibody that localizes staining to the cytoplasm of neutrophils. The most common target antigen is proteinase 3 (PR-3). c-ANCA is a marker for Wegener granulomatosis, present in a high percentage of patients. Anticentromere antibody (choice A) is associated with approximately 90% of patients who have CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal motility syndrome, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia), which is also called limited systemic sclerosis. Anti-Ro (choice B) is also called anti-SS-A and is associated with Sjogren syndrome (70-95%). Anti-SS-B (choice C) is associated with Sjogren syndrome (60-90%). p-ANCA (choice E) refers to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies that localize in a perinuclear fashion. These are usually directed against myeloperoxidase in the cell. p-ANCA antibodies can sometimes be seen in Wegener granulomatosis, but are more characteristic of Churg-Strauss syndrome, a medium to small vessel vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. It causes eosinophil-rich inflammation involving the respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium to small sized vessels."

      "C. Neutrophils",
      "D. NK cells",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This patient has pneumococcal pneumonia, which must be considered in any patient with chills, fever, chest pain, and cough productive of purulent, rust-colored sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an α-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in short chains. It can easily be distinguished from other α-hemolytic streptococci because it is exquisitely sensitive to bile and bile-like compounds, such as Optochin. It is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis in adults older than 30 years. The only recognized virulence factor of S. pneumoniae is its carbohydrate capsule (which contains acidic polysaccharides). Antibody to a specific capsule type is necessary to overcome infection. More than 80 capsule types have been recognized. The 23 types that most commonly cause disease are contained in a vaccine that is recommended for high-risk groups, including the elderly and those undergoing splenectomy. Increased susceptibility is also found in patients with Hodgkin disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloma. The vaccine should still be given to patients with these conditions, but it is less protective because of diminished patient ability to mount an antibody response. The alternative complement pathway (choice A) is important in clearing Neisseria infections. Individuals with deficiencies in C5 through C8 are at increased risk of disease from Neisseria. Neutrophils (choice C) will be found in the sputum of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, but they do not provide immunity. They are attracted to the area by N-formyl methionine peptides found in the bacteria, but have difficulty engulfing the organism due to the antiphagocytic nature of the capsule. T cells and NK cells (choices D and E) are predominantly used for the clearance of intracellular pathogens, and pneumococcal pneumonia is an extracellular pathogen."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman comes to the physician for a pre-employment physical examination. She says that as a child she experienced two episodes of fever, headache, and sore joints following severe sore throats. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following sequelae of her childhood illness is most likely to develop in this patient as she grows older?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arthritis",
      "B. Fibrinous pericarditis",
      "C. Mitral valve disease",
      "D. Myocarditis",
      "E. Neurologic disease"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. After an initial attack of rheumatic fever, an affected individual is at increased risk for developing recurrent rheumatic disease after each pharyngeal infection by beta-hemolytic streptococci. Any one of the manifestations of rheumatic disease can recur, but will usually resolve. The damage to the heart valves caused by rheumatic fever can lead to fibrous scarring and deformity, producing valvular dysfunction (particularly mitral stenosis) that may lead to heart failure in late adulthood. This is an example of a type II hypersensitivity reaction in which tissue-specific autoantibodies cause damage to host tissues. The inflammatory response associated with type II hypersensitivities is usually localized rather than systemic. The arthritis (choice A) produced by rheumatic fever is transitory and resolves after the attack has run its course. There are no long-term complications of the arthritis. Fibrinous pericarditis (choice B), like almost any fibrinous inflammatory response, is an acute process. Although the patient may develop some scarring of the pericardium, this is generally not sufficient to produce long-lasting consequences. Myocardial involvement (choice D) by rheumatic fever is typically seen as Aschoff bodies, collections of fibrinoid necrosis, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes within the myocardium. When the event resolves, the Aschoff bodies will be replaced by discrete fibrous scars. No appreciable myocardial dysfunction ensues. Sydenham chorea, the neurologic manifestation of rheumatic fever, leaves no lasting neurologic effects (choice E)."

    "question": "A 33-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a deep puncture wound in her right hand. A shard of glass is removed from the patient's hand, and the wound is appropriately cleaned and treated at the time of the accident. Twelve hours later, the wound becomes inflamed and swollen despite appropriate therapy. Which of the following molecules plays an important role in producing chemotaxis of white blood cells into this area?",
    "options": ["A. C3b", "B. C5a", "C. IgM", "D. IL-2", "E. Lysozyme"],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. In active inflammation, the complement system has been activated and C5a is being produced. C5a is a strong chemoattractant to neutrophils and other phagocytic cells. Other chemotactic factors for neutrophils include IL-8, fibrinopeptides, leukotriene B4, and formyl methionyl peptides from bacteria. C3b (choice A) acts as an opsonin for microorganisms. When the organism is coated with C3b, it is more easily phagocytized. C3b is formed via the classical and alternative complement pathways, but it is not chemotactic for neutrophils. IgM (choice C) is the large antibody produced in the primary immune response. It is not chemotactic for neutrophils. IL-2 (choice D) is a growth-promoting interleukin that stimulates the proliferation of natural killer cells, and T-cytotoxic cells, and T-helper lymphocytes, but it is not chemotactic for neutrophils. Lysozyme (choice E) is a natural antibacterial present in tears, mucus, vaginal secretions, and other body fluids. It is active against the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls, splitting the backbone structure of the peptidoglycan (N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid polymers). It is not chemotactic for neutrophils."

    "question": "A 15-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of sore throat, rhinorrhea. fever, and productive cough. A review of his records shows that this is the seventh time over the last 6 months that the child has been brought to the emergency department because of an illness. Prior visits have been because of infections involving the skin, ear, and respiratory tract. Laboratory studies show extremely low levels of serum IgG and an absence of CD19+ cells. Which of the following genes is likely mutated or deficient in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adenosine deaminase",
      "B. Bruton tyrosine kinase",
      "C. CD18",
      "D. CD40L",
      "E. NADPH oxidase"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Bruton x-linked agammaglobulinemia is the only one of the humoral immune deficiencies in which there are no peripheral B cells (no CD19+ cells). The mutation is in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene (Btk) that is required for pre-B cells to develop to immature B cells in the bone marrow. Adenosine deaminase deficiency (choice A) is the deficiency in one form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. CD18 (choice C) is deficient in leukocyte adhesion deficiency, leading to failure of diapedesis, in which leukocytes are unable to extravasate to an area of inflammation due to lack of the common beta chain of integrin molecules. CD40L (choice D) is missing in hyper-IgM syndrome, in which IgM-producing B cells cannot receive the signal to isotype-switch to production of IgA, IgG, and IgE. The actual deficiency is in TH cells that are deficient in expression of CD40L. NADPH oxidase (choice E) is the enzyme that is deficient in chronic granulomatous disease, which will then result in an inability to generate toxic oxygen metabolites inside phagocytic cells. This would cause increased susceptibility to catalase-positive organisms, but would not result in diminished numbers of circulating B lymphocytes or reduced immunoglobulin levels."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of frequent upper respiratory tract infections. His mother says that he was delivered at 39 weeks' gestation and that the pregnancy was uneventful. A review of his records shows that he is up-to-date on all his immunizations. He has had three hospitalizations in the past year for pneumonia. Laboratory studies will most likely show a deficiency of which of the following immunoglobulins in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. A dimeric immunoglobulin",
      "B. A pentameric immunoglobulin",
      "C. An immunoglobulin that binds to mast cells",
      "D. An immunoglobulin that is an antigen receptor on mature naive B lymphocytes",
      "E. An immunoglobulin that mediates antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Selective IgA deficiency (<5 mg/dL) is the most common of all the primary immunodeficiency diseases. The incidence reported in the United States has ranged from 1:250 to 1:1,000. Recurrent bacterial and viral infections of the respiratory tract can be attributed to a lack of secretory IgA (sIgA), the predominant immunoglobulin of the mucosal immune system. IgA is a dimer held together by a single J chain, and a secretory component is added by mucosal cells as it is transported into the lumen of the organ system. Children typically do not begin to develop severe signs of this deficiency until their second year of life because maternally acquired IgG (across the placenta) and IgA (in breast milk) protect the child for the first year of life. A pentameric immunoglobulin (choice B) describes serum IgM. This is the most important immunoglobulin of the primary immune response, but it is not important in protection against mucosal surface pathogens. An immunoglobulin that binds to mast cells (choice C) describes IgE. It is involved in the mediation of type | hypersensitivity responses and anti-parasite responses. An immunoglobulin that is an antigen receptor on mature naive B lymphocytes (choice D) describes IgD. Its only known function is as an antigen receptor on the surface of mature naive B lymphocytes. An immunoglobulin that mediates antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (choice E) describes IgG. The binding of the Fc region of IgG molecules to natural killer cells, neutrophils, and macrophages can cause destruction of cells targeted by the antibody."

    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of fever of recent onset and pain and swelling of his knees and ankles. He had an upper respiratory infection 2 weeks ago, for which he received acetaminophen. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 22/min. and blood pressure is 115/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows erythematous skin macules with a clear center, arthritis, and small subcutaneous nodules on the dorsal aspect of the arms. A systolic murmur in the mid-precordial area is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following is the most likely immunopathogenetic mechanism responsible for this condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Type | hypersensitivity",
      "B. Type Il hypersensitivity",
      "C. Type lll hypersensitivity",
      "D. Type IV hypersensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The clinical manifestations fulfill the diagnostic criteria for rheumatic disease, a condition characterized by pancarditis (endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis), arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, chorea, and erythema marginatum. A history of pharyngitis, otitis, or other streptococcal infections preceding the onset of the disease by 2-3 weeks is usually elicited. The triggering etiologic agent is group A Streptococcus, which incites production of antistreptococcal antibodies that cross-react with antigens of heart, skin, and nervous tissues. The antibodies bind fixed antigens and trigger an acute inflammatory response that eventually resolves with permanent scarring. This type of hypersensitivity response, in which autoantibodies bind antigens on cells or tissues, is classified as type II. Other examples of type II hypersensitivity-mediated diseases include Graves disease (the autoantibodies stimulate hormone production by binding thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] receptors) and myasthenia gravis (the autoantibodies interfere with cholinergic neuromuscular transmission by binding nicotinic receptors). Type | hypersensitivity (choice A) is mediated by IgE. Antigens bind IgE on the surface of mast cells and trigger the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine and heparin, and then activation of the arachidonic acid cascade causes production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Asthma and urticaria are classic examples of this immune mechanism. Type III hypersensitivity (choice C) is mediated by soluble immune complexes, i.e., antigen-antibody complexes. Diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and various types of vasculitis are due to this mechanism. Type IV hypersensitivity (choice D) is mediated by T lymphocytes and often results in formation of granulomas. Granulomatous inflammation caused by Mycobacteria is an example of a type IV cell-mediated reaction."

    "question": "A 47-year-old man with a history of polycystic kidney disease is awaiting a renal transplant. A living donor is found who matches the patient at A, B, and DR loci. Which of the following best describes this type of transplant?",
    "options": [
      "A. Allogeneic graft",
      "B. Autograft",
      "C. Isograft",
      "D. Syngeneic graft",
      "E. xenograft"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. A transplant between two members of the same species who are not genetically identical is an allogeneic graft. This is the most commonly performed graft in today's medicine. An autograft (choice B) is a graft from one location to another on the same individual. This is the only type of graft that will not experience rejection, even without immunosuppressive drugs. This type of transplantation is performed in coronary bypass surgery and in skin grafting following burns. Isografts and syngeneic grafts (choices C and D) are grafts between monozygotic twins. Typically, this procedure in the human is called an isograft; in other species it is called a syngeneic graft. Even monozygotic twins have genetic distinctions that arise during gestation and development, so some level of immunosuppression is still required following this form of engraftment. A xenograft (choice E) is a transplant between members of different species. Pig heart valves are often used in humans in this way."
