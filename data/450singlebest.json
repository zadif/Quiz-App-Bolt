    "question": "A nervous 42-year-old woman presents herself to your antenatal clinic very worried that she has missed the right time to have her combined test for Down’s syndrome screening. She is now 17 weeks pregnant and is very concerned about her age. You counsel her about the appropriate alternative, the quadruple test and arrange to have this done. What assays make up the quadruple test?",
    "options": [
      "A. AFP, PAPP-A, inhibin B and beta hCG",
      "B. Unconjugated oestradiol, hCG, AFP and inhibin A",

    "explanation": "Down’s syndrome screening is offered to all pregnant women in the UK. She is 42 which gives you an age-related risk of one in 55 of having a child with Down’s syndrome. Early in the second trimester the combined test is offered. This includes an ultrasound scan of the fetal neck looking at the nuchal translucency (NT) and two blood tests – PAPP-A and beta hCG. This can be reliably performed from 10 to 13 weeks. Ideally, an integrated test using the combined test and the quadruple test can be used to create a Down’s risk. As she has missed the chance to have an NT, she would only be offered the quadruple test, which is unconjugated oestradiol, total hCG, AFP and inhibin A – Answer (B). The downside of the quadruple test is that it has a 4.4 per cent false-positive rate compared with 2.2 per cent for the combined test and only 1 per cent for the integrated test. In the event of a high risk result, this woman would be offered an amniocentesis to exclude Down’s syndrome and other chromosome abnormalities.",

    "explanation": "This is difficult to answer as it depends on how aggressive the cancer is. There may be a need for delivery but it would not be immediate as she is only 29 weeks pregnant. You would give a course of betamethasone in order to promote fetal lung maturity prior to delivery. Tamoxifen (A) is not safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding because of the high risk of teratogenicity. Radiotherapy (C) is contraindicated in pregnancy unless it is as a life-saving option. All chemotherapy is potentially teratogenic in the first trimester but may used in the mid- and third trimesters. Ideally birth should be 2–3 weeks after the most recent chemotherapy session to allow bone marrow regeneration. Bone isotope scans (E) and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (B) are likely to provide insufficient clinical value to warrant the high dose of radiation that the fetus would be exposed to.",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": null,
    "topic": "High risk antenatal care",
    "explanation": "Obesity is an increasing problem for healthcare providers. The number of women falling pregnant who have a BMI >30 kg/m2 (obese) is increasing year on year. The rate of increase of morbidly obese and super morbidly obese women falling pregnant is dramatic. The Confidential Enquiries into maternal deaths informs us that a disproportionate number of mothers who die are obese. Ideally, pre-conception advice is key for these women; this should include weight loss and high-dose (5 mg) folic acid supplementation. This woman is already diabetic but those who are not need to be screened for diabetes. Venous thromboembolism risk is high in pregnancy anyway due to the increased coagulability of the maternal blood. That risk increases massively in women who are morbidly obese (A) so all obese women should be offered mechanical and pharmaceutical thromboprophylaxis. Vitamin D 10 mg once a day is recommended for all women with a BMI >30, not vitamin C. Obese patients pose particular difficulties to the anaesthetist and the risks of failed regional anaesthesia and intubation, should a general anaesthetic be necessary, are much higher than for women of normal BMI: it is wise to offer obese women an antenatal anaesthetic review (D). Obese women have a higher risk of post-partum haemorrhage, so an actively managed third stage (the use of syntometrine and controlled cord traction at delivery) is routine (E).",

Risk factors include high BMI, previous macrosomic baby, previous history of GDM, family history of diabetes and ethnicity. Routine antenatal screening in Britain follows NICE and WHO guidance. Those women at risk of GDM should be tested using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), where the fasted woman is given a 75 g oral load of glucose and has a venous plasma glucose level tested at 2 hours. The WHO definition of gestational diabetes encompasses both impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose greater than or equal to 7.8 μmol/L (B)) and diabetes (random glucose greater than or equal to 7.0 μmol/L or 2-hour glucose greater than or equal to 7.8 μmol/L).

Cytomegalovirus (D) is a DNA virus that usually leads to asymptomatic infection. Transmission to the fetus leading to damage occurs in about 10 per cent of cases. Forty to 50 per cent of all women of childbearing age have not had cytomegalovirus infection so it is not cost effective to screen everyone. Toxoplasmosis is contracted from such things as undercooked/cured meat and cat faeces. It is not routinely tested for in pregnancy as the low risk of toxoplasmosis (A) becoming a florid infection rather than an indolent disease in a non-immunocompromised infection makes it not worthwhile. It is not cost effective to test for hepatitis C (B).",

Abnormalities of placentation are detected and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is organized by the fetal medicine consultant.

    "explanation": "Placenta praevia (D), where the placenta attaches to the uterine wall close to or overlying the cervical opening, afflicts one in 200 pregnancies. Placenta accreta (A) is firm adhesion of the placenta to the uterine wall without extending through the full myometrium, as occurs in placenta increta (C). If the placenta invades the full thickness of the myometrium and beyond it, it is called placenta percreta (B). Risk factors for placenta accreta (and increta and percreta) include the presence of uterine scar tissue, which may be seen in Asherman’s syndrome after uterine cavity surgery, for example dilatation and curettage. It is postulated that a thin decidua – the uterine cavity lining in pregnancy which is formed under the influence of progesterone – can encourage abnormal placentation. Although the case in this question may represent one example of placenta praevia owing to the placenta’s proximity to the cervical opening, it is more likely to be an example of placenta percreta here, given the invasion of the bladder. Ectopic pregnancy (E) may rarely carry to late pregnancy, leading to trophic invasion of the bladder, but in such cases an extrauterine pregnancy would be clearly demonstrated on ultrasound scanning.",

    "explanation": "Bleeding in pregnancy is a very common complaint. It can range from trivial to life threatening. The two main things to rule out are a placental abruption and placenta praevia. We know that this woman at 20 weeks had a placenta praevia. Abruptions tend to lead to painful bleeding. Small bleeds can precede very big bleeds so this woman should be admitted to hospital for observation and an ultrasound arranged the next day for placental localization. Therefore, (A) and (E) are incorrect. There is debate whether steroids should be given for small antepartum bleeds in a haemodynamically stable woman. In this case, it would be reasonable to wait to see if the bleeding returns before instigating a course of steroids, so (B) is not the most appropriate management. If the bleeding ceases and the woman otherwise remains well, there is no need to keep her in hospital for 48 hours (C) with the attendant risks (risk of hospital-acquired infections and venous thromboembolism associated with immobility).",

    "answer": "D",
    "page": 7,
    "topic": "Rupture of membranes",
    "explanation": "This is a very traumatic and frightening experience for any woman. Her large cervical cone biopsy is a risk factor for second trimester miscarriage. The outlook for this pregnancy is very poor if rupture of membranes is confirmed: most pregnancies at this gestation are lost if the membranes rupture. However, it would be inappropriate to offer termination (B) at this stage until there was definitive evidence of ruptured membranes, or if the mother requested it. This woman needs to be admitted to hospital for observation. She needs investigating to rule out infection – ensuring there is no leukocytosis, rising C-reactive protein or growth on a mid-stream urinary culture – along with regular observations. The main concern is that she is at risk of developing sepsis from the prolonged rupture of membranes. Owing to the risk to the mother of ascending infection, chorioamnionitis and thus generalized sepsis, this woman should not be discharged so options (A) and (E) are incorrect. It may well be that this woman will become septic and in order to save her life she will need to be induced, but while she remains well this is not the first step. She is <24 weeks gestation so she should not be given steroids (C) for fetal lung maturity. An ultrasound will help add weight to your clinical diagnosis if no liquor is seen but ultrasound alone is not diagnostic. Very occasionally women with preterm rupture do not become septic or spontaneously miscarry. If she gets to 24 weeks there may be a case for steroids although there may well be additional factors for lung hypoplasia with the fetus having developed in an environment without much liquor.",

Venous thromboembolism remains one of the largest causes of maternal mortality in the developed world, and preventing it remains a focus of modern obstetric practice. Imaging in pregnancy aims to deliver the highest diagnostic value for the lowest dose of ionizing radiation. Ultrasound (E) has little value in the investigation of pulmonary embolism and MRI scanning is unhelpful in showing the vascular abnormalities present in pulmonary embolism. D-Dimer (C) is normally raised after the first trimester of pregnancy, and in any case is only of predictive value and not diagnostic importance. This patient requires urgent definitive diagnosis, and only CTPA (A) or ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) (D) scanning will suffice. Of these, a V/Q scan exposes the patient to by far the lowest radiation dose, and is thus the preferred investigation in pregnant women.",

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 7,
    "topic": "Antenatal haemorrhage",
    "explanation": "The gush of fluid followed by a steady trickle suggests ruptured membranes. At 36 weeks gestation she is technically preterm, and this combined with an absence of contractions indicates PPROM. This woman also has a placenta praevia, which indicates that the placenta is low-lying. As soon as the candidate realises this, it is clear that a vaginal delivery is not possible. Therefore, options (A) and (B) are immediately incorrect as these management options aim for an end-result of vaginal delivery. Digital assessment of a patient with antepartum haemorrhage is contraindicated (C) unless a diagnosis of preterm labour has been made; this is to reduce the risk of infection. We are therefore left with either caesarean delivery or managing conservatively as PPROM (D). Management of PPROM involves the use of a 10-day course of antibiotic prophylaxis against chorioamnionitis, steroids to aid fetal lung maturation before the 34th week, and expectant management until 34 weeks gestation. The RCOG recommends that a patient with PPROM should be delivered between 34 and 36 weeks gestation. This woman’s pregnancy is in its 36th week and so delivery should be expedited. With a placenta praevia, the only feasible mode of delivery is caesarean section (E).",

You must explore all long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARC) with her, these being the Mirena coil, copper coil (T380) implanon and depoprovera IM injections. If she is sure that hormones (A, D) have a bad effect on her then the copper coil would be appropriate for her. This would leave her with the chance to have further children if she changes her mind or there is an unforeseen change in her circumstances. A vasectomy (E) is a very successful contraceptive method but it is a decision her partner would need to be here to discuss and to make, so in these circumstances it is not the most appropriate option.

    "explanation": "This question tests the candidate’s ability to distinguish physiological sequelae of normal pregnancy from more worrying features. In pregnancy, a soft systolic flow murmur is frequently audible on auscultation of the praecordium due to dilatation across the tricuspid valve causing mild regurgitant flow. Such a flow murmur is physiological and will disappear after delivery. Furthermore, the increasing size of the gravid uterus displaces the heart upwards and to the left. Mild abdominal pains and fatigue are common, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. The woman in this case is experiencing normal pregnancy, and no specific treatment is necessary (B). Induction is not indicated in normal pregnancy at this gestation (E). Preterm induction of labour is offered to women for whom the maternal and fetal risks of continuing pregnancy outweigh the benefits associated with delivery at a later gestation (e.g. fetal maturation). Investigating physiological murmurs which pose no maternal or fetal risk may cause the mother unnecessary alarm (A, C, D). Maternal echocardiography (A) may be relevant if there was suspicion of structural heart disease (e.g. cardiomyopathy) or valvular disease (e.g. aortic steonsis in order to assess the patient’s capacity to cope with the stress on the heart during labour, and in particular the second stage of labour.",

    "explanation": "Although knowledge of managing HIV positive pregnant women is beyond the scope of most undergraduate curricula, in this question the presence of HIV infection is largely a distractor. Delivery of HIV positive women aims to lower the risk of vertical transmission and reduce morbidity. Washing the baby shortly after delivery is a part of that strategy. Induction of labour (B) is not indicated unless there is a benefit to expediting delivery, which in the vignette above there is not. Interventions which increase the risk of maternal/fetal blood transfusion (and therefore vertical transmission), such as amniocentesis, fetal blood sampling or forceps delivery, are avoided in HIV positive women so (C) is incorrect. Giving neonates steroids (D) is not warranted here for any reason. (A) and (E) could both be correct if the woman had a cephalic singleton delivery. However, this woman is at term, not in established labour and has a breech singleton pregnancy. Following publication of the planned vaginal versus caesarean delivery trial in 2000, which demonstrated improved fetal outcomes with caesarean delivery, most centres now exclusively offer elective caesarean section for these mothers. Hence, even if the woman was not HIV pregnancy, (E) would remain the single best answer.",

    "topic": "Complications of pregnancy (4)",
    "explanation": "This woman requires treatment for pulmonary embolism. She is in the third trimester of pregnancy, which is when wafarin is contraindicated (A, B, C). Warfarin is a teratogen, although its use has different effects depending on the gestation of the fetus. Use in the first trimester confers the most risk of teratogenicity, and is associated with fetal warfarin syndrome, a constellation of symptoms comprising nasal hypoplasia, vertebral calcinosis and brachydactyly. The risk of teratogenicity with warfarin use in the mid- and third trimesters is reduced but evidence exists to show a chance of cerebral malformations and ophthalmic disorders. Although both enoxaparin (Clexane) (D) and fondaparinux (Arixtra) (E) are both indicated in the treatment of pulmonary embolism, evidence of efficacy and safety in pregnancy only exists for enoxaparin: this is the agent used in the UK for the treatment of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. Recognizing and treating pulmonary embolism in pregnancy is particularly important since it is one of the largest killers of mothers, as reported in the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health.",

    "answer": "D",

    "topic": "Antepartum haemorrhage",
    "explanation": "This woman gives a worrying history of painful vaginal bleeding. Vasa praevia (A) is rare and occurs at the time of rupture of membranes, presenting as a painless bleed associated with sudden fetal compromise and not infrequently intrauterine demise. Placenta praevia (B) characteristically presents as a painless bleed. In this case we know the placenta is not low so this is not the answer. Placenta accreta (C) is a diagnosis of an adherent placenta which may be made on attempting to deliver the placenta post-partum. Placenta accreta is commonly associated with a previous caesarean section scar but can be present in an unscarred uterus. Intercourse can lead to vaginal bleeding as a result of contact with the cervix. A cervical ectropion (E), which is common in pregnancy, is a cause of vaginal bleeding but would not lead to abdominal pains. This woman is most likely having a placental abruption (D) – a separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus. Risk factors include a previous abruption, smoking, a growth restricted baby and hypertension. Classically, the presentation is of a painful vaginal bleed. Abruptions can be life threatening to both mother and child.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 10,
    "topic": "Rhesus isoimmunization",
    "explanation": "The basis of this question is rhesus isoimmunization. If a rhesus negative mother is carrying a rhesus positive baby and then has a feto-maternal transfer of blood, the mother’s immune system will respond to the fetal cells (sensitization). The mother will create anti-D antibodies. The problem arises in any subsequent pregnancy if she has a rhesus positive fetus. The anti-D antibodies will cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells causing a haemolytic anaemia. (A) is wrong as it has no effect on this pregnancy. There is no need to have anti-D before 12 weeks gestation (B). Theoretically, if the woman’s partner is rhesus negative their child will be rhesus negative (D). However, with possibly one in 10 partners not being the real father it would be prudent to advise all women to have the anti-D (avoiding accusing them of infidelity). National guidance now is to have one injection of 1500 IU at 28 weeks gestation but if there are sensitizing events such as vaginal bleeding, abdominal trauma or an external cephalic version the mother will need further doses (E). By elimination, (C) is therefore the best option.",

Answers (A) and (D) provide the most logical course of management, the only difference being that, in (D), that you are anticipating the very real prospect of this woman needing a blood transfusion and delivery. She should be admitted to your high risk area (i.e. labour ward). Initial assessment should involve a cardiovascular review, IV access, full blood count and cross-match for 4 units of blood. Continuous CTG should be in place and antenatal steroids should be commenced as while the patient bleeds the fetuses are at risk. If delivery is imminent, the steroids will not have enough time to affect fetal lung maturity. It is imperative that you involve the consultant obstetrician, anaesthetist, paediatricians and senior midwife as early as possible.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 10,
    "topic": "Seizures in pregnancy",
    "explanation": "Your first suspicion should be that this woman is having an eclamptic fit. This is a potentially life-threatening situation. You will need help as soon as possible. Calling for help, lying the woman flat and tilting her onto her left are the first steps; therefore (C) and (D) are the best answers in an obstetric emergency. You need to protect her airway but insertion of an additional airway (A) in an actively fitting woman would be difficult and potentially dangerous. Also, obtaining IV access while someone is fitting is not safe. Option (B) may well be what happens but in the first instance you need to stabilize the mother and not be preparing to operate yourself. The airway, breathing, circulation approach is a sensible reliable method of leading through this emergency. Tilting onto the left will relieve any aortocaval compression and stop the woman choking if she vomits. The mother must be your primary concern so until the seizure has stopped and the cause of her seizure – likely a raised blood pressure – is controlled, it is prudent not to try and monitor the fetus. This is why answer (C) is not the best course of action as the mother should have her BP checked before checking the fetal heart. This is because even if there is evidence of fetal distress it is not possible to deliver the fetus until the mother is stable. Magnesium sulphate is used as a cerebral membrane stabilizer and should be given as soon as possible. Once the seizure has finished you will need to re-check her airway, breathing and circulation and then monitor the fetus. Option (E) is in fact a good answer but it is important not to forget to put a pregnant woman into a tilt with a wedge or a pillow, even when fitting. Answer (D) is the most appropriate answer.",

If she labours within 6 weeks (not 8 weeks) of developing primary herpes she should consider a caesarean (B). If she refuses to have a caesarean then IV aciclovir during labour and close liaison with the neonatologist is recommended. Neonatal herpes is rare at one in 60 000 but can lead to encephalitis, hepatitis and disseminated skin lesions.

There is no way of predicting stillbirth (B). Preterm labour is more likely as well as meconium stained liquor in labour (E). UDCA is unlicensed but has been used for a long time and has no apparent side effects.

The concern here is that, although the symptoms could fit with a migraine, you need to consider other diagnoses. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (D) has a very sudden onset. In addition to the presenting symptoms there is often papilloedema and focal neurology. The negative CT result does not completely exclude SAH. A lumbar puncture would help diagnosis, looking for blood, bilirubin or xanthochromia in the cerebrospinal fluid. A CVT (C) classically presents post-partum. It has similar symptoms but up to two-thirds will have neurological deficit. MRI is generally a better imaging modality but is often not available out of hours. IIH (E) characteristically occurs in young obese women. It is a headache associated with papilloedema and raised intracranial pressure without CT or MRI evidence of hydrocephalus or a space occupying lesion.

    "explanation": "Mothers who have not had chicken pox are at risk of developing the disease in pregnancy. Pregnant women tend to be affected much worse if they contract chicken pox. Also, if chicken pox is contracted before 28 weeks gestation there is the risk of fetal varicella syndrome (eye defects, hypoplasia of limbs and neurological defects). This woman has had a significant contact with chicken pox and the fact that her child has been with the infected child means that he may well now be about to develop chicken pox. Waiting is simply not a sensible option (A) as she is at risk of developing chicken pox herself and potentially developing fetal varicella syndrome. Although the mother thinks that she has never had chicken pox she may have had a previous subclinical or unknown childhood infection, so if she has antibodies no further action is necessary. Aciclovir can be used to treat chicken pox within 24 hours of the rash appearing so does not need to be started straight away (C). The appropriate management here is for VZIG to be administered (on consultation with the blood products laboratory as it may be in short supply) (D) if her antibody screen is negative. This situation will make mothers very anxious and they will want VZIG straight away, which is not appropriate as her antibodies will not be back yet (B).

Answer (E) is only a relative contraindication along with pre-eclampsia, a scarred uterus and oligohydramnios. At term, 3–4 per cent of all babies are breech. The success of ECV is dependent on case selection and operator experience. The success ranges from 30 to 80 per cent. If the baby turns cephalic there is a 95 per cent chance that it will stay there. In multiple pregnancy (A) ECV is contraindicated due to the risk of abruption and the fact that there is little or no room to turn the fetus. A major uterine abnormality (B) such as bicornuate uterus is a cause of breech presentation. The pregnancy has usually implanted in one of the horns of the uterus and there is no space to turn. You will not be able to turn the baby and may use excessive force. If there has been an antepartum haemorrhage (C) you should not be putting pressure on the uterus as this may increase the chance of an abruption. When the membranes have ruptured (D) the fetus is unlikely to turn as there is less space as the liquor has been drained.",

    "question": "A 24-year-old type 1 diabetic woman has just had her first baby delivered by caesarean section at 35 weeks due to fetal macrosomia and poor blood sugar control. The operation is straightforward with no complications. She has an insulin sliding scale running when you review her on the ward 12 hours postoperatively. She has begun to eat and drink. How would you manage her insulin requirements?",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 13,
    "topic": "Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy (1)",
    "explanation": "Once she is eating and drinking, which will usually be about 6 hours after the operation, she can have the sliding scale taken down. She can now be put back on her pre-pregnancy doses of insulin. Naturally you will need to monitor her blood sugars to ensure that this is adequate insulin replacement. Stopping the insulin (D) all together is not correct as she is a type 1 diabetic who needs exogenous insulin. Continuing the sliding scale for 24 (A) or even 48 (E) hours is unnecessary if the patient is eating. It subjects them to frequent finger prick testing, including at night when they are trying to sleep. Halving her pre-pregnancy dose of insulin (C) is likely to give her less than she requires and provoke hyperglycaemia.",

    "explanation": "This woman is at risk of developing hypertension in her pregnancy. She is 42, in her first pregnancy and has had IVF. Blood pressure in pregnancy normally falls with its lowest point reached between 22 and 24 weeks. Blood pressure then starts to rise for the rest of the pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia (A) is diagnosed with a raised blood pressure and proteinuria. A common cut off for normal urinary protein levels is a PCR of <30. It is always possible to diagnose her with white coat hypertension (B) but this is potentially a very dangerous label to give someone unless all other causes have been excluded. There is no evidence to diagnose Conn’s syndrome (D) from the information given. Conn’s syndrome arises when there is excess aldosterone production from the adrenal glands. This leads to hypertension and often lethargy and muscle fatigue as hypokalaemia can develop. This occurs due to the effect of excess aldosterone on the renal system leading to a potassium losing state. It is quite likely that this woman had a high essential blood pressure (C) at the beginning of pregnancy as it has risen so early in the pregnancy but we do not have that information. Importantly for this woman the risk of develops pregnancy-induced is around 40 per cent if she develops pregnancy- induced hypertension (E) under 30 weeks’ gestation – she will need close monitoring throughout her pregnancy.",

NICE recommends delivery after 38 weeks unless glycaemic control is very poor in order to reduce the risk of stillbirth (B). As soon as the cord is clamped the hyperglycaemic environment that the fetus has lived in for 9 months disappears so hypoglycaemia is a risk (C).

Her CD4 count is low (below 200/mm3) and she is at risk of developing an AIDS defining illnesses. In addition her viral load is high (over 50 copies/mL). If a mother needs HAART she should start it and continue throughout her pregnancy and into the puerperium. If she does not need HAART to treat her HIV then she should start antiretroviral treatment between 20 and 28 weeks in order to prevent vertical transmission. If her viral load is less than 50 copies/mL she may choose to have a normal delivery (A and D). Ideally, prolonged rupture of membranes and artificial rupture of membranes should be avoided. For this reason induction of labour is not appropriate (B and E).

    "topic": "Early pregnancy loss",
    "explanation": "The terms abortion and miscarriage have historically been used interchangeably in gynaecology, which is as confusing to students as it is to patients. Most clinicians use miscarriage to mean a spontaneous fetal loss before 24 weeks’ gestation and termination of pregnancy to use what the layman may call an ‘abortion’ – that is a deliberate termination of the pregnancy. Threatened abortion (A) refers to any vaginal bleeding before viability (traditionally 24 weeks, though this is decreasing) whereas after this point vaginal bleeding is referred to as antepartum haemorrhage. Missed miscarriage (B) is loss of the pregnancy without the passage of products of conception or bleeding. Often erroneously referred to in the media as a miscarriage ‘that you didn’t know happened’, many women in fact experience the fetal loss as the sudden decline of pregnancy-related symptoms: early morning nausea, breast tenderness and vomiting. Septic abortion (B) refers to the loss of an early pregnancy complicated by infection of a retained conceptus. It is a serious complication of termination or miscarriage and must be managed actively: around the world, many women still die from this treatable condition. Incomplete miscarriage (E) is the loss of an early pregnancy with bleeding and/or passage of some but not all products of conception. It can be managed conservatively, medically (with misoprostol to expedite expulsion of the products) or surgically (with suction evacuation of the uterus). Complete abortion (D) refers to loss of the pregnancy where all products of conception have been expelled from the uterus.",

The ketonuria and triplet pregnancy are clues to this diagnosis as multiple fetuses are associated with hyperemesis. Mild lower abdominal and back pains are common at this stage in the pregnancy when the uterus grows out of the pelvis and stretches attached ligaments, and are usually of no consequence. The management of HG involves restoring fluid volume and preventing further nausea and vomiting (D). Diarrhoea and/or signs of sepsis might point in the direction of a gastroenteritis (C) or appendicitis (E). The latter would normally present with a more pronounced pain and less significant vomiting.

There is no fetal pole and no fetal pulsation so we cannot say that this is viable (A). Although by 6 weeks we should see a fetal pole and a fetal heart, it may be that her dates are indeed wrong and that she is less pregnant than assumed. A blighted ovum (C) and an anembryonic pregnancy are the same thing, showing a gestational sac with no developing embryonic pole or yolk sac development. As there is a yolk sac this is unlikely. In view of uncertainties relating to status of pregnancy, it is imperative that people with suspected anembryonic pregnancies (E) have two scans 10–14 days apart to increase certainty that there is no embryo development. A pseudosac (B) is seen in 10–20 per cent of ectopic pregnancies. It is a decidual reaction rather than an embryonic sac – hence there would be no yolk sac.

A pseudosac represents decidualized reactive tissue. Although she is only 5 weeks pregnant, with this scan result you are committed to ruling out an ectopic pregnancy. If the woman is well, is haemodynamically stable and understands what the symptoms are, that should prompt her immediate hospital attendance, then she can be managed as an outpatient. If this is not the case she should be referred to hospital. This woman needs a beta hCG and ideally a progesterone level, with a repeat beta hCG 48 hours afterwards. If there is more than a 67 per cent rise in beta hCG it is likely that the sac seen on the scan is that of a normal viable intrauterine pregnancy. If this is the case she will need an ultrasound in 10 days to confirm the diagnosis and then her TOP can be arranged if she still does not wish to continue her pregnancy. If there is a suboptimal rise in beta hCG she should be seen at hospital for further assessment. Surgical terminations should be performed after 7 weeks while medical terminations can be performed up to 9 weeks.

    "explanation": "Risk factors for ectopic pregnancies include a previous ectopic pregnancy, previous tubal surgery, intrauterine use, pelvic infection and in vitro fertilization. The main concern with an ectopic is that as it grows it may rupture and lead to intra-abdominal bleeding, acute collapse and occasionally death. We know that some people will undergo a tubal miscarriage and avoid rupture. A laparoscopic salpingectomy (A) would be a definitive procedure but would leave a young girl with only one fallopian tube. However, this may not significantly after her fertility as it may be that as a result of her pelvic inflammatory disease the tube is damaged already. She does not need a laparotomy (C) as she is stable. A salpingotomy (D) involves opening the affected tube and removing the ectopic pregnancy. This would leave the tube in situ but there is the concern of a another ectopic in the future. This woman is an ideal candidate for methotrexate (B). Methotrexate is given IM as an anti-metabolite, and a further dose may need to be given a week later. There are strict criteria about its use, including a small ectopic, no fetal pulse, no clinical compromise and no free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas. Another option is to keep her in hospital and repeat her beta hCG in 48 hours (E). If the hCG falls, a tubal miscarriage is a possibility. The benefits of methotrexate compared to surgery are that there is an increased chance of future fertility.",

Although her presentation today could represent another sexually transmitted infection or pelvic inflammatory disease, the history of deep dyspareunia and post-coital bleeding, coupled with a cervix which bleeds on contact in a woman who is sexually active, should immediately raise suspicion of cervical cancer.

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 32,
    "topic": "Investigation in emergency gynaecology",
    "explanation": "Apart from (C) all the options are potential diagnostic tools in assessing this woman: computed tomography is avoided if at all possible in pregnancy as it exposes the fetus to unacceptably high doses of ionizing radiation, the teratogenicity of which is highest in the first trimester. This woman is pregnant with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Such patients should be treated as having an ectopic pregnancy until otherwise proven. Clinical assessment (D) and serial beta hCG measurements (B) would be the routine initial measures in assessing this woman, but they are by no means definitive in providing a diagnosis. In addition, meaningful information can only be drawn with a second beta hCG measurement, some 48 hours later. At this level of serum beta hCG an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on transvaginal ultrasound (E), so it offers in this case the highest chance of providing a definitive answer to the ectopic pregnancy question. Diagnostic laparoscopy (A) may be employed if an ectopic pregnancy is suggested by the ultrasound scan, but it is not appropriate to perform this on a stable patient without first performing imaging. An early pregnancy is usually visible on transvaginal ultrasound if the serum beta hCG is above 1000 mIU/mL, and certainly above 1500 mIU/mL. Women with this level of hCG in whom no pregnancy can be detected on ultrasound scan should be managed as having a pregnancy of unknown location, which may included inpatient admission until ectopic pregnancy is definitively excluded.",

    "explanation": "This woman has lower abdominal pain and a positive pregnancy test with signs of haemodynamic instability: an ectopic pregnancy (C) should therefore be excluded urgently. Ovarian torsion (E) and ruptured ovarian cysts (A) classically present with a sudden onset abdominal pain, and are not commonly associated with a significant tachycardic hypotension. Differentiating between them can be difficult. However, the natural history of the pain is often helpful. Both may present with sudden onset pain, but usually the pain of ovarian torsion will be out of keeping with the clinical findings and will not improve with simple analgesia. Indeed it does not normally decrease significantly at all. By contrast, the pain of cyst rupture, while being of sudden onset, is often reduced by simple analgesia and may decrease gradually as the peritoneal lining (having been irritated by leaking fluid or blood from the cyst, causing pain) absorbs intraperitoneal free fluid. A woman with a perforated appendicitis (D) would often show signs of sepsis, including fever and peritonitis, and pain is normally localized initially to the central abdomen or right iliac fossa. At this level of beta hCG, an intrauterine pregnancy would normally be visible on transvaginal ultrasonography. Of the two ectopic pregnancy options available, cervical ectopics (B) would normally be demonstrable on transvaginal ultrasound. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a surgical emergency requiring prompt assessment, resuscitation and urgent surgery. The urgency of the situation is even more pronounced if there are signs of haemodynamic instability, such as in this case where there is evidence of hypovolaemic shock.",

In fact there is an increased risk of heart disease in women who start HRT 10 years after the menopause. In addition to the above there is a risk of endometrial cancer in oestrogen-only HRT which is related to duration of treatment. In general, if the woman still has her uterus progestogens must be given to prevent endometrial cancer developing. The risk of stroke (B) depends on age but there are additional 1–4 cases per 1000 women on HRT. The risk of breast cancer (C) is higher for patients in their 60s taking combined HRT. The risk with combined HRT taken over the age of 60 for 10 years will lead to an extra 36 cases of breast cancer per 1000 women. The risk of ovarian cancer (D) increases very slightly with an extra case per 1000 women.

A theca lutein cyst is a kind of ovarian cyst made of multiple luteinized follicular cells and is most common when the ovary is exposed to raised levels of beta hCG, as in multiple pregnancy. These cysts, like any other ovarian cyst, can rupture and bleed slowly onto the peritoneum where they cause irritation manifested as lower abdominal pain. Appendicitis (B) classically produces central pain localizing to the right iliac fossa. It is less common in pregnant women than non-pregnant women. Urinary tract infection (E) can cause lower abdominal pain, although this is usually central and associated with dysuria and frequency, which are not present here. Diverticulitis can cause left-sided pain, but patients are often febrile and commonly have a raised C-reactive protein and leukocytosis. Diverticulitis is an uncommon presentation at this age.",

    "explanation": "Demonstrating  that  ethics  and  law  are  truly  alive  in  obstetrics  and  gynaecology,  this  case  is  drawn  from  the  one  author’s  own  experience  (modified to protect confidentiality). There are two principal issues: one, the  ethics  and  legality  of  treating  a  patient  detained  under  the  Mental  Health  Act  and  two,  acting  in  the  best  interests  of  a  patient  who  lacks  capacity. It is not lawful to detain someone under the Mental Health Act for treatment of any disease other than a psychiatric condition. Therefore options (A) and (B) are incorrect. Section 5 orders are emergency holding powers to detain patients who are already inpatients and for whom there is no time to apply for another more appropriate detention order. Section 2  orders  are  usually  used  for  patients  in  the  community  who  require  detention in hospital for assessment, although in practice they may also receive  treatment  (for  the  disease  necessitating  detention)  as  part  of  an  assessment. In this case, the patient has not shown psychotic symptoms and  it  is  unlikely  that  she  would  require  formal  admission.  Options  (C)  and  (D)  imply  that  the  patient  lacks  capacity.  The  question  makes  clear  that this patient: (1) understands the information she is being given about risk, (2) retains the information, as she is repeatedly refusing care despite understanding  the  consequences  of  waiting,  and  (3)  can  weigh  that  information in the balance and communicate her choice. These three tests are met and the patient has capacity to make the decision about caesarean section. A patient with capacity can refuse treatment, even if that decision is  irrational  or  against  the  advice  of  family  or  friends.  The  only  option  left  is  for  the  clinician  to  encourage  engagement  with  the  care  team  and recommended plan (E). She may require treatment – perhaps under detention  –  for  the  schizophrenia,  but  formal  admission  for  this  might  deter her from accepting advice from all doctors and therefore reduce the likelihood of her accepting a caesarean section.",

First  is  the  concept  of  best  interests  in  relation  to  a  patient  who  is  unable  to  consent  themselves  (in this case due to unconsciousness), and second is the idea of advance directives. This woman has been brought to accident and emergency in a life-threatening condition. It is likely that the transfusion of blood would be  part  of  life-saving  management  of  her  condition.  In  an  emergency,  patients  must  always  be  given  life-saving  treatment  unless  they  have  made a valid advance directive declining such treatment. To be valid, an advance directive must be viewed by the treating clinician, signed by the patient  who  had  capacity  to  make  the  decision  at  the  time  of  signing,  and  be  witnessed.  The  advance  directive  is  not  present  in  accident  and  emergency  in  this  case,  nor  is  there  evidence  of  any  discussion  with  her  treating  clinician.  Therefore,  in  this  case,  a  normative  assessment  of  the  patient’s  best  interests  would  err  on  the  side  of  giving  life- saving treatment, e.g. blood (E).

    "page": 43,
    "topic": "Ethics in the emergency setting",
    "explanation": "In  this  case,  the  wishes  of  the  husband  are  largely  irrelevant.  The  patient  is  in  a  life-threatening  condition  and  lacks  capacity  due  to  unconsciousness.  In  such  circumstances,  life-saving  treatment  must  be  given  if  it  is  in  the  patient’s  best  interests  as  judged  by  the  attending  clinician. This woman is likely to be bleeding into her abdomen from a ruptured  viscus:  she  is  gravely  ill  and  close  to  cardiac  arrest.  A  young  woman can compensate significantly for blood loss, and the fact that she has significant signs of hypovolaemic shock indicates the likely massive loss  of  circulating  volume.  Replacement  with  fluids  (A)  or  (B)  will  not  stop the haemorrhage, though they will buy time. Transferring this peri- arrest patient (E), even to ITU (C), is unwise as she may arrest en route, for example, in a lift, where facilities are not available. In addition, inotropes may increase the cardiac output but they do not compensate for the lack of  circulation  caused  by  continuing  haemorrhage.  A  senior  obstetrician  here  has  advised  that  delivery  of  the  fetus  in  accident  and  emergency  (D)  would  help  with  her  resuscitation.  Perimortem  caesarean  section  is  usually  performed  as  a  means  of  saving  the  life  of  the  mother  rather  than  the  fetus.  The  gravid  uterus  reduces  venous  return  and  therefore  preload on the heart, in turn reducing stroke volume and cardiac output. Moreover,  the  placental  oxygen  requirement  is  huge  and  reduces  the  ability of what little circulating volume she has left to perfuse her vital organs. Perimortem caesarean would remove these obstacles to effective resuscitation  of  this  critically  ill  trauma  patient.  It  is  usually  performed  through a midline incision: such an incision would also then give access to the abdomen for a general surgeon to perform a trauma laparotomy.",

The girl meets the Fraser Guidelines for  giving  contraceptive  treatment  or  advice  to  those  under  16:  she  understands the advice; she cannot be persuaded to tell her parents; she is likely – given that she has a boyfriend – to continue having sex and her health  will  suffer  if  contraceptive  treatment  is  not  provided  (pregnancy  is  inherently  more  dangerous  than  non-pregnancy).

She has been with the same partner for 4 years since the death of her husband with whom she had four children. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "topic": "Dyspareunia",
    "explanation": "Dyspareunia  is  the  sensation  of  pain  before,  during  or  after  penetrative  sexual contact with the vagina. It is most commonly associated with pain during penetration. It should not be confused with vaginismus which is the  inability  to  engage  in  penetrative  sex  due  to  involuntary  spasm  of  the pubococcygeus muscle. In younger (although not exclusively young) patients  for  whom  there  is  new  dyspareunia  it  is  important  to  exclude  sexually transmitted infections and acute intrapelvic conditions (such as ovarian cysts or appendicitis) and to ensure there is no cervical pathology (for  example,  cervical  carcinoma  in  situ).  The  vaginal  lining  of  women  who have gone through the menopause progressively atrophies with age as the residual level of circulating estrogens decreases. Estrogens ensure the  vaginal  lining  remains  moist  and  expansile,  comfortably  permitting  sexual  penetration.  Without  exposure  to  these  estrogens,  the  lining  can  become  atrophied.  Friction  to  an  unlubricated  atrophic  vagina  (D)  can  cause  extreme  discomfort.  Sexually  transmitted  infections  (B),  although  increasingly  common  in  older  couples,  are  rare  in  those  beyond  the  menopause.  Bacterial  vaginosis  (E)  is  uncommon  in  post-menopausal  women also. Although these two diagnoses would be unlikely, it is still important  to  exclude  them  by  careful  vaginal  examination  and  swabs.  Ovarian  malignancy  (A)  is  not  suggested  by  this  clinical  presentation  here.  In  addition,  she  has  no  risk  factors  for  ovarian  cancer  (including  HRT)  and  has  the  protective  factor  of  having  had  four  pregnancies.  Discoid  lupus  erythematous  (C)  is  a  complex  atrophying  lesion  of  the  skin  similar  in  aetiology  to  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  but  without  the  systemic  features.  Although  it  may  result  in  dyspareunia,  through  atrophy of the vaginal lining, there are no other features here to suggest an autoantibody-mediated disease, and the usual age of onset for discoid lupus is 30 years.",

    "topic": "Lower abdominal pain",
    "explanation": "Differentiating  between  pain  caused  by  gynaecological  or  by  surgical  pathology  is  a  difficult  but  important  and  common  problem.  Knowing  the natural history of the diseases can help. Ovarian torsion (E) classically presents  with  a  sudden  onset  pain  on  one  side  which  does  not  improve  and is constantly there. It often requires opiate analgesia. Ovarian torsion is an important diagnosis as the risk of compromising the ovarian blood supply  is  high,  with  ovarian  compromise  and  possible  infarction.  In  this  case the pain is fluctuant not constant, and although torsion may cause an inflammatory response accounting for the raised CRP, it would not cause a leukocytosis which is present here. Tubo-ovarian abscess (D) and PID (C) would normally lead to a fever, with a high white cell count. Tubo-ovarian abscesses can be a sequel of untreated PID and their early courses may be similar.  However,  a  woman  with  a  frank  abscess  in  the  pelvis  (D)  would  likely be much more seriously ill than the patient here (or a patient with PID) and the fever would usually be swinging. Serum beta hCG can detect the earliest of pregnancies, so an ectopic pregnancy (B) is highly unlikely here  given  the  negative  serum  hCG.  A  normal  ultrasound  unfortunately  cannot completely rule out adnexal or gastrointestinal pathology, not least because transabdominal ultrasound often cannot visualize the appendix.",

    "topic": "Heavy menstrual bleeding",
    "explanation": "This  woman  has  a  significant  normocytic  anaemia  as  a  result  of  blood  loss, sufficient to cause a faint earlier in the day. The most likely cause is her menorrhagia. Initially she should be appropriately resuscitated (A). Although  she  is  haemodynamically  stable,  with  continuing  blood  loss  she  may  decompensate  rapidly.  Therefore,  large-bore  venous  access  is  warranted.  Fully  cross-matched  blood  is  the  safest  option  of  the  three  transfusion  options  presented  and  will  usually  take  around  45  minutes  to  prepare  compared  to  20  minutes  for  group-specific  blood.  As  this  patient is currently stable, one cannot justify the potential complications* associated with giving group-specific (D) or even ungrouped (O-negative, or universal donor) blood (C). A laparotomy (B) is not indicated here as the  patient  is  haemodynamically  stable  and  has  a  medically  treatable  cause for the (albeit severe) anaemia.  *  When  transfusion  of  packed  red  cells  is  necessary,  the  urgency  of  the  situation  dictates  how  it  is  tested  before  being  given.  The  risk  of  transfusion  reactions,  particularly  acute  haemolytic  reactions  where  there  is  ABO  incompatability,  is  increased with the use of donor blood which has not been fully cross-matched with the  recipient’s.  Cross-matching  takes  about  45  minutes  and  involves  physically  mixing  the  donor  and  recipient  blood  and  testing  for  transfusion  reactions.  The  next safest, and second quickest, transfusion option is group-specific blood. The recipient’s blood is tested for ABO group and antibodies and a compatible blood is selected from the blood bank. This grouping process takes around 15 minutes. Group O-negative (universal donor) blood is given in life-threatening emergencies only as it carries the greatest risk of transfusion reactions. When O-negative blood is used, no tests on the recipient blood are performed before administration of the donor red cells.",

    "explanation": "Ovarian cysts in post-menopausal ladies can be managed conservatively if  they  meet  certain  criteria.  A  risk  of  malignancy  index  (RMI)  can  be  calculated  using  the  CA  125  value,  the  characteristics  of  the  cyst  on  ultrasound  and  the  menopausal  status.  The  features  of  concern  on  ultrasound  are  bilateral  cysts,  multiloculated  cysts,  solid  components,  ascites and metastases. RMI <50 has a 3 per cent chance of cancer. RMI between 50 and 250 has a 20 per cent chance of cancer and an RMI >250 has a 75 per cent chance of cancer. If the cyst is simple and less than 5 cm in diameter with a CA 125 <30 U/ml then conservative management (D) would  be  appropriate  with  4-monthly  scans  and  CA  125  levels  for   1 year. Immediate referral to a specialist (A) is therefore not required in this case. Similarly, surgical management to remove an ovary (C) or both ovaries and the uterus (E) is unwarranted in a woman with no significant pathology.  Laparoscopic  cystectomy  ((B)  removal  of  the  cyst,  normally  by aspirating the cyst contents and excising the cyst capsule to prevent recurrence)  would  be  a  potential  management  option  if  the  patient  was  sufficiently  symptomatic  and  all  other  therapies  had  failed.  A  cyst  this  small is unlikely to cause significant symptoms.",

    "explanation": "This woman is post-menopausal. Whenever you see a woman with post- menopausal bleeding it is imperative to exclude cancer of the cervix or endometrium.  She  has  had  a  normal  smear  history  and  there  is  normal  cervical  appearance  on  examination  so  carcinoma  of  the  cervix  is  unlikely and repeat testing (E) is not required. She is still sexually active and  may  well  have  a  sexually  transmitted  infection  so  triple  swabs  (B)  would be a sensible part of an overall management plan. She has no other menopausal symptoms and is now 79 so starting HRT is not advisable (D). Topical vaginal oestrogen like Vagifem (A) may be appropriate. However, before prescribing oestrogens, an ultrasound of her pelvis (C) should be arranged  to  make  sure  that  her  endometrial  thickness  is  <4  mm.  This  is  the  most  important  investigation  as  it  would  confirm  or  deny  the  most  serious differential diagnosis (endometrial cancer).

    "explanation": "This  woman’s  disease  is  severe  and  it  is  most  likely  that  the  specialist  will  want  to  treat  her  with  medication  and  then  perform  a  second- look  laparoscopy  to  remove  any  disease  that  remains.  Danazol  (A)  has  anti-oestrogenic  and  anti-progestogenic  effects  and  is  licensed  for  3–6  months.  Triptorelin  (B)  is  a  gonadotrapin-releasing  hormone  agonist  that  creates  a  temporary  artificial  menopause  by  reducing  the  follicle- stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels. This is an excellent option  for  up  to  6  months.  After  that  there  is  the  risk  of  loss  of  bone  mineral  density.  Microgynon  30  (C)  is  a  combined  oral  contraceptive  pill.  Tranexamic  acid  (D)  is  an  antifibrinolytic  used  in  the  management  of mennorhagia. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (E) is a progestogen. The answer  to  this  question  depends  on  the  patient  but  triptorelin  followed  by  another  laparoscopy  probably  gives  this  woman  the  best  chance  of  disease clearance.",

    "explanation": "This  woman  is  menopausal.  When  considering  HRT  a  full  history  is  important  to  highlight  any  important  past  medical  history,  including  venous  thromboembolism  or  cancer.  The  next  step  is  to  assess  for  the  uterine  function.  If  the  woman  has  not  had  a  hysterectomy  you  must  always make sure she has constant or cyclical progestogens to reduce the risk  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  and  endometrial  cancer.  In  this  case  the  woman already has a source of progestegens – the Mirena – so prescribing oestrogen alone would be appropriate (A). Elleste Solo contains estradiol alone  while  Elleste  Duet  (B)  also  contains  norethisterone  (a  progestogen,  which  is  not  required  here).  Evorel  (E)  is  another  combined  oestradiol  and  norethisterone  preparation.  Again,  the  progestogen  component  is  unnecessary  here.  Vagifem  (C)  is  used  as  a  local  treatment  for  atrophic  vaginitis,  not  for  systemic  vasomotor  symptoms.  Oestrogen  implants  (D)  can  be  very  helpful  at  dealing  with  symptoms  but  supraphysiological  levels of oestrogen can lead to a rapid recurrence of vasomotor symptoms when levels begin to fall.",

For  women  who  have  no  structural  uterine  abnormality  and  present  for  treatment  for  the  first  time,  NICE  guidance  recommends  the  use  of  levonorgestrel-releasing  intrauterine systems (A) (e.g. Mirena coil) which in addition to reducing or stopping menstrual bleeding are contraceptive. Fertility returns soon after removal of the Mirena coil, so it is appropriate for women who have not undergone the menopause. Tranexamic acid (B) and mefanamic acid (D) and their concomitant use (D) are now second line treatments for HMB: tranexamic acid alone is most commonly prescribed (and recommended by NICE) as the principal pharmaceutical agent given the harsher side effects (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) of mefanamic acid.

    "explanation": "This woman has had a very long latent phase of labour (the latent phase usually being no longer than 24 hours). Her cervix is now 4 cm and she is in the active phase of labour. Unfortunately, the fetal position of occipito- posterior is associated with slower labours. She has not made progress over a 4-hour period so an assessment into whether there is a problem with the powers  (contractions),  passage  (shape  of  pelvis)  and  passenger  (size  and  position) needs to be undertaken. There is likely to be a significant amount of time left before baby is born. All question choices are analgesia options in labour. Remifentanil (A) is given through an infusion pump and tends to be used where there is a contraindication to having an epidural or a spinal. Pethidine (B) has been given before but had little effect so she is unlikely to want this again. Some hospitals use diamorphine (C) instead of pethidine. There is little difference between the two with some units preferring one or  the  other.  All  opiates  primarily  have  a  sedative  effect  rather  than  an  analgesic  effect  in  labour.  Entonox  (E)  can  be  a  helpful  adjunct  to  pain  relief  but  it  is  unlikely  that  this  will  be  enough  to  ease  her  through  the  remainder  of  the  labour.  An  epidural  (D)  would  be  the  most  appropriate  analgesia  to  offer  this  woman.  This  is  based  on  the  expected  length  of  labour ahead and also the likelihood of augmentation with syntocinon as she has made little progress in the active stage of labour.",

In maternal immune thrombocytopenia (C) there is a risk that the fetus may also have a low platelet count. HPV (B) is the correct answer as FBS does not increase the risk to the fetus.

    "explanation": "If  the  cord  is  felt  below  the  presenting  part  with  ruptured  membranes,  there  is  a  cord  prolapse.  This  is  an  obstetric  emergency  since  the  cord  can  either  become  obstructed  or  go  into  spasm  and  starve  the  fetus  of  oxygen. Delivery needs to be expedited. Answer (A) is partially correct as you will need help and probably need IV access. Help is very important here.  You  will  need  trained  obstetric,  anaesthetic  and  midwifery  staff.  Generally,  women  with  cord  prolapse  should  be  delivered  immediately,  in theatre. If the cervix is not fully dilated, they should be delivered by grade 1 caesarean section (B). In this case however, a vaginal delivery is the quickest option. She is a multiparous woman with a favourable fetal head position which is low in the pelvis. Answer (C) is inappropriate as delivery  needs  to  be  as  quick  as  possible  and  an  episiotomy  alone  will  not guarantee delivery of the fetus. Elevating the presenting part is very important as this will relieve pressure on the cord, but not with a pack (E). In the community the midwife should either use their hand to move the fetal head from the cord, or a catheter can be inserted into the bladder and filled  with  500  mL  normal  saline  to  elevate  the  presenting  part.  Answer  (D) would be the best option in this case as it is most likely to effect the quickest delivery.",

After  72  hours  her cervix is 5 cm dilated. Four hours later she is still 5 cm dilated. On abdominal examination the fetus appears to be a normal size. The fetal head position is left occipito-transverse, and the station is −1. There is no moulding but a mild caput. She  is  contracting  two  times  in  every  10  minutes  and  has  an  epidural  in  situ. You are asked to review and make a management plan. What would be the most appropriate plan?",

    "topic": "Active management of labour",
    "explanation": "This  question  focuses  on  delay  in  the  first  stage  of  labour.  We  know  that she is in active labour as her cervix is 5 cm dilated (active labour is usually believed to have commenced once the cervix is more than 3 cm dilated).  When  considering  labour  we  must  think  about  the  ‘passage,  passenger  and  powers’.  This  woman’s  labour  has  arrested,  and  she  is  only  contracting  twice  every  10  minutes.  It  is  technically  difficult  to  assess  the  ‘passage’  but  one  can  gauge  obstruction  when  performing  a  vaginal examination by assessing the degree of caput or moulding of the head.  The  ‘passenger’  can  be  similarly  difficult  to  assess  but  abdominal  examination  is  mandatory  to  assess  the  size  of  the  baby  and  gauge  how  much  fetal  head  remains  in  the  abdomen.  Putting  this  together  it  would  appear  that  the  reason  for  the  arrest  of  labour  is  a  suboptimal  contraction pattern. Option (A) is not appropriate as this woman’s labour has not progressed in the last 4 hours. This woman may end up requiring caesarean  delivery  (B)  but  at  this  point  it  is  more  appropriate  to  offer  augmentation.  It  is  not  appropriate  to  intermittently  monitor  a  labour  augmented by oxytocin so (C) is also incorrect: augmentation of labour carries  a  risk  of  hyperstimulation  and  thus  requires  continuous  fetal  monitoring. This woman is now in labour so there is no place for further PGE₂ (D) to dilate the cervix. Option (E) is the best answer. There may be debate about the timing of the subsequent examination but the aim is to achieve a vaginal delivery.",

In reality, the only proven benefit is a reduction in neonatal seizures. Currently, there is no clear evidence of a reduction in perinatal mortality or hypoxic brain injuries. However, the CTG is very sensitive so if the fetus becomes acidotic then it will pick this up as change becoming suspicious/pathological. However, it is not very specific, with  a  high  false-positive  rate.  Nearly  50  per  cent  of  babies  delivered  because of a pathological CTG will have normal blood gases. A monitoring tool which had low sensitivity and low specificity (C) would be of no use. A  monitoring  tool  with  low  sensitivity  and  high  specificity  (D)  would  seldom have a false-positive result; however, it would miss patients with the condition you were looking for.

    "explanation": "Stillbirth is a tragic and often unpredictable event. There is an increase in stillbirths with diabetes. In this case, stillbirth may have been avoidable if the woman had attended hospital sooner than 72 hours after noticing a  loss  of  fetal  movements.  Induction  of  labour  for  an  intrauterine  death  normally  involves  using  mifepristone  for  cervical  ripening  and  misoprostol (A, B) to bring about the onset of contractions. Dinoprostone (D)  is  also  used  routinely  in  many  institutions  for  induction  of  labour.  Induction with misoprostol alone (C) in a woman with an unripe cervix is  unlikely  to  be  successful.  In  this  scenario,  however,  the  complicating  factor is that there is no liquor and this baby is transverse at term.

It  is  often  heralded  by  the  ‘turtleneck’  sign, where the head delivers but then appears to retract. It is an obstetric emergency. A series of manoeuvres are performed in a set order, the most important of which is placing the woman into McRobert’s position (A) (knees and legs maximally flexed) to give the pelvic outlet its maximum possible diameter.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  baby  will  deliver  spontaneously  with  this  manoeuvre.  Placing  the  woman  on  all  fours  (B)  and  internal  rotational  manoeuvres  (C)  may  all  be  attempted,  and  suprapubic  pressure  if  McRobert’s  position  have  failed  to  disimpact  the  shoulder,  but  they  are  not the first step. Caesarean delivery is a last-ditch attempt to deliver the baby if all other methods have failed (E); in addition it requires Zavanelli’s manoeuvre,  where  the  baby  is  manually  replaced  into  the  uterine  cavity.

    "topic": "Complications of labour",
    "explanation": "This  woman  is  likely  to  have  suffered  a  uterine  rupture,  a  potentially  catastrophic  event  for  both  her  and  her  baby.  Although  signs  and  symptoms are often subtle, the presentation here would strongly suggest rupture.  Often  there  is  significant  fetal  heart  rate  abnormality  following  rupture,  and  the  tocometer  will  not  register  any  contractions.  Immediate  surgical  intervention  (D)  is  necessary  to  save  the  life  of  the  baby  and  mother, who is at risk of haemorrhagic shock. A ‘crash’ caesarean delivery is  normally  performed  with  subsequent  repair,  if  possible,  of  the  uterus,  although  a  caesarean  hysterectomy  is  sometimes  necessary.  In  this  case  formal  ultrasound  offers  little  more  useful  information  than  can  be  garnered from the CTG (other than clarification of the presence of a fetal heart rate) (A). This should never replace emergency delivery if rupture is clearly present. FBS (B) is useful in labour when a CTG trace has become suspicious but in this case it has no place. Using an oxytocin infusion (E) would be contraindicated in the presence of suspected uterine rupture as it increases the strength and frequency of contractions and could exacerbate the rupture.

    "topic": "Obstetric anaesthesia",
    "explanation": "Epidural  anaesthesia  is  commonplace  on  a  labour  ward.  Care  must  be  taken when offering patients epidurals to consider conditions that might make  the  procedure  more  difficult.  Absolute  contraindications  include  patient  refusal,  allergies  to  anaesthetic  agents,  systemic  infection,  skin  infection  over  the  intended  epidural  site,  bleeding  disorders,  platelet  count  less  than  80  000  /  mL  and  uncontrolled  hypotension.  Hypotension  (B) is of vital importance: the epidural will cause a peripheral vasodilation and  worsen  any  pre-existing  hypotension.  This  peripheral  vasodilation  is  the  reason  why  most  obstetric  anaesthetists  preload  the  patient  with  1  L  of  intravenous  fluid  before  giving  the  epidural  agent.  Relative  contraindications include conditions where the heart cannot adapt easily to circulatory changes such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis or mitral stenosis (C). Anatomical abnormalities like spina bifida  or  previous  spinal  surgery  (A)  may  make  an  epidural  technically  difficult  but  are  not  contraindications.  Neurological  conditions  such  as  multiple  sclerosis  may  be  exacerbated  by  an  epidural  but  again  this  is  not a contraindication. Most hospitals now run anaesthetic clinics prior to labour, which is the optimum time for an assessment to be made about the woman’s suitability for regional anaesthesia.",

    "explanation": "The pudendal nerve arises from the ventral rami of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th nerves  of  the  sacrum.  It  then  passes  between  piriformis  and  coccygeus  leaving the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It then crosses the ischium  and  re-enters  via  the  lesser  sciatic  foramen.  It  runs  forward  in  the pudendal canal with the pudendal vessels. The inferior anal (A) and inferior  haemorrhoidal  nerves  are  the  first  to  leave  the  pudendal  nerve.  The  main  benefit  of  the  pudendal  block  for  operative  obstetrics  is  the  effect it has on the perineal nerve (B). The dorsal nerve of the clitoris (C) is a terminal branch of the pudendal nerve that should not be involved in your delivery if you have to perform an episiotomy. Option (D) is another branch  of  the  pudendal  nerve.  The  block  will  help  analgesia  if  there  is  any  trauma  to  the  labia.  The  genital  branch  of  the  genitofemoral  nerve  (E)  does  not  innervate  the  perineum;  instead  it  arises  from  L1  and  L2  and descends over psoas major before entering the deep inguinal ring.

By  the  process  of  elimination,  only one answer is appropriate. The transfer of an unstable polytrauma patient  is  dangerous,  particularly  if  as  in  this  case  there  is  evidence  of  haemorrhagic  shock,  so  options  (A)  and  (B)  are  incorrect.  Steroids  (E)  for  lung  maturation  are  not  required  at  this  gestation.

Although  perimortem   caesarean   section   may   be   performed   in   accident   and   emergency,  this  woman,  although  unwell,  has  a  cardiac  output  which  may respond to resuscitative measures, so immediate caesarean delivery (D) is unwarranted and may put her at further risk.

Syntocinon (A) may well be part of the initial management. The crucial part of this question is how unwell she is. No obstetrician wants to perform a hysterectomy (D) on a 30-year-old but this may be necessary. She has already lost 5 L of blood so this has been a complicated operation so far. A B-Lynch suture (B) is an external uterine suture that helps uterine contraction. A balloon (E)  would  provide  internal  uterine  tamponade  against  any  bleeding  vessels. Internal iliac artery ligation (C) would prevent blood flow down the uterine artery reducing the blood volume reaching the uterus. All of the  above  could  be  part  of  her  management  but  in  this  case  she  is  so  unwell  that  performing  a  caesarean  hysterectomy  would  be  the  correct  course of management.",

Caesarean  section,  emergency  delivery  and  a  primiparity  are  independent  risk  factors  for  puerperal  psychosis.  It  commonly  presents  with  delusional  ideation  and  hallucinations,  with  a  religious  aspect  to  the  delusions  often  being  noticeable. It is clinically similar to bipolar affective disorder (B), though depressive  episodes  are  much  less  common  in  puerperal  psychosis,  and  depression (A) is not evident here. Schizophrenia (D) would normally be associated  with  third  person  hallucinations  which  are  not  present  here.  An acute confusional state is a clinical syndrome normally caused by a non-psychiatric  process  such  as  infection.  Although  hallucination  may  be  present,  as  in  this  case,  acute  confusional  state  classically  fluctuates  and its onset is much quicker, usually over the course of hours or a few days.  In  this  case,  her  behaviour  has  become  more  odd  over  the  course  of  a  fortnight,  and  there  are  features  of  frank  psychosis.  The  time  from  delivery within which acute-onset psychosis has occurred, coupled with the risk factors, makes puerperal psychosis the most sensible diagnosis.",

As  the  fetus  starts  to  breath,  the  pressure  in  the  pulmonary  circulation  lowers  and  right ventricular output increases (A). The pulmonary artery vasodilates, not constricts (D), to allow this new low-pressure system on the right side of the heart to develop. The increased flow through the pulmonary system leads to more venous return to the left side of the heart via the pulmonary veins, leading to an increase in the pressure on the left side.

    "explanation": "In a well-motivated mother, the inability to lactate so far after delivery is  a  cause  for  concern.  This,  coupled  with  an  absence  of  periods  requires  ruling  out  hypopituitarism  (C).  This  woman  suffered  a  post- partum  haemorrhage  significant  enough  to  cause  hypovolaemia.  Since  the  anterior  pituitary  is  hyperplastic  during  pregnancy,  it  is  acutely  sensitive  to  acute  falls  in  blood  pressure.  If  hypotension  is  severe,  necrosis  or  infarction  of  the  anterior  pituitary  can  occur,  rendering  it  hypofunctional,  i.e.  Sheehan’s  syndrome  (C).  This  can  commonly  result in absence of lactation and periods, fatigue and, less commonly, diabetes  insipidus.  This  is  the  opposite  of  panhyperpituitarism,  which  is  neither  a  recognized  post-partum  condition  nor  a  complication  of  post-partum  haemorrhage.  Post-partum  depression  (E)  can  occur  soon  after pregnancy or up to a year after delivery. Younger and unsupported mothers,  women  with  previous  depression  or  drug  use  and  those  with  a  strong  family  history  are  most  at  risk  of  post-partum  depression.  It  can cause fatigue and difficulty in breastfeeding, but is unlikely to stop periods  or  completely  prevent  any  lactation.  SIADH  (B)  would  present  with  features  of  hyponatraemia,  and  although  this  can  happen  after  Sheehan’s syndrome has been long established, it does not account for this  woman’s  symptoms  at  present.

    "explanation": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is very common, with about 60% of the population having had a prior infection. If it is contracted in pregnancy about  40–50%  of  fetuses  will  become  infected.  The  manifestations  of  such  an  infection  can  be  very  broad.  Complications  include  visual  and  hearing loss, microcephaly and long-term neurodevelopmental disability. Babies do not have hydrocephalus (so (A) is incorrect). HIV (B) infection is  screened  for  routinely  at  booking,  so  with  full  antenatal  care  you  should detect those mothers at risk. Admittedly, the flu-like illness here could represent seroconversion but you would not expect chorioretinitis or  hydrocephalus.  Group  B  Streptococcus  (D)  is  a  pathogen  that  is  present in the genital tract of 25% of women. It has the ability to cause infection in the baby in the puerperium but not hydrocephalus. Listeria monocytogenes (E) is a bacterium that is present in unpasteurized cheeses and  pâtés.  It  can  lead  to  miscarriage,  stillbirth  or  preterm  delivery.  The  correct  answer  is  (C)  –  toxoplasmosis.  This  is  caused  by  the  protozoon Toxoplasma gondii and can be contracted form undercooked meat and cat faeces. It can lead to chorioretinitis, macro- or microcephaly, convulsions and long-term neurodevelopmental delay. Initial infection in the mother is usually mild, and often she is not aware of it.",

    "explanation": "HPV  (C)  is  attributed  to  the  development  of  cervical  intraepithelial  neoplasia  and  adenocarcinoma.  Of  the  subtypes  of  HPV,  16  and  18  are  among  the  most  highly  oncogenic.  These  are  responsible  for  around   70 per cent of all cervical cancer cases. Routine vaccination against the virus is now offered to all girls at around 12 years of age. Herpes simplex (D)  is  responsible  for  oral  cold  sores  and  genital  herpes,  not  cervical  cancer. Candida albicans (A) is a yeast which causes vaginal candidiasis or ‘thrush,’ which can cause pain and embarrassing discharge. HIV (B) is a retrovirus which is now readily treatable but as yet incurable. Immune destruction  gradually  causes  the  onset  of  opportunistic  infection,  and,  eventually, an AIDS-defining infection. HIV-positive women are at high risk of contracting human papilloma virus and therefore at an increased risk of intraepithelial neoplasias. Treponema pallidum (E) is a spirochaete bacterium which is responsible for clinical syphilis infection. Histological examination  of  the  cervix  would  not  demonstrate  any  bacterium.  Although  young  women  with  syphilis  infection  would  be  more  likely  than  those  without  to  have  a  concurrent  HPV  infection,  and  therefore  a higher risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, there is no direct link between the two and the risk is raised due to the confounding effect of sexual behaviour.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 82,
    "topic": "Paediatric and adolescent gynaecology",
    "explanation": "Primary amenorrhoea is a failure to start periods. To begin menstruating, the  girl  must  be  structurally  normal  and  have  a  properly  functioning  hypothalamic-pituitary  axis  (HPA).  The  fact  that  this  girl  has  normal  external genitalia and has normal pubertal breast development suggests that secondary sexual development is occurring normally, and the HPA is functioning. The speculum examination reveals what is most likely to be haematocolpos – blood inside the vagina – the most common cause for which in the presence of amenorrhoea is an imperforate hymen (C). This is  where  the  hymen  does  not  separate  at  the  time  of  the  menarche  and  thereafter blood cannot escape with each period, but builds up behind the intact hymen. This would also explain her intermittent bloating. Patients with anorexia nervosa (D) would either have complete lack of secondary development, if the condition started early, or a secondary amenorrhoea. Turner’s syndrome (A) – XO karyotype – is associated with short stature, wide  carrying  angles,  a  broad  chest  and  a  lack  of  sexual  development.  Congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia  (B)  results  from  inadequate  cortisol  production  positively  feeding  back  on  adrenocorticotrophic  hormone  production,  resulting  in  adrenal  hyperplasia  and  excessive  adrogenic  cortisol  precursors.

    "explanation": "The pathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hydatidiform mole  (D).  Hydatidiform  moles  are  part  of  a  spectrum  of  pathological  pregnancies  and  are  essentially  benign  trophoblastic  tumours.  They  occur in between 1:20 000 and 1:50 000 pregnancies. Risk factors include extremes  of  age,  previous  molar  pregnancy  and  race;  an  increased  rate  of  molar  pregnancy  is  seen  in  people  from  South  East  Asia,  although  the  reasons  are  unclear.  Women  usually  present  with  unusual  or  heavy  bleeding  beyond  the  sixth  week  of  pregnancy  with  a  pregnancy  which  is  larger  than  dates  would  suggest.  Due  to  the  size  of  theca  lutein  cysts,  the  ovaries  are  often  enlarged.  Pre-eclampsia,  thyrotoxicosis  and  hyperemesis  gravidarum  are  common  in  molar  pregnancy.  Diagnosis  involves  clinical  assessment  for  the  features  above,  coupled  with  serum  beta  hCG  assessment  (which  is  often  significantly  higher  than  would  be  expected  in  an  early  pregnancy)  and  ultrasonography  which  may  demonstrate  a  classical  ‘snowstorm  appearance’.  Follow-up  is  of  vital  importance  to  ascertain  whether  the  hCG  level  is  falling:  if  it  does  not,  further treatment may be necessary, including surgical evacuation of the uterus. One in 80 women will go on to have a further molar pregnancy. Choriocarcinoma  (A)  is  also  a  form  of  gestational  trophoblastic  disease,  but  it  is  aggressive  and  malignant.  It  readily  metastasizes  to  the  lungs.  Closely  related  syncytiotrophoblasts  and  cytotrophoblasts  are  typical,  with  syncytiotrophoblasts  often  displaying  abnormal  nuclei  containing  cytoplasm  with  abnormally  high  eosiniphil  counts.  Hydatidiform  moles  can  rarely  progress  to  choriocarcinoma,  and  around  half  of  all  cases  of  choriocarcinoma  will  have  developed  from  a  hydatidiform  mole.  Degenerated uterine leimyoma (B) is the result of ‘red degeneration’ of a fibroid and would not show any histological features of pregnancy (e.g. trophoblasts).  A  complete  miscarriage  (E)  constitutes  a  failed  pregnancy  in which all products of conception have been expelled from the uterine cavity. As there is still tissue found at ERPC, this cannot be the diagnosis. Dysgerminomas (C) are germ cell tumours which would be histologically distinct  from  molar  pregnancy  by  the  presence  of  lobular  cells  with  fibrous stromal cells with lymphocytic invasion.",

Vaginal  hysterectomy  (A,  B)  is  a  suitable  surgical  therapy  for  women  who  have  completed  their  family,  have  a  normal  sized  uterus  (enabling  vaginal extraction) and would benefit from it (indications include uterine prolapse  and  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  among  others).  Vaginal  repairs  (A)  may  be  performed  concurrently  with  vaginal  hysterectomy,  either  of  the  anterior  wall  (anterior  colporrhapy)  or  posterior  wall  (posterior  colporrhapy)  for  cystocoele  and  rectocoele,  respectively.  TVT  is  a  procedure  for  urinary  stress  incontinence  involving  the  insertion  of  a  tape, not under tension, underneath the urethra to support failed native tissue. Of the two non-operative interventions available, estriol cream and a  shelf  pessary  (E)  are  most  likely  to  bring  symptomatic  relief  from  her  prolapse. Weight loss and pelvic floor exercises (D) would be appropriate non-medical  interventions,  though  in  a  woman  of  89  years  weight  loss  and effective pelvic floor exercises are probably as unachievable as they are inadvisable.",

    "explanation": "This  woman  has  symptoms  and  urodynamic  evidence  of  stress  incon- tinence.  She  does  not  have  any  urge  symptoms  or  frank  urinary  incon  tinence.  Fesoterodine  (A)  and  solifenacin  (D)  are  used  to  treat  urge  incontinence.  She  has  a  high  body  mass  index  (BMI)  which  is  an  independent risk factor for developing stress incontinence. Conservative options  should  be  attempted  before  more  complex  medical  or  surgical  stratgies. A TVT (C) or a transobturator tape (TOT) (E) are both appropriate surgical  options  for  persistent  stress  incontinence  but  simple  measures  should  be  undertaken  first  such  as  weight  loss,  smoking  cessation  and  physiotherapy  (B).  The  TOT  procedure  carries  a  lower  risk  of  iatrogenic  bladder damage as the tape is passed through the obturator foramen. The choice of procedure in practice often falls to the operator’s preference and surgical  experience.  In  the  presence  of  a  cystocoele,  an  anterior  repair  may be appropriate but not as a first line treatment for symptomatic stress incontinence. For this reason option (B) is the correct answer.",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 83,
    "topic": "Gynaecological infections (3)",
    "explanation": "The clinical history and examination findings make it clear that this is a Bartholin’s abscess. The paired Bartholin’s glands, about 0.5 cm in diameter, are commonly found at the 4- and 8-o’clock positions in the labia minora. They are normally non-palpable. Their role is to secrete vaginal lubricant into the vestibule via the Bartholin’s ducts during sexual arousal. If the ducts  become  blocked,  an  abscess  of  the  gland  can  develop.  Treatment  of this is normally with marsupialization (A): surgery involving opening the abscess and suturing its lining to the outside to create a permanent opening,  thereby  preventing  recurrence.  Oral  antibiotics  (B)  may  be  useful after surgery, or before if the abscess is small, but not when it is large  like  in  this  case.  Note  however  that  ofloxacin  and  metronidazole  are  agents  commonly  used  for  pelvic  inflammatory  disease  and  not  usually for abscesses. Sebaceous cystectomy (C), as the name implies, is a treatment for sebaceous cysts, and is only employed if the cyst is very symptomatic. Vaginal clotrimazole (D) is a treatment for thrush. Simple Bartholin’s  abscesses  do  not  require  specialist  assessment  in  a  vulval  clinic (E) unless there are signs of Bartholin’s gland malignancy which is very  rare  (<1:1 000 000).",

In  fact,  the  negative  feedback  loop  is  not  activated  –  the  pituitary  is  not  responding  to  the  low  oestradiol  levels  by  increasing  the  FSH  as  in  the  menopause.

A  microprolactinoma  can  be  diagnosed  on  MRI  of  the  brain.  Her  TSH  (B)  is  at  the  high  end  of normal but again is not pathological and could not explain her sub- fertility.

    "explanation": "Vesico-vaginal fistulae are common around the world, mainly as a result of  obstructed  labour.  The  fetal  head  can  sit  adjacent  to  the  bladder  for  days  before  medical  help  is  sought.  By  this  time  the  tissues  become  necrotic,  break  down  and  a  fistula  develops.  In  resource-rich  countries  the  most  common  cause  is  pelvic  surgery.  This  woman  may  have  a  connection  from  the  bladder  to  the  vagina.  A  simple  test  you  could  do  in  clinic  is  to  pass  a  catheter  and  fill  the  bladder  with  some  methylene  blue dye (C). You can then perform a speculum examination to see if the dye  is  in  the  vagina.  Second  line  investigation  would  involve  an  EUA  and cystoscopy (A).

    "question": "A 16-year-old girl presents to your surgery with a history of unprotected sexual intercourse  (UPSI)  70  hours  ago.  Her  last  menstrual  period  was  8  days  ago.  Her  only  past  medical  history  of  note  is  that  of  epilepsy  which  is  well  controlled  by  carbamazepine.  She  is  worried  about  becoming  pregnant,  does  not  want  her  mother  to  find  out  and  is  in  a  hurry  to  get  home  before  suspicions  are  raised.  Which of the following options are available to her?",
    "options": [
      "A.    Take the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) continuously for the next month",
      "B.    A copper intrauterine device (IUD) should be inserted with prior screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)",
      "C.     Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg should be given as she is within 72 hours of UPSI",

      "E.     Reassure her that she is in the safe part of her cycle and she should try and use condoms in the future "
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 86,
    "topic": "Emergency contraception",
    "explanation": "This  is  a  difficult  conversation  under  time  pressures.  Ideally  you  would  prefer  to  counsel  the  patient  about  all  the  options  of  emergency  contraception  and  the  ramifications  of  unprotected  sexual  intercourse.  An important part of your counselling will involve future contraception advice.  This  patient  has  three  options  for  emergency  contraception.  A  copper  IUD  (B)  inserted  up  to  5  days  after  the  UPSI,  the  progesterone  antagonist  Ulipristal  (D)  up  to  5  days  after  and  the  more  common  levonorgesterol 1.5 mg within 72 hours (C). She meets the timeline for all options. Importantly she is taking an enzyme inducer carbamazepine so you could not guarantee the success of levonorgesterol. The Diploma of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (DFSRH) recommends increasing  the  dose  of  levonorgesterol  to  3  mg  but  this  is  off  licence.  A  copper  coil  would  be  the  most  appropriate  contraception  under  these  circumstances,  also  allowing  you  to  perform  a  full  STI  screen  simultaneously.  Option  (A)  would  not  be  effective  as  an  emergency  contraception and she is on an enzyme-inducing drug. Option (E) is not appropriate  as  depending  on  her  cycle  length  she  may  well  ovulate  in  the  next  5–6  days.  Sperm  can  survive  for  a  week  so  she  may  well  fall  pregnant if no action is taken.",

    "question": "A  40-year-old  woman  comes  to  your  clinic  alone  wanting  an  effective  form  of  contraception.  She  has  two  children  from  a  previous  marriage  and  has  recently  started a new relationship. She says that she does not want any further children. She has regular heavy periods, no menopausal symptoms and she is otherwise well with no past medical history. A recent ultrasound showed a normal sized uterus and pipelle biopsy revealed normal secretory endometrial tissue. What is the most appropriate form of contraception?",
    "options": [
      "A. Combined oral contraceptive pill with <30 μg of oestrogen",
      "B. Mirena coil",
      "C. Laparoscopic sterilization",
      "D.   Vasectomy",
      "E. Total abdominal hysterectomy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 87,
    "topic": "Contraception",
    "explanation": "Although   there   is   much   in   the   press   about   the   cardiovascular/ carcinogenic/venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  risks  of  the  COCP  there  is  no  contraindication  to  prescribing  them  in  a  low  risk  woman  (A).  The  DFRSH states that there is a small increase in the risk of breast cancer and a recent study suggested that VTE risk was lower if oestrogen was <30 μg. The Mirena coil (B) would be a good choice of contraception as she has a normal endometrium and heavy periods. She must be warned that she can expect up to 6 months of irregular bleeding post insertion but a third of  women  at  1  year  have  no  periods  and  70  per  cent  report  significant  reduction in bleeding 12 months after insertion. Laparoscopic sterilization (C)  is  appropriate  if  she  really  does  not  want  more  children.  She  is  still  only 40 and in a new relationship and may change her mind so this would not be first line. Similarly, a hysterectomy (E) would not be appropriate purely for contraceptive reasons in an otherwise well woman. Vasectomy (D)  is  an  excellent  form  of  contraception  (one  in  2000  failure  rate)  but  you would need to speak to her partner about this. Most clinicians would recommend  the  Mirena  coil  for  this  woman  as  it  will  treat  her  heavy  periods and provide an effective contraception for the next 5 years.",

    "question": "In a busy gynaecology clinic you are assessing a 22-year-old woman who has not had a period for 18 months. She is not pregnant and previously had regular periods. She  has  had  two  surgical  terminations  of  pregnancies  (STOP),  an  underactive  thyroid  gland  and  an  appendectomy.  Clinical  examination  is  unremarkable  with  a  BMI  kg/m²  of  20.  Biochemical  investigations  reveal  a  T4  of  17  pmol/L,  TSH  4.6 kg/m², prolactin of 570 mU/L, and testosterone of 42 ng/dL. LH and FSH are normal.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 87,
    "topic": "Secondary amenorrhoea",
    "explanation": "PCOS  (A)  is  a  multisystem  disorder  classically  diagnosed  by  two  of  the  following  three  criteria:  anovulation/oligo-ovulation,  biochemical  or  physical evidence of hyperandrogenism and an ultrasound scan showing 12 or more follicles in the ovary. This woman has secondary amenorrhoea but has no evidence of PCOS physically, biochemically or on ultrasound. Her prolactin level (B) is at the high end of normal. With a prolactinoma one should be vigilant for visual field defects. If the adenoma compresses the optic chiasm you can develop visual field defects. Other symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia  include  galactorrhea.  Sheehan’s  syndrome  (C)  is  a  post-partum complication, classically after a large haemorrhage causing hypoperfusion  of  the  pituitary  gland  leading  to  ischaemia  and  necrosis.  She  has  not  carried  a  pregnancy  past  the  first  trimester  so  this  is  not  possible. Her BMI is normal but further questioning would be needed to certain whether this was the cause. In light of a normal LH and FSH, anorexia  (E)  being  the  cause  is  unlikely  as  it  leads  to  a  hypothalamic  hypogonadism.  Asherman’s  syndrome  (D)  is  intrauterine  scar  tissue  and  adhesion  formation  seen  after  instrumentation  of  the  uterus.  It  is  not  common  but  should  be  considered  with  a  history  of  two  STOPs.  To  diagnose, a hysteroscopy would need to be performed.",

    "page": 87,
    "topic": "Subfertility (2)",
    "explanation": "The  causes  of  subfertility  can  be  viewed  broadly  as  male  and  female.  Semen analysis is vital in the assessment of the subfertile couple. Female causes  include  anovulation,  tubal/uterine  blockage  and  endometriosis.  It  would  be  advisable  to  check  day  1–3  LH  and  FSH  as  well  as  a  mid- luteal phase progesterone (B). This will give you the best indication as to whether the woman is ovulating. If she is not ovulating then pregnancy will not be possible. Further investigations can include an ultrasound to look at the size of the uterus and the presence of fibroids/polyps. An HSG is an assessment of tubal patency. A laparoscopy (E) would be considered after all the above to investigate endometriosis and direct vision of tubal patency by passing dye through the cervix and watching it exit via the fimbrial ends of the fallopian tubes. (A) would not be an appropriate first step as day 14 – around ovulation – would provide little information to help your diagnosis. You would expect an LH surge to be present at this time.  A  mid-follicular  phase  progesterone  (C)  would  be  low.  Mid-luteal  phase  progesterone  >30  nmol/L  would  lead  you  to  believe  that  she  is  ovulating.  Answer  (D)  has  no  place  in  the  initial  investigation  as  it  is  important to know whereabouts in the cycle this woman is.",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 88,
    "topic": "Assisted reproduction",
    "explanation": "OHSS  is  diagnosed  after  ovarian  stimulation  in  IVF  cycles.  Thirty-three  per cent of all IVF cycles will lead to mild OHSS and 3–8 per cent into severe OHSS. It typically presents with abdominal pain and swelling and vomiting.  It  is  important  to  consider  differentials  including  an  ectopic  pregnancy, pelvic infection, ovarian cyst torsion or appendicitis. Classically the  blood  will  become  haemoconcentrated  (C)  with  a  hypoproteinaemia  and ascites (E) will be present which may lead to a pleural effusion (A). The  ovaries  will  be  enlarged  on  ultrasound  and  in  severe  OHSS  will  be  over  12  cm.  Due  to  the  haemoconcentration  these  patients  are  at  particularly high risk of venous thromboembolism (B) so thromboembolic decompression stockings and enoxaparin while in hospital is appropriate. This  is  partly  attributable  to  the  hypoproteinaemia  –  low  albumin  –  leading  to  decreased  intravascular  plasma  and  hypercoagulability.  If  the OHSS is severe there may be problems perfusing the kidneys well if much of the intravascular volume is being drawn into the third space by the  decrease  in  oncotic  pressure  in  the  blood  vessels.  This  may  lead  to  oliguria. Fluid balance and management is key to these patients.",

On examination she is of short stature, with a slightly widened neck and has no secondary sexual characteristics and there is no obvious  abnormality  of  the  external  genitalia.  What  is  the  most  likely  diagnosis  form this limited information?",
    "options": [
      "A. Androgen insensitivity syndrome",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 88,
    "topic": "Primary amenorrhoea",
    "explanation": "Androgen  insensitivity  syndrome  (AIS)  (A)  is  very  unlikely  in  a  female  as carriers are not generally affected and the likelihood of a fertile male with  AIS  is  very  small.  Turner’s  syndrome  (B)  is  most  likely  because  of  the  sexual  development,  short  stature  and  the  neck  webbing.  Turner’s  syndrome is 46×0 leading to gonadal dysgenesis and sterility. Congenital adrenal  hyperplasia  (C)  is  autosomal  recessive  and  is  a  disruption  of  steroid  production.  There  are  various  enzymes  that  lead  to  different  versions  but  the  most  common  is  21  hydroxylase  deficiency.  This  leads  to hyperandrogenism and virilization of the female genitalia. Kallmann’s syndrome  (D)  would  have  been  the  next  best  answer  as  it  is  a  result  of  decreased  gonadotrophin-releasing  hormone  leading  to  hypogonadism,  delayed puberty and lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Rokitansky’s syndrome  (E)  is  characterized  by  Müllerian  agenesis.  So  a  girl  will  be  46XX, will have ovaries that function and will develop secondary sexual characteristics. There will, however, be no development of fallopian tubes or uterus and she may have a shortened vagina.",

    "topic": "Vaginal discharge",
    "explanation": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is not felt to be a sexually transmitted disease but is seen in people who are sexually active. It is a result of an imbalance of  the  naturally  occurring  flora  in  the  vagina.  It  presents  as  an  off- white  offensive  discharge  with  a  fishy  odour.  Diagnosis  is  made  with  swabs showing clue cells and a loss of vaginal acidity. Trichomonas (D) is  a  separate  infection  caused  by  a  protozoon  that  leads  to  a  greenish  discharge. It is a sexually transmitted infection. All the other flora above are responsible for bacterial vaginosis. (A, B, C and E) can all cause BV secondary  to  the  reduction  in  the  normal  levels  of  lactobacilli  found  in  the vagina. This reduction may be due to a recent antibiotic course or a change in pH of the vagina allowing these other bacteria to multiply.",

    "explanation": "Cervical screening is an important public health strategy introduced to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancers. It is based on the premise that abnormal cells can be detected early, well before they undergo malignant change and appropriate treatment can be instituted to prevent progression to invasive disease. Women in the UK are first invited for cervical screening at 25 years of age and then every 3 years until 50, whereafter they are screened every 5 years. The programme ends when they are 65 years of age unless abnormal results have been shown. Mild dyskaryosis detected on one sample should prompt a repeat smear within 3 months. A second sample reported as mild dyskaryosis warrants referral for colposcopy (C). Knife cone biopsy (D) and loop excision (E) are normally performed only after a histological rather than cytological diagnosis of dyskaryosis. Referral for colposcopy should also be made after three consecutive borderline results at LBC, after two results of mild dyskaryosis, or when there is any moderate or severe dyskaryosis.",

    "topic": "Postoperative complications (1)",
    "explanation": "In a postoperative patient, a low haemoglobin count which is continuing to fall must always be treated as due to ongoing haemorrhage until proven otherwise. In this patient, the combination of the haemoglobin drop and increasing abdominal distension, alongside the umbilical pain, points towards an umbilical port site bleed. Where there is evidence of continuing blood loss, as in this case, resuscitation followed by reoperation (E) is the most appropriate management. Her paleness and shortness of breath are probably due to blood loss. Volume replacement (B) and blood transfusion (A) are appropriate management methods but they are ‘holding options’ and by no means definitive in correcting continuing surgical bleeding. Although abdominal distension may point to obstruction, requiring a nasogastric tube (D), in this situation and in the absence of vomiting it is an unlikely diagnosis. CTPA (C) to exclude pulmonary embolism is not indicated in the absence of other more specific signs pointing towards this diagnosis, and D-dimer would be raised after surgery anyway.",

Although she has been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which could account for her symptoms, a new diagnosis of IBS at this age is rare and treating these symptoms (E) without further investigation is inadvisable. The GP has rightly arranged a CA 125 test, which is high. In this case, ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis (B) should be organized as a matter of urgency. The results of this, coupled with the raised CA 125, will then determine the degree of urgency in relation to the potential diagnosis (D).

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 102,
    "topic": "Acid-base physiology",
    "explanation": "This woman is clearly very unwell with a profound alkalosis. As there is a low PCO2 as well as a raised bicarbonate, there is a mixed acid-base disturbance (E). In a purely metabolic alkalosis (A) the PCO2 should be higher, whereas with a pure respiratory alkalosis (B) one would expect a much lower compensatory bicarbonate, given that the respiratory alkalosis is likely to have been chronic. This is therefore a mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis (E). In this case, the respiratory alkalosis is most probably due to a high respiratory rate due to the significant acute pneumonia while the metabolic alkalosis is most probably due to the hypokalaemia (potassium 1.9 mmol/L), in turn caused by her repeated vomiting of potassium-rich gastric contents secondary to hyperemesis gravidarum. Answer (D) is a distractor which most candidates can easily dismiss: respiratory alkalosis is marked by low PCO2 due to an increased respiratory effort ‘blowing off’ the carbon dioxide, and a respiratory compensation would mean the patient had reduced but not normalized their respiratory rate. All respiratory alkaloses therefore have ‘inadequate respiratory compensation’!",

    "explanation": "A Wertheim’s hysterectomy (A) is an operation for cervical cancer. It involves removing the uterus, upper third of the vagina and all the parametrium. A total abdominal hysterectomy (B) would be an appropriate choice as it is important that the ovaries are removed as well. This woman may well be ideal candidate for a laparoscopic hysterectomy as she is multiparous, has mild prolapse, has an early stage endometrial cancer and has had no operations. The recovery time is much quicker compared to a laparotomy. For this reason answer (C) would be most appropriate. Subtotal hysterectomy (D) is inappropriate since not removing the cervix may inadvertently leave some malignant endometrial tissue. A pelvic exenteration (E) usually involves a Wertheim’s hysterectomy as well as a bowel resection of sorts (either abdominoperineal or anterior resection). This is employed for significant recurrent cervical and upper vaginal cancers.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 103,
    "topic": "Gynaecological oncology (2)",
    "explanation": "The diagnosis and management of ovarian cancers is principally surgical. A full work-up for women undergoing evaluation for ovarian cancer includes CT of the abdomen. This may, as in the case here, reveal extra-abdominopelvic disease which is classified as stage IV (metastatic) ovarian cancer. However, imaging does not replace the need for histological diagnosis at operation. A staging laparotomy establishes the type and extent of the primary cancer and allows optimal cytoreduction (or ‘debulking surgery’) (C) where as much of the disease as possible is removed at operation. Even in advanced cancers, the preferred treatment for all women who are fit for operation is optimal cytoreductive surgery. Chemotherapy may also be indicated since ovarian cancers are highly sensitive to platinum based agents and the vinca alkaloids. Indeed, many centres now pre-empt debulking surgery with chemotherapy (so-called interval debulking procedures). In an otherwise fit woman of 65 years, offering no active treatment for a disease (D) which can be effectively managed is inappropriate, unless the patient expressly wishes it. Total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy are often employed during surgery for early ovarian cancers. However, performing radiotherapy of another organ system (A) at the same time as radical surgery has significant risk attached. Aortopelvic lymphadenopathy (B) is not widely used given that it does not increase 5-year survival and is associated with operative risk.",

Chest x-ray demonstrates a left-sided pleural effusion. On further questioning the woman has had a poor appetite for the last 6 months and recently had some vaginal bleeding. An ultrasound revealed large quantities of ascites, which were drained. Analysis of the ascites shows a high protein content. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Congestive cardiac failure (CCF)",
      "B. Carcinoma of the ovary",
      "C. Meigs’ syndrome",
      "D. Cirrhosis of the liver",
      "E. Carcinoma of the cervix"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 103,
    "topic": "Pleural effusion",
    "explanation": "This woman is unwell as a result of the pleural effusion and ascites. All of the options can cause ascites and pleural effusions. The high protein content of the ascitic fluid suggests an inflammatory or malignant cause rather than CCF (A) or cirrhosis of the liver (D). CCF involves both left and right ventricular failure. Left ventricular failure will lead to pulmonary oedema while right-sided failure leads to hepatomegaly, ascites and peripheral oedema. Cirrhosis of the liver is characterised by ascites and hepatomegaly. Other complications may include oesophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy. The history of decreased appetite and vaginal bleeding raises the possibility of an advanced gynaecological cancer with metastatic spread outside the abdomen – (B) or (E). CCF (A) and hepatic cirrhosis (D) do not cause vaginal bleeding. Once an ovarian tumour (B) has spread to the pleural cavity it is by definition a stage IV tumour. Ovarian cancers usually present late because symptoms are often non-specific. This woman needs investigation to rule out ovarian cancer as a matter of urgency. Cancer of the cervix (E) tends to present earlier than ovarian cancer so distant spread is not as common. This patient is most likely to have an ovarian tumour. Meigs’ syndrome (C) is a pleural effusion associated with an ovarian fibroma which is rare. It is benign and classically causes a right-sided pleural effusion.",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 104,
    "topic": "Peri-operative management",
    "explanation": "Patients on long-term steroids prior to surgery are at risk of postoperative shock as a result of secondary corticosteroid insufficiency. Most studies have shown that patients taking less than 10 mg of prednisolone/day (or the equivalent) have a normal hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) response to major surgery and do not need additional steroid cover. However, evidence suggests that those on more than 10 mg/day for 3 months or more prior to surgery require adequate steroid supplementation. For major gynaecological surgery, such as vaginal hysterectomy, 50 mg of hydrocortisone 8-hourly from induction (C) is the standard practice, and may be stopped after 2 or 3 days, or when normal gut function returns and the patient can resume oral steroids. Giving a single dose of steroids and anaesthesia induction (A, B) is unlikely to cover the patient for the increased postoperative demand on the HPA, and cover is necessary until such time as the patient can resume oral steroids. Peri-operative cover for asthma (D) is not routinely employed in surgery. Patients whose asthma is uncontrolled, or who are having a mild asthma attack, would normally have their elective procedure cancelled. Patients should continue to take regular asthma inhalers before and after surgery. Postoperative exacerbations should be managed as for any other non-surgical patient. Respiratory physiotherapy may be useful postoperatively to encourage the use of accessory muscles and full inflation of the lungs and reduce the risk of atelectasis or postoperative respiratory tract infection. Inpatient review by a respiratory physician (E) is not warranted in an otherwise well and well-controlled asthmatic.",

This patient meets the requirement for a diagnosis of SIRS, but in addition there is microbiological evidence of infection with MRSA: this meets the definition of sepsis (A) (SIRS in the presence of a demonstrated pathogen). The fact that she requires intravenous vasopressor support to maintain a cardiac output is evidence of haemodynamic shock, and coupled with sepsis means that the patient is in septic shock (C). Septicaemia (D) is simply the presence of a proven pathogen in the bloodstream. Adult (or acute) respiratory distress syndrome is caused by insult to the lung parenchyma causing impaired gas exchange. There are also systemic effects resulting from associated massive release of inflammatory mediators.",

    "explanation": "Understanding of pelvic anatomy and the course of the ureters is of vital importance if ureteric injury is to be avoided during hysterectomy. The ureters run down the lateral pelvic side walls, along the anterior border of the greater sciatic notch and under the peritoneum. Medial to the obturator nerve, the ureter lies anterior to the internal iliac artery. It enters the pelvis crossing over the iliac vessels at the level of the bifurcation. The ureter passes underneath the uterine artery about 15 mm lateral to the supravaginal cervix (remember ‘water under the bridge’) before coursing towards the urinary bladder. Iatrogenic injury is most common during hysterectomy during ligation of the uterine artery pedicle.",

    "explanation": "Post-menopausal bleeding can be a symptom of ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancer. It is likely that this woman’s post-menopausal bleed is secondary to her stopping HRT. However, it is important that these symptoms are investigated. A pipelle biopsy (A) is invasive and sometimes technically difficult to perform in a post-menopausal woman. A hystero scopy (B) will be necessary if there is a thickened endometrium on ultra sound. Her smear tests (C) are up to date, so repeating this test is unnecessary unless abnormality is seen at speculum examination. Ultrasound (D) would be the investigation of choice. If the endometrium is smooth in outline with a thickness less than 4 mm the woman’s vaginal bleeding is most likely due to withdrawing the HRT. There is no indication for a CT (E) though one would be performed as a staging tool if endometrial cancer were discovered.",

    "explanation": "Laparoscopies are not without risk. Risks include damage to bowel, bladder and blood vessels. Blood vessels can be damaged deep in the pelvis or superficially. When inserting a transverse port the skin should be transilluminated to avoid the superficial epigastric artery (A) that arises from the femoral artery and ascends to the umbilicus. In addition, care is needed to avoid the inferior epigastric artery that runs medial to the obliterated umbilical artery. It begins at the external iliac artery and anastamoses with the superior epigastric artery around the umbilicus. The superior epigastric artery (D) can therefore not be damaged by lateral port insertion. The ilioinguinal (E) and iliohypogastric (C) nerves both originate from L1 and are at risk of damage with lateral port insertion. The ilioinguinal nerve passes through the superficial inguinal ring and provides sensation over the thigh and the labia majora. The external iliac vein (B) originates at the inferior margin of the inguinal ligament and is nowhere near where a lateral port could be placed.",

This presentation is more severe than is often seen; typically children are a bit clumsy and walk with a waddling gait. If the blood test shows a raised CK then he will need a muscle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Until you have established the diagnosis, it would be inappropriate to refer to physiotherapy (C).

He is walking steadily (gross motor), scribbling (fine motor), identifies four body parts (speech and language) and reportedly has several single words – he should have at least 10 words and you have not elicited this from him, but he is not worryingly delayed. This would warrant some follow-up. Likely, his older sister is saying everything for him so he does not have to talk yet. He is feeding himself with a spoon and starting to potty train (social and behavioural). At 12 months (A) he would be walking unsteadily and have 2–3 words; he does more than this. At 15 months (B) he would be scribbling and likely walking well but not managing to feed himself with a spoon. At 2 years (D) you would expect him to build a tower of six blocks and be putting words together.

    "topic": "failure to thrive",
    "explanation": "The answer here is coeliac disease (A). The clue to this is that his growth was normal until the age of weaning, 6 months. With the introduction of gluten into the diet his growth began to falter. You also note he is pale, likely anaemic, suggestive of malnutrition. One of the classic signs of coeliac disease is the wasted buttocks. Neglect (B) should always be considered in any case of failure to thrive, especially in a child who seems withdrawn, but it is important to remember that chronic illness may make children listless and withdrawn and it is always important to rule out physical illness. You would need multidisciplinary input prior to making the diagnosis of neglect. Constitutional delay (C) is the isolated finding of delay in skeletal growth, i.e. height, and is typically seen around the time of puberty; as his growth failure started with weight this answer is incorrect. He is not a normal child (D) as he was born on the 50th centile and his weight is now on the 2nd centile with other parameters following in the traditional pattern of growth failure: weight followed by height, followed by head circumference. Beta thalassaemia (E) is highly unlikely in a Caucasian child.

These infants may present with ambiguous genitalia or bilateral undescended testicles and are at risk of a salt-losing adrenal crisis (vomiting, weight loss, floppy unwell infant), typically around 1–3 weeks of age. It is therefore important to measure urea and electrolytes in addition to chromosomal analysis and a pelvic ultrasound to look for the location of the sex organs. This baby could be a virilized female (D) infant secondary to CAH but the important diagnosis is the underlying cause for the virilization. Undescended testicles (C) are important to identify as they should be followed up to ensure they do descend by 2 years of age. If they remain out of the scrotum they are at increased risk of developing testicular cancer (E) but this would not be a diagnosis found at this stage.

In the context of a wound infection and abdominal striae, many worry that obesity may be Cushing’s syndrome but this would typically present with growth failure and his height is above average (A), which is typical of obesity (C). Cushing syndrome is not caused by steroid inhalers (B) but may be seen in children with severe asthma on oral steroids. While both his height and weight plot on the lines of the centile chart, only 1 per cent of the population of 8 year olds have his weight normally and his height does not match his weight centile, suggesting that he is overweight (D).

    "explanation": "Children with Down’s syndrome do have different growth patterns to other children and should be given special growth charts in their red books, so the correct answer is (C). If the cardiologist has carried out an echocardiogram (A) and discharged the patient, unless there are clinical signs and symptoms to warrant re-referral, this would be a waste of resources and needless worry for the parents. A dietician referral (B) will be needed if she is failing to thrive and continues to have difficulty feeding, but this should be done with investigations for a cause. Parents do shop around to find a milk their child prefers but in the absence of an intolerance the over the counter milks (D) are all equally good and this is unlikely to help. A faster teat (E) may make things worse as Down’s syndrome is associated with low tone and swallowing difficulties, so she may choke if the flow is too fast.",

She is having a severe asthma attack: she is tachycardic and tachypnoeic with circulatory compromise, a prolonged capillary refill time and she has not responded to initial management. Child (A) is unwell with tachycardia, tachypnoea and a slightly prolonged capillary refill time but is pyrexic and has just been given treatment. He should be reviewed in 30 minutes to see that his parameters are improved. Child (C) is at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and should be assessed quickly with a blood gas but she remains alert and orientated with no evidence of circulatory compromise so she is stable enough to remain in general paediatric accident and emergency, but it important to be aware that these patients can get very sick. Patient (D) has a non-blanching rash in the superior vena caval distribution and has normal observations. This is unlikely to be meningococcal sepsis and more likely to be a petechial rash related to the pressure of coughing; however any non-blanching rash should be reviewed by a senior clinician and should be isolated in a side room in accident and emergency. Patient (E) also has the potential to become quite sick but she is currently stable and may need privacy for talks with the mental health team once she is medically cleared; she would benefit from a side room if it is free.",

On examination he is drowsy, has a heart rate of 150, respiratory rate of 60 and a central capillary refill of 5 seconds. He has subcostal recessions and good air entry bilaterally with no added sounds. He moans when you examine his abdomen but there are no masses. You put in a canula and take bloods.

    "explanation": "This child has new-onset, type 1 diabetes; he has been losing weight and the blood gas shows a very high glucose and a metabolic acidosis (remember that in paediatrics, arterial gases are rarely used, and that a venous PO2 will be low; this gas does not show respiratory failure.) The chest is clear on examination and the gas does not show a respiratory acidosis; therefore this is not pneumonia (C). The first management for him is rehydration (B). Only after an hour of rehydration should he be started on intravenous insulin. It is important to correct his dehydration and hyperglycaemia slowly over 2 days due to the risk of brainstem demylination with rapid shifts in salts in the cerebrospinal fluid; therefore (A) is incorrect. Appendicitis (D) or gastroenteritis (E) would be reasonable if the glucose were normal. In the context of a tachycardia with prolonged capillary refill, a patient should be given a fluid bolus and reassessed. Patients should be stabilized before going to the operating theatre.",

Other signs would be fatigue, drowsiness or poor respiratory effort and a peak flow of less than 33 per cent expected (D). Therefore, (B) is incorrect as severe would be a peak flow between 33 and 55 per cent expected. In addition, signs of severe exacerbation include being too breathless to talk or feed, tachycardia and tachypnoea. A blood gas is not part of the guidelines for assessing asthma severity but in this child a worrying gas reading would show a respiratory acidosis, i.e. a rising CO2 suggests that he is unable to maintain the respiratory effort and is therefore failing to clear CO2 leading to a rise in the pH.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is (A): she has presented with a classic presentation of meningococcal sepsis. Do not forget to always give sick children oxygen; if the mask makes them more distressed a minimum of wafted high flow O2 may suffice. The child has a prolonged capillary refill and is tachycardic; she should have a fluid bolus (20 mL/kg) and be reassessed. As soon as intravenous or intraosseous access is obtained she should be given IV ceftriaxone, but only after the blood culture has been taken. (B) and (E) are incorrect as there is no mention of the child having meningitis. Currently there is no formal consensus as to whether steroids should be routinely used but administration before or with the first dose of antibiotics has been shown to be beneficial for some types of bacterial meningitis.

This child presents with anaphylaxis, but did not have early intramuscular adrenaline to prevent the capillary leak of fluid into his airway tissues. Due to oedema his airway is closing off. The rapid shifts in fluid to the interstitium results in intravascular hypovolaemia and shock. This is distributive shock (B). Hypovolaemic shock (A) is due to haemorrhage or dehydration, and the patient would be pale, cool and poorly perfused. In septic shock (C) you would expect a fever and history suggesting infection. In cardiac shock (D) the heart is unable to meet the circulatory demands of the body, resulting in shock. There is chest pain or other cardiac symptoms and this is rare in childhood outside of congenital heart or Kawasaki’s disease. Lastly, obstructive shock (E) is due to blockage of blood flow from the heart, either due to cardiac tamponade, fluid in the pericardial sac compressing the heart or tension pneumothorax.",

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 133,
    "topic": "Overdose",
    "explanation": "The answer is iron overdose (E) which classically is a two phase illness with early vomiting and diarrhoea due to gastric irritation and may present with haematemesis or malaena (the black diarrhoea). There is a period up to 24 hours of improvement and then deterioration with liver failure, drowsiness and coma. The liver failure can produce hypoglycaemia and seizures. The mother has recently had HELLP syndrome, liver failure, thrombocytopenia and hypertension in pregnancy. These patients often have significant haemorrhage and go home on iron supplements. Paracetamol overdose (A) in young children is often not in large doses due to the tablets being difficult to swallow; it may present with gastric irritation or a history that the child took some tablets, liver failure develops on day 3–5, our case presented on day 2 and you would not expect malaena from paracetamol intoxication. Tricyclic antidepressant (C) overdose would present much earlier than 2 days, with tachycardia, anticholinergic symptoms (dry mouth, blurred vision, agitation). Patients become shocked with seizures or coma and develop severe metabolic acidosis and this is one of the few indications for giving intravenous bicarbonate. Bleach intoxication (D) should be thought of as he was in the bathroom playing on his own; however problems are rare as the bleach does not taste nice and typically there will only be localized lesions where the bleach contacted the mucous membranes.",

    "explanation": "All of the answers are correct except for (C) which is the dose of adrenaline for cardiac arrest.

Once the fluid has shifted out of the vascular space, there is no way to rapidly move it out of the tissues; therefore the key first management of anaphylaxis is to administer IM adrenaline. In reality you would put out an emergency call for an anaesthetist (E) to manage the rapidly closing airway, give further salbutamol nebulizers and gain intravenous access to give hydrocortisone and antihistamine. Give (A) to block the histamine release which is driving the capillary leak and (B) to reduce general inflammation and aim to prevent the late type IV hypersensitivity.

    "question": "A term baby is awaiting his discharge check when you are called to see him at 10 hours of age. His mother reports that he has turned a dusky colour and is not as alert as he has been. On examination he has central cyanosis, pulse 150 bpm regular, and both brachial and femoral pulses are palpable. He has normal heart sounds with no murmur. His oxygen saturations are 65 per cent in air. What is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transposition of the great vessels",
      "B. Ventricular septal defect (VSD)",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 149,
    "topic": "Cyanotic baby",
    "explanation": "This child has a cyanotic defect affecting the oxygenation of the blood. Transposition of the great vessels (whereby the aorta is attached to the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery attached to the left ventricle) (A) and the Tetralogy of Fallot (multiple defects including VSD, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy and overriding aorta) (C) are both cyanotic presentations but the Tetralogy of Fallot more commonly presents at around 6 months of age with cyanotic spells. Transposition of the great vessels is more likely to present at birth and is only compatible with life if there is a mixing defect in addition (VSD, atrial septal defect, persistent ductus arteriorus). In this child the ductus arteriosus helps to shunt blood to the lungs until it starts to close physiologically. He then is at risk of worsening cyanosis. He needs a prostaglandin infusion to keep the duct open and surgical intervention. The other answer options (B) (VSD is a communication between the left and right ventricles allowing left-to-right shunting), (D) (narrowing of the outflow tract of the left ventricle) and (E) (narrowing of a section of the aorta) are acyanotic and therefore do not account for this presentation.",

    "explanation": "Infants of diabetic mothers are at risk of congenital malformations (if glucose control was poor around conception) and hypoglycaemia and macrosomia in the post-natal period. They become used to having high levels of circulating glucose from their mother and therefore increase their baseline insulin production. At delivery, this supply of glucose is removed and the residual insulin will decrease their glucose, predisposing to hypoglycaemia, so (B) is correct. Fits can occur in babies secondary to infection (C), or electrolyte disturbances (A), (D) and (E) but in this case (B) is more likely given the mother’s history, though all should be considered after.",

This is caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle at the gastric outlet leading to delayed stomach emptying and gradually increased vomiting. These children are often hungry after the vomit. A volvulus (B) and intussusception (D) would have significant irritability, abdominal distension and tenderness associated with them, in addition to vomiting. NEC (C) is predominately an illness of the premature infant presenting with abdominal distension and bile stained gastric aspirates. When it occurs in term infants there is usually a history of birth asphyxia or severe growth restriction. Gastroenteritis (A) can occur in young infants especially if parents are not using sterilized (boiled and cooled) water to make up formula.

Children usually present after weaning and exposure to wheat, with diarrhoea, abdominal distension, failure to thrive and wasting, especially of the buttocks. There is often a family history of autoimmune disease such as thyroid disease or diabetes. Crohn’s disease (A) and ulcerative colitis (B) are rare in paediatrics outside of teenagers. Irritable bowel syndrome (D) would be unusual in such a young child but is associated with abdominal pain and bloating with altered bowel habit, including diarrhoea or constipation. It is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion and while weight loss can be seen if the child eats less to avoid symptoms, it is a less prominent presenting feature. Lastly, giardiasis (E) could easily present like this in a young child; however you would expect a travel history to an endemic area or other family members to be unwell having drunk contaminated water.

    "topic": "Abdominal examination",
    "explanation": "He is presenting with signs of chronic liver failure, clubbing and palmar erythema. While he does have spider naevi you need at least five to be significant. Slit lamp examination of his eyes revealed Kayser–Fleischer rings which are a sign of Wilson’s disease (C). This is an autosomal recessive defect in copper metabolism that results in copper deposition in the tissues and leads to liver failure with cirrhosis, neurological sequelae, renal involvement and cardiac complications. In addition patients develop haemolytic anaemia due to copper deposits in the red cell membrane. Thus, as he has a palpable liver and spleen, he is anaemic and complaining of upper abdominal pain with stigmata of liver failure, the most likely diagnosis is Wilson’s disease (C). Abdominal tuberculosis (A) is part of the differential diagnosis, but is unlikely to cause such significant signs of hepatic dysfunction, and would not explain the eye findings. Cystic fibrosis (B) may cause clubbing, but you have been given no pulmonary information, making this diagnosis unlikely. Acute hepatitis A (D) would not produce signs of chronic liver failure and normally presents with vomiting and possible jaundice. There is often a palpable liver but splenic enlargement would be unusual. Similarly, glandular fever (usually caused by infection with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)), would not produce signs of chronic liver failure on examination, but the child may give a history of lethargy and have a palpable liver and spleen. Again, the eye findings would not be explained by EBV infection.",

There are no red flags present in the history such as growth failure, a history of delayed passage of meconium, distended abdomen with vomiting, anal pathology or neurological complications affecting the lower limbs. The correct first line management would be advice on increased fluid/fibre intake and exercise (A). Once her stools are softer, behavioural change management around toileting using star charts will help her overcome the toilet avoidance (B). If lifestyle changes do not produce softer stools or she develops vomiting, she may need medical bowel disimpaction with non-stimulant laxatives (D) but this would not be first line management. Stimulant laxatives (E) should not be used as they may produce more abdominal pain, dependence and have an associated risk of bowel perforation. Referral to the surgeons for bowel disimpaction under anaesthesia would be a last resort after failed medical management and underlying causes of constipation have been ruled out or treated.

    "explanation": "On examination you can feel a swelling in the groin which is associated with a tense abdomen. In a vomiting baby this is an incarcerated inguinal hernia (B) and needs to be seen urgently by the surgeons to go to theatre. Appendicitis (A) is common in childhood, most commonly seen between the ages of 11 and 20 years old. However, it is very unusual in the infant as the neck of the appendix is wide and unlikely to obstruct at this age. Gastroenteritis (C) can occur in young infants, especially if parents are not using sterilized (boiled and cooled) water to make up formula. It normally presents with a short history of vomiting and diarrhoea in an unwell infant, and there may be a contact history such as another family member with diarrhea or vomiting. NEC (D) is predominately an illness of the premature infant presenting with abdominal distension and bile stained nasogastric aspirates. When it occurs in term infants there is usually a history of birth asphyxia or severe growth restriction. In the absence of localizing signs to the abdomen in a child this young you would treat with IV antibiotics to cover neonatal sepsis (E) but this does not explain the swelling in the groin.

Pneumonia in the lower lobes (A) may present as pain in the upper abdomen and fever. Any upper or lower respiratory tract infection in young children can be associated with vomiting, mostly because of inflamed upper airways triggering the gag reflex and increased work of breathing putting pressure on the stomach just below the diaphragm. Mesenteric adenitis (B) is the most likely answer as this is classically how mesenteric adenitis presents, although it is a diagnosis of exclusion, having ruled out other pathology. There is often a preceding viral illness (typically either upper respiratory or gastroenteritis). Enlarged mesenteric glands can be seen on abdominal ultrasound examination. Mesenteric adenitis may be mistaken for appendicitis. While it is unusual for such a young child to develop diabetes (C), even babies can. Infection is often a trigger for new onset or an episode of ketoacidosis in a known diabetic, and this may present with vomiting. Pyelonephritis (D) should always be ruled out in a child with fever and vomiting unless a clear alternative source of infection is identified.",

    "explanation": "Often the first presentation of migraine in children is abdominal pain, in the context of a family history of migraine. This diagnosis would not be supported if the child has per rectum bleeding (E). The most common cause of PR bleeding in children is constipation with an anal fissure and this would produce bright red blood on the toilet tissue or streaked on the surface of the stool (A). Intussusception has a late and uncommon sign of ‘redcurrant jelly’ stool (B) which is due to blood and mucus from the distal end of the invaginated segment of bowel becoming necrotic. At this stage there is a risk of perforation, especially if insufflation is attempted. The diagnosis should ideally be made long before these signs evolve. Two per cent of the population have a Meckel’s diverticulum, an ileal remnant of the vitellointestinal duct which contains ectopic gastric mucosa and can lead to ulceration, perforation and a presentation with severe rectal haemorrhage of dark red blood (C). Bacterial gastroenteritis with Shigella or Salmonella may produce blood and/or pus mixed into the stool (D).",

    "question": "A mother brings her 2 year old to see you. She is very worried that he always has diarrhoea or loose stools. He eats a normal diet, and no particular foods seem to upset him but he often still has bits of vegetables or food he has eaten visible in the stool. She thinks he is losing weight and he is starting to potty train, so she is concerned this will affect his ability to anticipate needing the toilet. On examination he is an alert and well-looking child with a normal capillary refill, heart and respiratory rate. His abdomen is soft with no masses, there is no evidence of wasting and his weight and height are following the 50th centile. What is the most appropriate management?",

    "answer": "A",

    "topic": "Diarrhoea",
    "explanation": "This is toddler’s diarrhoea which is a common cause of loose stool in pre-school aged children and almost always requires no treatment (A). It is likely to be related to immature development of intestinal motility and it resolves in most children by the age of 5. Rarely, if the diarrhoea is socially disruptive to the child, it can be treated with loperamide (B), but he is only just starting to potty train and should be given a chance to do so. ‘Significant social disruption’ would be considered if he has failed to potty train and was unable to start school. He is a well-grown child with no evidence of wasting, so coeliac disease (C) is unlikely and the first investigation for this would be a blood test for anti-endomesial antibodies, not endoscopy. Inflammatory bowel disease (D) would be rare in a child this young, and there is no mention of abdominal pain, passage of blood and mucus or any suggestion of growth failure. While diarrhoea is a common symptom of hyperthyroidism (E), it is more commonly seen in female teenagers or in the neonatal period in infants born to mothers with Graves’ disease. He is growing normally and has no other features of hyperthyroidism such as restlessness, increased appetite, sweating or tachycardia.",

    "explanation": "Ulcerative colitis (A) can affect any age but is rare in early childhood and increases in incidence with age. It is a recurrent inflammatory ulcerating disease of the mucous membrane layer of the rectum which spreads proximally to involve the colon. It classically presents with abdominal pain with blood or mucus mixed into diarrhoea. It is associated with erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, arthritis and spondylitis, which may explain his back and knee pain. Crohn’s disease (B) can be difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis but it is not commonly associated with spondylitis suggested by the back pain. The main distinction is on histology with Crohn’s disease showing non-caseating granuloma and full thickness lesions. Coeliac disease (C) usually presents with malnutrition and abdominal bloating. Diarrhoea may be a presenting feature but blood would be unusual and would be digested, i.e. dark stools.

The most common cause of delayed meconium passage is (E), which is a transient immaturity of the gut resulting in failure to move a plug of meconium along. The management is with anal stimulation with a glycerine chip. Approximately 20 per cent of cystic fibrosis cases will present with a meconium ileus (B) due to inspissated meconium. Approximately one in 4000 babies will have Hirschprung’s disease (A) which is caused by the absence of ganglion cells from the myenteric and submucosal plexi in part of the rectum or colon which results in narrowed bowel in the denervated region. The lack of bowel wall movement fails to move the meconium along. The management is surgical resection of the denervated portion of bowel. An imperforate anus (D) is slightly less common than Hirschprung’s disease, and will require surgical intervention.",

    "page": 160,
    "topic": "Chronic vomiting and diarrhoea",
    "explanation": "In light of the eczema that has developed since breastfeeding cessation, plus the nappy rash and anal inflammation, the most likely explanation is cow’s milk protein intolerance (A), an allergic reaction to the cow’s milk proteins, which is different from lactose intolerance (B). Cow’s milk protein intolerance typically presents with exposure to cow’s milk in infancy, although in severe cases maternal ingestion of dairy products may affect a breastfeeding infant. The infant has worsening skin inflammation (eczema), vomiting, diarrhoea (which may be bloody), failure to thrive, irritability and colic. Lactose intolerance (B) is typically acquired following acute gastroenteritis. It is unusual in infancy, although rarely it can be congenital. It is a deficiency in the enzyme, lactose dehydrogenase, which breaks down lactose (the disaccharide sugar in milk). The build up of sugars in the gut results in an osmotic diarrhoea and dehydration. This history is too long for gastroenteritis (C) which could be associated with the introduction of bottle feeds if the equipment and water has not been sterilized. Hyper IgE syndrome (D), sometimes referred to as Job’s syndrome, is an autosomal dominant immunodeficiency which is associated with severe eczema and skin boils but does not have significant gastrointestinal presentations. Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (E) is also associated with eczema. This is an X-linked recessive disorder associated with thrombocytopenia, eczema and lymphopenia, but no significant gastrointestinal symptoms.",

According to his symptoms he has life-threatening asthma, but initial management still requires the use of back to back salbutamol nebulizers (D). He is hypoxic in room air, so giving oxygen driven nebulizers will be of benefit compared to inhalers or oxygen alone (B). If after three doses of salbutamol and one of Atrovent nebulizer he is not improving, he may require IV salbutamol or aminophylline and magnesium sulphate, but not first line (C). Although he does require high flow oxygen, this alone will not help the underlying problem. If he is not responding to intravenous therapy then intubation and ventilation will be required with intensive care support (A).

It occurs in premature babies as a consequence of barotraumas or volutrauma during the ventilation, surfactant deficiency and oxygen therapy, though the pathophysiology is complex. It can be minimized by using the lowest possible pressure and volume settings to optimize respiratory function in premature infants, but despite this there can be long-term consequences. These children are at risk of respiratory tract infections, particularly RSV for which the preventative paluvizumab monocloncal antibody can be given. (A) Respiratory distress syndrome is due to surfactant deficiency and may be present soon after birth; however, if the clinical manifestations persist, these children may also develop chronic lung disease.

He has recently started to cruise around furniture, but is not yet walking. His crying has been worse today and both his parents had been awake all night due to his incessant crying. On examining the baby, you note that he is more upset when being handled and is a bit better when lying on his front.

The baby may be inconsolable, particularly after feeding, if he has symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. It may be inferred that the parents in their fatigue and frustration may be responsible for the injuries. If you suspect NAI, then a detailed history and examination are needed, discussion with a senior paediatrician and social services to fully investigate the situation to safeguard the child (E) while (D) is not a safe protocol to follow.

It is based on the premise that abnormal cells can be detected early, well before they undergo malignant change and appropriate treatment can be instituted to prevent progression to invasive disease. Women in the UK are first invited for cervical screening at 25 years of age and then every 3 years until 50, whereafter they are screened every 5 years. The programme ends when they are 65 years of age unless abnormal results have been shown. Mild dyskaryosis detected on one sample should prompt a repeat smear within 3 months. A second sample reported as mild dyskaryosis warrants referral for colposcopy (C). Knife cone biopsy (D) and loop excision (E) are normally performed only after a histological rather than cytological diagnosis of dyskaryosis. Referral for colposcopy should also be made after three consecutive borderline results at LBC, after two results of mild dyskaryosis, or when there is any moderate or severe dyskaryosis.",

In this patient, the combination of the haemoglobin drop and increasing abdominal distension, alongside the umbilical pain, points towards an umbilical port site bleed. Where there is evidence of continuing blood loss, as in this case, resuscitation followed by reoperation (E) is the most appropriate management. Her paleness and shortness of breath are probably due to blood loss. Volume replacement (B) and blood transfusion (A) are appropriate management methods but they are ‘holding options’ and by no means definitive in correcting continuing surgical bleeding. Although abdominal distension may point to obstruction, requiring a nasogastric tube (D), in this situation and in the absence of vomiting it is an unlikely diagnosis. CTPA (C) to exclude pulmonary embolism is not indicated in the absence of other more specific signs pointing towards this diagnosis, and D-dimer would be raised after surgery anyway.",

    "explanation": "This woman is clearly very unwell with a profound alkalosis. As there is a low PCO2 as well as a raised bicarbonate, there is a mixed acid-base disturbance (E). In a purely metabolic alkalosis (A) the PCO2 should be higher, whereas with a pure respiratory alkalosis (B) one would expect a much lower compensatory bicarbonate, given that the respiratory alkalosis is likely to have been chronic. This is therefore a mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis (E). In this case, the respiratory alkalosis is most probably due to a high respiratory rate due to the significant acute pneumonia while the metabolic alkalosis is most probably due to the hypokalaemia (potassium 1.9 mmol/L), in turn caused by her repeated vomiting of potassium-rich gastric contents secondary to hyperemesis gravidarum. Answer (D) is a distractor which most candidates can easily dismiss: respiratory alkalosis is marked by low PCO2 due to an increased respiratory effort ‘blowing off’ the carbon dioxide, and a respiratory compensation would mean the patient had reduced but not normalized their respiratory rate. All respiratory alkaloses therefore have ‘inadequate respiratory compensation’!",

The recovery time is much quicker compared to a laparotomy. For this reason answer (C) would be most appropriate. Subtotal hysterectomy (D) is inappropriate since not removing the cervix may inadvertently leave some malignant endometrial tissue.

    "explanation": "The diagnosis and management of ovarian cancers is principally surgical. A full work-up for women undergoing evaluation for ovarian cancer includes CT of the abdomen. This may, as in the case here, reveal extra-abdominopelvic disease which is classified as stage IV (metastatic) ovarian cancer. However, imaging does not replace the need for histological diagnosis at operation. A staging laparotomy establishes the type and extent of the primary cancer and allows optimal cytoreduction (or ‘debulking surgery’) (C) where as much of the disease as possible is removed at operation. Even in advanced cancers, the preferred treatment for all women who are fit for operation is optimal cytoreductive surgery. Chemotherapy may also be indicated since ovarian cancers are highly sensitive to platinum based agents and the vinca alkaloids. Indeed, many centres now pre-empt debulking surgery with chemotherapy (so-called interval debulking procedures). In an otherwise fit woman of 65 years, offering no active treatment for a disease (D) which can be effectively managed is inappropriate, unless the patient expressly wishes it. Total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy are often employed during surgery for early ovarian cancers. However, performing radiotherapy of another organ system (A) at the same time as radical surgery has significant risk attached. Aortopelvic lymphadenopathy (B) is not widely used given that it does not increase 5-year survival and is associated with operative risk.",

    "page": 103,
    "topic": "Pleural effusion",
    "explanation": "This woman is unwell as a result of the pleural effusion and ascites. All of the options can cause ascites and pleural effusions. The high protein content of the ascitic fluid suggests an inflammatory or malignant cause rather than CCF (A) or cirrhosis of the liver (D). CCF involves both left and right ventricular failure. Left ventricular failure will lead to pulmonary oedema while right-sided failure leads to hepatomegaly, ascites and peripheral oedema. Cirrhosis of the liver is characterised by ascites and hepatomegaly. Other complications may include oesophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy. The history of decreased appetite and vaginal bleeding raises the possibility of an advanced gynaecological cancer with metastatic spread outside the abdomen – (B) or (E). CCF (A) and hepatic cirrhosis (D) do not cause vaginal bleeding. Once an ovarian tumour (B) has spread to the pleural cavity it is by definition a stage IV tumour. Ovarian cancers usually present late because symptoms are often non-specific. This woman needs investigation to rule out ovarian cancer as a matter of urgency. Cancer of the cervix (E) tends to present earlier than ovarian cancer so distant spread is not as common. This patient is most likely to have an ovarian tumour.

    "page": 104,
    "topic": "Peri-operative management",
    "explanation": "Patients on long-term steroids prior to surgery are at risk of postoperative shock as a result of secondary corticosteroid insufficiency. Most studies have shown that patients taking less than 10 mg of prednisolone/day (or the equivalent) have a normal hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) response to major surgery and do not need additional steroid cover. However, evidence suggests that those on more than 10 mg/day for 3 months or more prior to surgery require adequate steroid supplementation. For major gynaecological surgery, such as vaginal hysterectomy, 50 mg of hydrocortisone 8-hourly from induction (C) is the standard practice, and may be stopped after 2 or 3 days, or when normal gut function returns and the patient can resume oral steroids. Giving a single dose of steroids and anaesthesia induction (A, B) is unlikely to cover the patient for the increased postoperative demand on the HPA, and cover is necessary until such time as the patient can resume oral steroids. Peri-operative cover for asthma (D) is not routinely employed in surgery. Patients whose asthma is uncontrolled, or who are having a mild asthma attack, would normally have their elective procedure cancelled. Patients should continue to take regular asthma inhalers before and after surgery. Postoperative exacerbations should be managed as for any other non-surgical patient. Respiratory physiotherapy may be useful postoperatively to encourage the use of accessory muscles and full inflation of the lungs and reduce the risk of atelectasis or postoperative respiratory tract infection. Inpatient review by a respiratory physician (E) is not warranted in an otherwise well and well-controlled asthmatic.",

    "explanation": "Damage to the perineal nerve (A), which is a branch of the pudendal nerve, can cause localized loss of sensation of parts of the labia (usually anterior) and perineum. Damage to the pudendal nerve (C) itself would likely cause much more extensive sensory loss over the entire perineum, perianal skin and some of the labia. The dorsal nerve of the clitoris (D) and inferior anal nerves (E) are similarly branches of the pudendal nerve and supply part of the clitoris and the anal skin and external anal sphincter, respectively. The peroneal nerve (B) is a distractor which should be easily dismissed. Also referred to as the common fibular nerve, it originates from the sacral plexus (L4–S3) and innervates the anterior and lateral compartments of the lower leg.",

    "question": "A 54-year-old woman with a history of significant ischaemic heart disease undergoes vaginal hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine prolapse. She develops significant surgical site bleeding which is repaired at reoperation the same day. Her postoperative haemoglobin is 6.4 g/dL. Later the same day she develops chest pain.

In the presence of such a profound anaemia, the myocardium will be sufficiently deprived of oxygen that chest pain can develop, even if this is not significant enough to cause frank infarction (A). Myocardial infarction is very unlikely in the presence of normal troponin-I and a normal ECG. Pulmonary embolism (C) is a possible differential diagnosis, although this woman is on thromboprophylaxis. Atelectasis (D) would typically occur some time later, after surgery, usually after 48 hours. Similarly, this would be a very rapid onset for sepsis (E) and an unusual presentation in the absence of fever.",

In a fit 46 year old, significant blood loss is required to invoke a response of tachycardia, hypotension and reduced urine output. The concerns of a senior nurse should always be treated seriously. Although a fluid challenge (B, E) may help to stabilize the patient, it is not definitive management. Similarly, arterial blood sampling (C) and haemoglobin measurement (which may be estimated on an arterial blood gas machine) may assist diagnosis but in this case they should be performed concurrently with definitive, life-saving actions. The only response which combines these two is (A). This woman needs returning to the operating theatre, where even if surgery does not take place, invasive monitoring and aggressive resuscitation facilities, as well as anaesthetists, are more readily on hand.

A second pouch, the vesicouterine pouch (A), lies between the anterior surface of the lower uterine body and the posterior surface of the bladder. The vesicouterine fold is dissected off the anterior wall of the uterus at caesarean section to deflect the bladder inferiorly and reduce the likelihood of iatrogenic bladder damage when incising the uterus. The pararectal fossa (D) is formed by lateral reflections of the peritoneum over the superior third of the rectum. The rectovesical fossa (E) does not exist in the normal female pelvis as the bladder and rectum are separated anatomically by the uterus. The paravesical fossa (B) is formed by the anterior pelvic wall peritoneum covering the superior surface of the bladder; either side of this is a depression that is termed the paravesical fossa.",

    "explanation": "Ovarian cysts in post-menopausal women may be managed conservatively if they meet certain criteria. A risk of malignancy can be calculated using the CA 125 value, the characteristics of the cyst on ultrasound and the menopause status. The concerning ultrasound features include the presence of bilateral cysts, multiloculated cysts, cysts with solid components, ascites and metastases. The score is calculated as one point for every ultrasound feature (0 to 5) multiplied by the CA 125. This is then multiplied by three if they are post-menopausal. Thus, with two features on ultrasound, RMI = 2 × 120 × 3, which is 720. RMI <50 has a 3 per cent chance of cancer. RMI between 50 and 250 has a 20 per cent chance of cancer and an RMI >250 has a 75 per cent chance of cancer. This woman should be referred to a specialist cancer unit for work-up and surgery.",

If the woman does have an infection such as chlamydia, early treatment can prevent the long-term sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease, including subfertility. As she is only 21, it is unlikely this woman will have had a cervical smear test (B). However, as she is sexually active it would be prudent to perform a cervical smear as well. There is no need to perform biopsy of the endometrium (A) yet, given the short duration of her symptoms.

This patient meets the requirement for a diagnosis of SIRS, but in addition there is microbiological evidence of infection with MRSA: this meets the definition of sepsis (A) (SIRS in the presence of a demonstrated pathogen). The fact that she requires intravenous vasopressor support to maintain a cardiac output is evidence of haemodynamic shock, and coupled with sepsis means that the patient is in septic shock (C). Septicaemia (D) is simply the presence of a proven pathogen in the bloodstream. Adult (or acute) respiratory distress syndrome is caused by insult to the lung parenchyma causing impaired gas exchange.

The ureters run down the lateral pelvic side walls, along the anterior border of the greater sciatic notch and under the peritoneum. Medial to the obturator nerve, the ureter lies anterior to the internal iliac artery. It enters the pelvis crossing over the iliac vessels at the level of the bifurcation.

A hystero scopy (B) will be necessary if there is a thickened endometrium on ultra sound. Her smear tests (C) are up to date, so repeating this test is unnecessary unless abnormality is seen at speculum examination. Ultrasound (D) would be the investigation of choice.

When inserting a transverse port the skin should be transilluminated to avoid the superficial epigastric artery (A) that arises from the femoral artery and ascends to the umbilicus. In addition, care is needed to avoid the inferior epigastric artery that runs medial to the obliterated umbilical artery. It begins at the external iliac artery and anastamoses with the superior epigastric artery around the umbilicus. The superior epigastric artery (D) can therefore not be damaged by lateral port insertion. The ilioinguinal (E) and iliohypogastric (C) nerves both originate from L1 and are at risk of damage with lateral port insertion. The ilioinguinal nerve passes through the superficial inguinal ring and provides sensation over the thigh and the labia majora.

    "explanation": "The answer here is coeliac disease (A). The clue to this is that his growth was normal until the age of weaning, 6 months. With the introduction of gluten into the diet his growth began to falter. You also note he is pale, likely anaemic, suggestive of malnutrition. One of the classic signs of coeliac disease is the wasted buttocks. Neglect (B) should always be considered in any case of failure to thrive, especially in a child who seems withdrawn, but it is important to remember that chronic illness may make children listless and withdrawn and it is always important to rule out physical illness. You would need multidisciplinary input prior to making the diagnosis of neglect. Constitutional delay (C) is the isolated finding of delay in skeletal growth, i.e. height, and is typically seen around the time of puberty; as his growth failure started with weight this answer is incorrect. He is not a normal child (D) as he was born on the 50th centile and his weight is now on the 2nd centile with other parameters following in the traditional pattern of growth failure: weight followed by height, followed by head circumference. Beta thalassaemia (E) is highly unlikely in a Caucasian child.

    "question": "A 12-year-old boy presents to his GP with left-sided unilateral breast development stage III. He is very upset as he is being bullied at school. His mother is worried as her friend’s sister has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and wants to know if he could have breast cancer? What is the management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Refer for a breast ultrasound",
      "B. Test sex hormone levels",
      "C. Test alpha fetoprotein",
      "D. Reassure and explain this is a normal part of puberty; it will resolve but the other breast may enlarge transiently as well",

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 121,
    "topic": "Puberty",
    "explanation": "This is a common presentation for adolescent males and the correct answer is to reassure (D). Normal puberty for boys starts between 9 and 13 years old with increasing testicular volume above 4 mL. This is followed by penis enlargement, pubic hair growth and lastly the growth spurt. It is not uncommon for boys to develop transient gynaecomastia during puberty. He does not need investigation (A, B, C or E) or intervention, unless the problem does not resolve.",

On examination you are unable to palpate the testicles on ether side and do not feel any lumps in the groin area. He has a normal penis with no hypospadias and the anus is patent. He is otherwise a normal baby on examination. What is the most important diagnosis to rule out?",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 121,
    "topic": "Neonatal examination",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) (B), which is most commonly due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. These infants may present with ambiguous genitalia or bilateral undescended testicles and are at risk of a salt-losing adrenal crisis (vomiting, weight loss, floppy unwell infant), typically around 1–3 weeks of age. It is therefore important to measure urea and electrolytes in addition to chromosomal analysis and a pelvic ultrasound to look for the location of the sex organs. This baby could be a virilized female (D) infant secondary to CAH but the important diagnosis is the underlying cause for the virilization. Undescended testicles (C) are important to identify as they should be followed up to ensure they do descend by 2 years of age. If they remain out of the scrotum they are at increased risk of developing testicular cancer (E) but this would not be a diagnosis found at this stage. Klinefelter’s syndrome (A) has a karyotype 47XXY and typically presents as tall stature, delayed puberty and possibly mild learning difficulties but not undescended testicles.",

    "explanation": "This child is obese (C). He should be advised to continue exercise, such as bike riding, and make healthy choices for his diet, such as eating fruit rather than potato chips for snacks. Children should not be put on diets under normal circumstances as a normal healthy diet with regular exercise will improve his weight as he grows. In the context of a wound infection and abdominal striae, many worry that obesity may be Cushing’s syndrome but this would typically present with growth failure and his height is above average (A), which is typical of obesity (C). Cushing syndrome is not caused by steroid inhalers (B) but may be seen in children with severe asthma on oral steroids. While both his height and weight plot on the lines of the centile chart, only 1 per cent of the population of 8 year olds have his weight normally and his height does not match his weight centile, suggesting that he is overweight (D). The mild gynaecomastia is unlikely to be made of breast tissue and is more likely to be fat pads as he is active riding bikes. It is unlikely that he is unwell enough to be in liver failure despite possibly having gynaecomastia (E).",

    "explanation": "This is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (C). It classically runs in families in the male line and presents with delayed puberty and growth spurt. He has started puberty and it seems to be progressing in the normal pattern so he should be reassured that he will get his growth spurt as he finishes puberty. While 9 per cent of the population will have his height and weight (A) and be normal, the mid-parental height suggests he should be taller than he is (the mean parental height plus 7 cm for boys or minus 7 cm for girls predicts the adult height of the child ± two standard deviations). As he has started puberty and is otherwise well this is unlikely to be growth hormone deficiency (B) or underlying chronic illness (D). In anorexia (E) you would expect the weight to be less than the height centile and to be more extremely low.",

She does not know how to make her listen and is worried that she is going to get hurt. Yesterday she ran ahead and did not stop when her mother called to her. She ran into the street and was hit by a cyclist, but fortunately he was OK and Stacey had only had a few cuts and scrapes and seems alright! On questioning you hear other stories of a naughty child. She is active and eats well, feeding herself a lot now, but her mother does say she gets frequent coughs and colds.

She is feeding herself and running which is appropriate for a 2 year old but she is only talking at about a year-and-a-half’s age level and she is difficult to understand. This, along with a story of poor attentiveness in a child, raises concerns of hearing problems. The most common cause would be glue ear associated with recurrent coughs and colds and she should have a hearing test (D). She does not need any blood tests (B) as all children at this age have recurrent coughs and colds, the average being eight illnesses a year. Only recurrent severe infections warrant investigation for immune deficiency. The routine childhood vaccinations cover her for tetanus (C); unless her records say she has not had them she does not need a booster, and she will have the pre-school booster and one when she is a teenager. Answer (E) will not change Stacey’s behaviour; young children respond to positive and negative reinforcement techniques to modify behaviour.",

    "question": "An older mother books in to see you after attending the health visitor for a weight check at 2 months for her first child. She and her husband have had a hard time coming to terms with their daughter’s diagnosis of Down’s syndrome. She is relieved that the appointment with the cardiologists went well and the heart is normal. However they have a lot of trouble getting her to take the whole bottle, she was slow to regain her birth weight and looking at the plotted weight yesterday she is not growing along her birth centile and the mother is worried she is not doing a good enough job. She is not vomiting except for small possets after feeds, is passing urine and opening her bowels. The red book growth chart shows the weight to be falling off centiles. What is the most appropriate management?",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 123,
    "topic": "Down’s syndrome",
    "explanation": "Children with Down’s syndrome do have different growth patterns to other children and should be given special growth charts in their red books, so the correct answer is (C). If the cardiologist has carried out an echocardiogram (A) and discharged the patient, unless there are clinical signs and symptoms to warrant re-referral, this would be a waste of resources and needless worry for the parents. A dietician referral (B) will be needed if she is failing to thrive and continues to have difficulty feeding, but this should be done with investigations for a cause. Parents do shop around to find a milk their child prefers but in the absence of an intolerance the over the counter milks (D) are all equally good and this is unlikely to help. A faster teat (E) may make things worse as Down’s syndrome is associated with low tone and swallowing difficulties, so she may choke if the flow is too fast.",

Child (A) is unwell with tachycardia, tachypnoea and a slightly prolonged capillary refill time but is pyrexic and has just been given treatment. He should be reviewed in 30 minutes to see that his parameters are improved. Child (C) is at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and should be assessed quickly with a blood gas but she remains alert and orientated with no evidence of circulatory compromise so she is stable enough to remain in general paediatric accident and emergency, but it important to be aware that these patients can get very sick. Patient (D) has a non-blanching rash in the superior vena caval distribution and has normal observations. This is unlikely to be meningococcal sepsis and more likely to be a petechial rash related to the pressure of coughing; however any non-blanching rash should be reviewed by a senior clinician and should be isolated in a side room in accident and emergency. Patient (E) also has the potential to become quite sick but she is currently stable and may need privacy for talks with the mental health team once she is medically cleared; she would benefit from a side room if it is free.",

The chest is clear on examination and the gas does not show a respiratory acidosis; therefore this is not pneumonia (C). The first management for him is rehydration (B). Only after an hour of rehydration should he be started on intravenous insulin. It is important to correct his dehydration and hyperglycaemia slowly over 2 days due to the risk of brainstem demylination with rapid shifts in salts in the cerebrospinal fluid; therefore (A) is incorrect. Appendicitis (D) or gastroenteritis (E) would be reasonable if the glucose were normal.

In addition, signs of severe exacerbation include being too breathless to talk or feed, tachycardia and tachypnoea. A blood gas is not part of the guidelines for assessing asthma severity but in this child a worrying gas reading would show a respiratory acidosis, i.e. a rising CO2 suggests that he is unable to maintain the respiratory effort and is therefore failing to clear CO2 leading to a rise in the pH.

In cardiac shock (D) the heart is unable to meet the circulatory demands of the body, resulting in shock. There is chest pain or other cardiac symptoms and this is rare in childhood outside of congenital heart or Kawasaki’s disease. Lastly, obstructive shock (E) is due to blockage of blood flow from the heart, either due to cardiac tamponade, fluid in the pericardial sac compressing the heart or tension pneumothorax.",

While you are taking a history from the mother, you notice the baby has gone blue again and seems to be unconscious in her arms. You call for help and place the baby on the examination table. There is no obvious work of breathing. The nurses bring the crash trolley and give you a bag valve mask, which they are connecting to the oxygen. You give two inflation breaths but do not see the chest rise. You reposition the air way and this time the breaths go in. You feel for a pulse and there is none. When asked to do CPR the nurse asks for direction on how many breaths and compressions you both need to do.",

His mother reports it starting 30 minutes ago in his right arm and quickly became generalized tonic clonic jerking. She gave him his buccal midazolam after the first 5 minutes and called an ambulance when he did not respond after another 5 minutes. The ambulance crew gave him rectal diazepam on arrival at 15 minutes into the seizure. He is receiving high flow oxygen via a face mask and continues to convulse. The mother tells you that he was weaned from his long-term seizure medication, phenytoin, 2 weeks ago and that he has had a cold for the past 2 days. What is the next step in management?",

Due to the risk of respiratory depression further doses of barbituates ((A) or (C)) should be avoided. It should be noted that many text books still recommend the use of per rectum peraldehyde if two doses of barbituates fail; however this is now not routinely used in management of status epilepticus due to significant rates of drug errors such as IV rather than rectal administration. If his epilepsy was currently managed by phenytoin he should be given intravenous phenobarbital (E) but he was recently taken off of it. Intravenous ceftriaxone (B) may be indicated in a situation of status epilepticus associated with fever as encephalitis may present with seizures, but it is not the next step in management.",

Harry is normally fit and well with no significant past medical history or allergies. He is up to date with his immunizations and has been growing and developing normally. His behaviour has been difficult for the past 2 weeks since the birth of his little sister. Mum has been unwell as she developed HELLP syndrome and was in hospital for a week following the delivery. Yesterday, he was quite unwell with a tummy bug, vomiting and had black diarrhoea. That evening they found a mess he had made in the bathroom with all of his mum’s things strewn over the floor including her tablets from the hospital. By that time, Harry was getting better so they did not think anything of it.

      "E. Iron overdose"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 133,
    "topic": "Overdose",
    "explanation": "The answer is iron overdose (E) which classically is a two phase illness with early vomiting and diarrhoea due to gastric irritation and may present with haematemesis or malaena (the black diarrhoea). There is a period up to 24 hours of improvement and then deterioration with liver failure, drowsiness and coma. The liver failure can produce hypoglycaemia and seizures. The mother has recently had HELLP syndrome, liver failure, thrombocytopenia and hypertension in pregnancy. These patients often have significant haemorrhage and go home on iron supplements. Paracetamol overdose (A) in young children is often not in large doses due to the tablets being difficult to swallow; it may present with gastric irritation or a history that the child took some tablets, liver failure develops on day 3–5, our case presented on day 2 and you would not expect malaena from paracetamol intoxication. Tricyclic antidepressant (C) overdose would present much earlier than 2 days, with tachycardia, anticholinergic symptoms (dry mouth, blurred vision, agitation). Patients become shocked with seizures or coma and develop severe metabolic acidosis and this is one of the few indications for giving intravenous bicarbonate. Bleach intoxication (D) should be thought of as he was in the bathroom playing on his own; however problems are rare as the bleach does not taste nice and typically there will only be localized lesions where the bleach contacted the mucous membranes.",

    "topic": "Management of the unwell child (3)",
    "explanation": "All of the answers are correct except for (C) which is the dose of adrenaline for cardiac arrest. (D) is the best answer as it is the most important life-saving treatment; IM adrenaline will work to reduce the capillary leak which is producing airway oedema. Once the fluid has shifted out of the vascular space, there is no way to rapidly move it out of the tissues; therefore the key first management of anaphylaxis is to administer IM adrenaline. In reality you would put out an emergency call for an anaesthetist (E) to manage the rapidly closing airway, give further salbutamol nebulizers and gain intravenous access to give hydrocortisone and antihistamine. Give (A) to block the histamine release which is driving the capillary leak and (B) to reduce general inflammation and aim to prevent the late type IV hypersensitivity. It is important not to forget about delayed type IV hypersensitivity; these children should be observed and sent home with two further doses of prednisolone for the next 2 days to cover this.",

Jaundice in the first 24 hours may be due to haemolysis either immune (ABO incompatibility or rhesus disease) or non-immune (G6PD, spherocytosis) and is unconjugated; therefore (B) is incorrect. Jaundice between 24 hours and 2 weeks can be physiological as the phenomenon of breast milk jaundice (A) but should not persist. Hypothyroidism is very important to exclude in the neonate due to the potential learning difficulties that can ensue, but it is unlikely to present with acholic stools. Neonatal hepatitis (D) can be secondary to infection (congenital) or metabolic diseases (alpha-1-santitrypsin, cystic fibrosis), but with the history of pale stools and dark urine a diagnosis of biliary atresia (C) must be fully investigated due to the risk of liver cirrhosis.",

Preterm babies are at risk by virtue of their gestational age. They have respiratory distress, and require artificial surfactant and ventilatory support as their lungs are prone to atelectasis. The lung parenchyma is structurally immature but functional (D). Congenital pneumonia (E) may present with increased work of breathing and focal signs on chest x-ray. Lung hypoplasia (B) occurs due to renal problems or diaphragmatic hernia, where the underlying lung is unable to develop and therefore is impaired functionally.

Babies with a cleft palate (A) also have a similar history but you should expect to see or feel the cleft palate and other dysmorphic features perhaps consistent with DiGeorge’s or Down’s syndrome. Choanal atresia (C) is associated with CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, retardation of growth and development, genitourinary abnormalities and ear anomalies) syndrome. An incoordinated swallowing reflex (D) may exist if there was concern about the neurological or neuromuscular status, but there is no evidence of this from the history.

Transposition of the great vessels (whereby the aorta is attached to the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery attached to the left ventricle) (A) and the Tetralogy of Fallot (multiple defects including VSD, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy and overriding aorta) (C) are both cyanotic presentations but the Tetralogy of Fallot more commonly presents at around 6 months of age with cyanotic spells. Transposition of the great vessels is more likely to present at birth and is only compatible with life if there is a mixing defect in addition (VSD, atrial septal defect, persistent ductus arteriorus). In this child the ductus arteriosus helps to shunt blood to the lungs until it starts to close physiologically. He then is at risk of worsening cyanosis. He needs a prostaglandin infusion to keep the duct open and surgical intervention. The other answer options (B) (VSD is a communication between the left and right ventricles allowing left-to-right shunting), (D) (narrowing of the outflow tract of the left ventricle) and (E) (narrowing of a section of the aorta) are acyanotic and therefore do not account for this presentation.",

A volvulus (B) and intussusception (D) would have significant irritability, abdominal distension and tenderness associated with them, in addition to vomiting. NEC (C) is predominately an illness of the premature infant presenting with abdominal distension and bile stained gastric aspirates.

Children usually present after weaning and exposure to wheat, with diarrhoea, abdominal distension, failure to thrive and wasting, especially of the buttocks. There is often a family history of autoimmune disease such as thyroid disease or diabetes. Crohn’s disease (A) and ulcerative colitis (B) are rare in paediatrics outside of teenagers. Irritable bowel syndrome (D) would be unusual in such a young child but is associated with abdominal pain and bloating with altered bowel habit, including diarrhoea or constipation. It is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion and while weight loss can be seen if the child eats less to avoid symptoms, it is a less prominent presenting feature.

    "explanation": "He is presenting with signs of chronic liver failure, clubbing and palmar erythema. While he does have spider naevi you need at least five to be significant. Slit lamp examination of his eyes revealed Kayser–Fleischer rings which are a sign of Wilson’s disease (C). This is an autosomal recessive defect in copper metabolism that results in copper deposition in the tissues and leads to liver failure with cirrhosis, neurological sequelae, renal involvement and cardiac complications. In addition patients develop haemolytic anaemia due to copper deposits in the red cell membrane. Thus, as he has a palpable liver and spleen, he is anaemic and complaining of upper abdominal pain with stigmata of liver failure, the most likely diagnosis is Wilson’s disease (C). Abdominal tuberculosis (A) is part of the differential diagnosis, but is unlikely to cause such significant signs of hepatic dysfunction, and would not explain the eye findings. Cystic fibrosis (B) may cause clubbing, but you have been given no pulmonary information, making this diagnosis unlikely. Acute hepatitis A (D) would not produce signs of chronic liver failure and normally presents with vomiting and possible jaundice. There is often a palpable liver but splenic enlargement would be unusual. Similarly, glandular fever (usually caused by infection with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)), would not produce signs of chronic liver failure on examination, but the child may give a history of lethargy and have a palpable liver and spleen.

There are no red flags present in the history such as growth failure, a history of delayed passage of meconium, distended abdomen with vomiting, anal pathology or neurological complications affecting the lower limbs. The correct first line management would be advice on increased fluid/fibre intake and exercise (A). Once her stools are softer, behavioural change management around toileting using star charts will help her overcome the toilet avoidance (B). If lifestyle changes do not produce softer stools or she develops vomiting, she may need medical bowel disimpaction with non-stimulant laxatives (D) but this would not be first line management. Stimulant laxatives (E) should not be used as they may produce more abdominal pain, dependence and have an associated risk of bowel perforation. Referral to the surgeons for bowel disimpaction under anaesthesia would be a last resort after failed medical management and underlying causes of constipation have been ruled out or treated.

Gastroenteritis (C) can occur in young infants, especially if parents are not using sterilized (boiled and cooled) water to make up formula. It normally presents with a short history of vomiting and diarrhoea in an unwell infant, and there may be a contact history such as another family member with diarrhea or vomiting. NEC (D) is predominately an illness of the premature infant presenting with abdominal distension and bile stained nasogastric aspirates. When it occurs in term infants there is usually a history of birth asphyxia or severe growth restriction. In the absence of localizing signs to the abdomen in a child this young you would treat with IV antibiotics to cover neonatal sepsis (E) but this does not explain the swelling in the groin. It is worth noting that inguinal hernias all require surgical review whereas umbilical hernias will self-resolve and need no surgical intervention.",

The most common are coeliac and Graves’ disease which are screened for yearly. Autoimmune hepatitis (A) is more common in females and typically presents between the ages of 10 and 30 with either chronic liver failure or acute hepatitis. The ANA will be positive in approximately 80 per cent and the anti-smooth muscle antibody with be positive in approximately 70 per cent of cases. Her pH is normal, so she is not in ketoacidosis (B), and her glucose is raised as a stress response. While she would be isolated in a cubicle on admission in case of gastroenteritis (C), there is no history of diarrhoea and the investigations do not support an infectious cause with a normal white cell count and autoantibodies positive. There is nothing in the history to suggest she is pregnant (D); however it would be good practice to test the urine of any woman of child-bearing age with vomiting or abdominal pain. ANA would normally be positive in SLE (E) but anti-smooth muscle antibodies are associated with autoimmune hepatitis.",

    "answer": "E",

    "topic": "Abdominal pain",
    "explanation": "The answer is NEC (E) which classically affects preterm babies in the neonatal period and would not be a cause of abdominal pathology in an 18-month-old child. Pneumonia in the lower lobes (A) may present as pain in the upper abdomen and fever. Any upper or lower respiratory tract infection in young children can be associated with vomiting, mostly because of inflamed upper airways triggering the gag reflex and increased work of breathing putting pressure on the stomach just below the diaphragm. Mesenteric adenitis (B) is the most likely answer as this is classically how mesenteric adenitis presents, although it is a diagnosis of exclusion, having ruled out other pathology. There is often a preceding viral illness (typically either upper respiratory or gastroenteritis). Enlarged mesenteric glands can be seen on abdominal ultrasound examination. Mesenteric adenitis may be mistaken for appendicitis. While it is unusual for such a young child to develop diabetes (C), even babies can. Infection is often a trigger for new onset or an episode of ketoacidosis in a known diabetic, and this may present with vomiting. Pyelonephritis (D) should always be ruled out in a child with fever and vomiting unless a clear alternative source of infection is identified.",

This diagnosis would not be supported if the child has per rectum bleeding (E). The most common cause of PR bleeding in children is constipation with an anal fissure and this would produce bright red blood on the toilet tissue or streaked on the surface of the stool (A). Intussusception has a late and uncommon sign of ‘redcurrant jelly’ stool (B) which is due to blood and mucus from the distal end of the invaginated segment of bowel becoming necrotic. At this stage there is a risk of perforation, especially if insufflation is attempted. The diagnosis should ideally be made long before these signs evolve. Two per cent of the population have a Meckel’s diverticulum, an ileal remnant of the vitellointestinal duct which contains ectopic gastric mucosa and can lead to ulceration, perforation and a presentation with severe rectal haemorrhage of dark red blood (C). Bacterial gastroenteritis with Shigella or Salmonella may produce blood and/or pus mixed into the stool (D).",

    "question": "A mother brings her 2 year old to see you. She is very worried that he always has diarrhoea or loose stools. He eats a normal diet, and no particular foods seem to upset him but he often still has bits of vegetables or food he has eaten visible in the stool. She thinks he is losing weight and he is starting to potty train, so she is concerned this will affect his ability to anticipate needing the toilet.

    "answer": "A",

    "topic": "Diarrhoea",
    "explanation": "This is toddler’s diarrhoea which is a common cause of loose stool in pre-school aged children and almost always requires no treatment (A). It is likely to be related to immature development of intestinal motility and it resolves in most children by the age of 5. Rarely, if the diarrhoea is socially disruptive to the child, it can be treated with loperamide (B), but he is only just starting to potty train and should be given a chance to do so. ‘Significant social disruption’ would be considered if he has failed to potty train and was unable to start school. He is a well-grown child with no evidence of wasting, so coeliac disease (C) is unlikely and the first investigation for this would be a blood test for anti-endomesial antibodies, not endoscopy. Inflammatory bowel disease (D) would be rare in a child this young, and there is no mention of abdominal pain, passage of blood and mucus or any suggestion of growth failure. While diarrhoea is a common symptom of hyperthyroidism (E), it is more commonly seen in female teenagers or in the neonatal period in infants born to mothers with Graves’ disease.

It is a recurrent inflammatory ulcerating disease of the mucous membrane layer of the rectum which spreads proximally to involve the colon. It classically presents with abdominal pain with blood or mucus mixed into diarrhoea. It is associated with erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, arthritis and spondylitis, which may explain his back and knee pain.

The main distinction is on histology with Crohn’s disease showing non-caseating granuloma and full thickness lesions. Coeliac disease (C) usually presents with malnutrition and abdominal bloating. Diarrhoea may be a presenting feature but blood would be unusual and would be digested, i.e. dark stools.

The most common cause of delayed meconium passage is (E), which is a transient immaturity of the gut resulting in failure to move a plug of meconium along. The management is with anal stimulation with a glycerine chip. Approximately 20 per cent of cystic fibrosis cases will present with a meconium ileus (B) due to inspissated meconium. Approximately one in 4000 babies will have Hirschprung’s disease (A) which is caused by the absence of ganglion cells from the myenteric and submucosal plexi in part of the rectum or colon which results in narrowed bowel in the denervated region. The lack of bowel wall movement fails to move the meconium along. The management is surgical resection of the denervated portion of bowel. An imperforate anus (D) is slightly less common than Hirschprung’s disease, and will require surgical intervention.",

    "topic": "Chronic vomiting and diarrhoea",
    "explanation": "In light of the eczema that has developed since breastfeeding cessation, plus the nappy rash and anal inflammation, the most likely explanation is cow’s milk protein intolerance (A), an allergic reaction to the cow’s milk proteins, which is different from lactose intolerance (B). Cow’s milk protein intolerance typically presents with exposure to cow’s milk in infancy, although in severe cases maternal ingestion of dairy products may affect a breastfeeding infant. The infant has worsening skin inflammation (eczema), vomiting, diarrhoea (which may be bloody), failure to thrive, irritability and colic. Lactose intolerance (B) is typically acquired following acute gastroenteritis. It is unusual in infancy, although rarely it can be congenital. It is a deficiency in the enzyme, lactose dehydrogenase, which breaks down lactose (the disaccharide sugar in milk). The build up of sugars in the gut results in an osmotic diarrhoea and dehydration. This history is too long for gastroenteritis (C) which could be associated with the introduction of bottle feeds if the equipment and water has not been sterilized. Hyper IgE syndrome (D), sometimes referred to as Job’s syndrome, is an autosomal dominant immunodeficiency which is associated with severe eczema and skin boils but does not have significant gastrointestinal presentations. Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (E) is also associated with eczema. This is an X-linked recessive disorder associated with thrombocytopenia, eczema and lymphopenia, but no significant gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Infants with heart failure may develop hepatomegaly and potentially splenomegaly, as a result of back-pressure secondary to right-sided heart failure (C). This sign is more helpful than looking for jugular venous distension in an infant, since the neck is short and the jugular veins are difficult to observe.

The most likely explanation for this acute presentation is croup, which should be treated with dexamethasone as for any other child. His breathing and observations should have improved before he goes home (E). This child does not have a fever and there is no pus on the tonsils to suggest a bacterial infection. Croup is largely due to viral upper respiratory infections, and dexamethasone should be all that is required. He does not need antibiotics ((A) and (D)). Admission for observation (C) would not be unreasonable as a tachycardic child should not be sent home without careful evaluation, but it is not the best answer because you should treat his respiratory distress due to the croup with dexamethasone (E) and admit if no improvement. He is not in heart failure (no gallop rhythm, no crackles in his lung fields, and no hepatomegaly) and he therefore does not need furosemide (B).",

    "question": "A 3-day-old baby is brought to accident and emergency with acute respiratory distress. She is tachypnoeic, tachycardic, cyanosed and her capillary refill is 5 seconds centrally. You note she has a flat nasal bridge, down sloping palpebral fissures and epicanthic folds. On auscultation there is a loud ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal edge.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 194,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of congenital heart disease",
    "explanation": "This is a presentation of a duct-dependent type of congenital heart defect. The ductus arteriosus is a short vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the aortic arch. It allows most of the blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetal lungs which are filled with fluid. Within hours or at the most a few days following birth, the duct closes to form the ligamentum arteriosum. However, any congenital heart defect that results in decreased blood flow from the heart to the lungs, or decreased oxygenated blood on reaching the systemic circulation, will depend on blood flowing through the ductus arteriosus to compensate for the abnormal anatomy. When the duct closes, that circulation stops and infants with Tetralogy of Fallot (D), pulmonary atresia, tricuspid atresia, transposition of the great arteries (C) and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage will go blue. These duct-dependent lesions require urgent re-opening of the duct with prostaglandin. This situation is the opposite of a patent ductus arteriosus (E). The other information you are given describes dysmorphic features of Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21). Down’s syndrome is associated with atrioventricular septal defects, VSDs and Tetralogy of Fallot (D). Coarctation of the aorta (A) does not produce central cyanosis, although the left arm and lower limbs may have reduced blood pressure and saturations depending on the severity of the stenosis. VSDs (B) produce a left-to-right shunt (thus the infant is not cyanosed) unless they are left untreated, when Eisenmenger’s syndrome develops, typically in the teenage years where pulmonary hypertension results in a right-to-left shunt and cyanosis. This process develops slowly and does not present in infancy.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is to cover the baby for sepsis with antibiotics and to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus while organizing an echocardiogram to elucidate the underlying cardiac anatomy (C). A blue baby with a murmur should be treated as a duct-dependent anomaly until proven otherwise. A septic baby could be mottled and present with a flow murmur and until the echocardiogram has been performed it is difficult to rule out sepsis; thus not covering with antibiotics would be wrong (B). You should always administer oxygen to a cyanotic child (A) unless specifically told not to by the cardiology team, and in this situation there would be clear guidelines to maintain the saturations between an upper and lower limit, typically in the 80s. Indomethacin is wrong ((D) and (E)); this is used to close the duct in children who have a persistent ductus arteriosus resulting in significant respiratory distress or impaired systemic oxygen delivery.",

    "answer": "A",

    "explanation": "The ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia with a rate of 180 beats per minute. At this rate it is hard to say if P waves are present or not; however this history of a child with an intercurrent illness suddenly becoming unwell with a tachycardia is suggestive of an SVT (A). SVTs may be triggered by Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (B), a re-entry tachycardia due to an accessory pathway between the atria and the ventricle. Once the rhythm has slowed down there will be a delta wave visible in all QRS complexes, which is a slanting upstroke of the R wave, and this is associated with a short PR interval. All that can be said of this child is that the QRS complexes are narrow and fast, suggesting a supraventricular origin. Ventricular fibrillation (C) would be characterized by a fast wide irregular complex on ECG, with no discernible P waves. Ventricular tachycardia (E) will be characterized by a regular wide complex tachycardia with no visible P waves. Atrial fibrillation (D) would have the classical saw toothed baseline of P waves with a slower rate of QRS complexes superimposed.",

Ideally, these should be carried out while the child is on recorded cardiac monitoring to assess the response. If these do not work, adenosine (B) would be the next step. Failing these actions, sedated synchronized cardioversion (E) is indicated while the patient remains alert. If a patient becomes cardiovascularly compromised, for example is losing consciousness, then the synchronized cardioversion should be carried out urgently without waiting for sedation. Adrenaline (C) would not be used unless the patient loses output. Non-synchronized cardioversion (A) is only indicated for ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia with no cardiac output; this is because in all other situations if the shock lands on the QRS complex it may cause VF.",

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 195,
    "topic": "Prolonged fever with tachycardia",
    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is Kawasaki’s disease (E) as he fulfils the diagnostic criteria (5 out of 6): 1) fever for more than 5 days, 2) bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis, 3) rash, 4) oral changes such as dry, cracked, red lips, strawberry tongue, 5) erythema and oedema of the hands or feet and 6) cervical lymphadenopathy. Inflammation at the BCG scar is common but is not a diagnostic criterion. Kawasaki’s disease is a vasculitis of unknown aetiology that typically affects young children and is complicated by coronary aneurysm formation. Treatment is with intravenous immunoglobulin and high dose aspirin. By 5 days the fever caused by a viral tonsillitis (A) should be settling, even though other symptoms such as cough may persist for some time. This child could have a bacterial tonsillitis (B) and covering with antibiotics would be prudent, but it would be unusual to have conjunctivitis and swollen hands and feet with bacterial tonsillitis. You might expect to see pus on the tonsils if it is due to a bacterial infection. Hand, foot and mouth disease (D) produces a mild coryzal illness, mouth ulcers and painful papules on the hands and feet in young children and is caused by a coxsackie virus infection.

    "explanation": "This child is hypertensive in both arms but there is a discrepancy between the right and left arm with a radio-femoral delay and a systolic murmur heard in the aortic area, supporting a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (B). This is likely to be a mild stenosis which is why it was not picked up earlier. The restricted blood flow to the abdomen and kidneys results in feedback loops producing hypertension to maintain perfusion. The blood pressure in the left arm is still high (A) but it is lower than the right arm because of the coarctation restricting blood flow to the left and lower body. There is no bruit heard on examining the abdomen and other findings point to coarctation, making renal artery stenosis (C) unlikely, but to rule it out an abdominal ultrasound with Doppler would be required. Phaeochromocytoma (D) is a rare cause of hypertension caused by an adrenal tumour producing catecholamines and imaging would be required to diagnose this; therefore it is extremely unlikely to be the correct answer.

    "explanation": "Blood pressure measurements in children need the same considerations as for adult patients. There may be external factors influencing the reading such as pain, anxiety, incorrect cuff size and poor technique. Manual measurements are preferable to automated ones (D). The blood pressure should be repeated on at least three occasions (A) and if still high investigations and management should be initiated with guidance from paediatric nephrologists (B). Sodium nitroprusside (C) is the treatment of choice for malignant hypertension, which is not consistent with the history. Causes of hypertension in children include: essential hypertension, renal (renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, Wilms’ tumour), cardiac (coarctation of the aorta), endocrine (Cushing’s syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, neuroblastoma) and metabolic (hyperaldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Therefore, simple discharge home is not acceptable without considered exploration (E).",

    "explanation": "Henoch–Schönlein purpura (E) is a diagnosis based on a set of symptoms including arthralgia, rash (urticarial to purpuric), abdominal pain and renal involvement (hypertension, nephrotic syndrome). It is a common paediatric condition affecting 3–10 year olds and usually follows a viral illness. It is a vasculitis process which can cause severe gastrointestinal and renal complications but is usually benign and self-limiting. Any child with abdominal pain and vomiting should have their glucose checked as they may be presenting for the first time with diabetic ketoacidosis (A). Viral infections can precipitate a reactive arthritis, though this follows the primary infection (B). Meningococcal sepsis (C) is always a concern in children with a purpuric rash and this must be considered and excluded and, in this case, is less likely with the normal heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate (observations within normal limits). Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (D) may present with the rash, but the other symptoms are unusual with this condition and the platelet count would be low, whereas in Henoch–Schönlein purpura the platelet count is normal.",

    "topic": "Post-infectious complications",
    "explanation": "Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (B) is a serious complication of particularly E. coli and Shigella gastroenteritis. It is caused by a verocytotoxin produced by these bacteria which initiates an inflammatory reaction in vascular endothelium and neutrophil activation. It is recognized by a triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia. The morbidity and mortality results from the renal impairment which may require dialysis or progression to chronic kidney disease (A). Children with severe gastroenteritis of any cause may suffer from dehydration and if water loss is greater than salt loss, this may cause hypernatraemia (C). Children may also suffer with food intolerances (i.e. lactose intolerance) after an episode of gastroenteritis due to damage to the mucosal enzyme activity (E). Henoch–Schönlein purpura often follows a viral infection and is characterized by arthralgia, purpuric rash on the extensor surfaces of the lower limbs, abdominal pain and renal involvement (D).",

    "explanation": "This girl has presented with a scald injury. The accident happened 10 hours before presentation which may arouse suspicion of non-accidental injury, but at present the more concerning feature is the acute kidney injury in a child with clinical shock. Burns damage the protective skin barrier, which allows excessive fluid and electrolyte loss. She may have been losing fluid through the damaged skin during the day, causing worsening dehydration (D); however she is now so fluid depleted that she has pre-renal acute kidney injury and hypovolaemia (E). This may subsequently result in acute tubular necrosis and thus a renal cause of acute kidney injury (C), but the primary cause is (E). The high sodium and haemoglobin would also support the diagnosis. Causes of post-renal acute kidney injury (A) are obstructive, such as ureteric stones, bladder outflow obstruction and neuropathic bladder. Poisoning (B) should be considered in children with drowsiness, especially in the context of non-accidental injury, and clues in the history such as access to illicit substances or medicines.",

    "explanation": "This girl has ITP, characterized by low platelets and mucosal bleeding. It usually occurs a few weeks after a viral illness. It is caused by immune-mediated destruction of circulating platelets within the reticuloendothelial system. It typically occurs in children between 2 and 10 years of age.

However, this girl has continued episodes of bleeding and is tachycardic and hypotensive. She cannot be discharged (E) as she is medically unstable and needs close monitoring and a fluid bolus (D). Platelet transfusion (A) is not usually required as these platelets will be destroyed too, but in life-threatening bleeding with low platelets they may be required. An urgent endoscopy (B) would help to identify a gastric or oesophageal lesion, but given the previous history and low platelets this is not required and may cause harm if it were to cause further bleeding.

    "question": "A 4-year-old girl has just returned from holiday in France where she visited a petting farm. She has had diarrhoea for 2 days, and her mother noticed fresh red blood mixed with the stools. She has also been vomiting. On admission to hospital her blood tests showed: Hb 5 g/dL, WCC 15 × 109/L, platelets 55 × 109/L, urea 19 mmol/L, creatinine 110 μmol/L. Her stool culture is pending.

    "topic": "Thrombocytopenia",
    "explanation": "HUS (E) is a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia consisting of acute kidney injury, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. It occurs secondary to Escherichia coli or Shigella gastroenteritis due to an endotoxin initiating an inflammatory response. Treatment is largely supportive fluid management but may require renal replacement therapy. Renal impairment may resolve but a few can develop chronic kidney disease. IBD (B) is unlikely in this age group but can present with bloody diarrhoea, anaemia, abdominal pain and weight loss. Severe dehydration (C) may result in a pre-renal cause of acute kidney injury leading to raised urea and creatinine (though the urea may be disproportionately high). However, this would not explain the abnormalities of the full blood count. Platelet disorders (A) can lead to mucosal bleeding including haematemesis, haematuria, per rectum (PR) or per vaginam bleeding, and epistaxis. However, it does not explain the renal impairment. HSP (D) is a syndrome consisting of purpuric rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal involvement. It may present with PR bleeding and diarrhoea due to gut vasculitis and renal failure, but there is no evidence of rash or joint involvement.",

    "explanation": "This child is exhibiting pica, a phenomenon of eating substances that are not food, secondary to severe iron deficiency anaemia consistent with microcytic anaemia with low iron stores (ferritin) as well as low circulating iron (C). The most likely cause is due to prolonged breastfeeding and delayed weaning. Children have sufficient iron stores for 4 months after birth. After this time they require supplementation which usually comes from the introduction of pureed and solid foods. Delay in weaning can lead to iron deficiency anaemia, hypocalcaemia and poor weight gain. (A) shows a normal study, with no evidence of anaemia and normal haematinics. (B) shows a macrocytic anaemia with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency (megaloblastic anaemia). (D) shows a microcytic anaemia with normal iron, suggesting another cause such as thalassaemia or sideroblastic anaemia.

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 216,
    "topic": "Haemolytic anaemia",
    "explanation": "Beta thalassaemia (A) is a haemolytic anaemia of autosomal recessive inheritance. Thalassaemia presents with anaemia after 6 months of age, when HbA is starting to be produced. Thalassaemia is present in Mediterranean and Asian populations and is due to a defect in the production of haemoglobin beta chains or alpha chains (beta and alpha thalassaemia, respectively). Patients can be homozygous (disease) or heterozygous (carriers). They present with anaemia and jaundice and may show evidence of extramedullary haemopoeisis (frontal bossing and maxillary overgrowth). Bloods tests will show a normocytic anaemia with hyperbilirubinaemia. A reticulocyte response would be expected with normal bone marrow function. Other non-immune haemolytic anaemias include other haemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (B) (HbSS on Hb electrophoresis and sickle cells on blood film), red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis (D) and elliptocytosis seen on blood film) and red cell enzyme defects (G6PD deficiency (E) and pyruvate kinase deficiency, enzyme testing required for diagnosis), which usually present with acute crises which can be haemolytic, aplastic or with chronic anaemia and jaundice, splenomegaly due to increased red cell destruction. Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemias include ABO (C) or rhesus incompatibility.

She is seen with her nanny who reports finding the bruises when she was getting her dressed this morning. Recently the girl has not been herself. She has had several colds over the past 2 months and has been more lethargic lately. The nanny is worried she is losing weight. On examination she appears withdrawn, pale and has a bruise on the left buttock which is 5 cm × 8 cm. She has three other bruises on her left leg and right arm which are of varying colours.

    "explanation": "This child is presenting with bruising on the buttocks and limbs as well as petechiae which raise alarm bells that the child may have low platelets. The two options on the list with low platelets are idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) (C) or leukaemia (B). This child has a background of being unwell with a suggestion of weight loss which points to leukaemia as the most likely diagnosis (B). Henoch Schönlein purpura (D) does not produce low platelets but could produce the bruising on the buttocks: this would normally be associated with joint and abdominal pains as well as haematuria. It is a small vessel vasculitis which typically occurs 1–2 weeks after a throat infection. ITP (C) also is often triggered after a viral infection and it would be unusual for the child to be unwell at presentation with the bruises. If the full blood count comes back normal that would raise concerns of non-accidental injury (A). The petechiae in the head and neck could be produced by strangulation and the bruises of multiple ages as well as sited on the buttocks is unusual for an accidental injury (E); combined with a withdrawn child this should raise the suspicion of non-accidental injury (A). As you have not been given the full blood count results and the child is unwell with weight loss and recurrent illnesses, the single best answer is leukaemia (B).",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 222,
    "topic": "Newborn rash (1)",
    "explanation": "This is likely to be a port wine stain or naevus flammeus (B) which is a capillary vascular malformation in the dermis, present from birth and will persist for life. When present in the trigeminal distribution, a small proportion of children will have underlying brain involvement (Sturge–Weber syndrome) and should have an MRI brain to look for this as the child will be at risk of seizures and developmental problems. A strawberry naevus (A) or cavernous haemangioma is not usually present at birth and typically appears in the first month. Strawberry naevi will grow larger before shrinking and disappearing, typically before the age of 5 years. They may compress neighbouring structures as they grow and sometimes ulcerate with troublesome bleeding. They are not flat. A capillary haemangioma or ‘stork bite’ (C) is a pink macule found on the eyelids, central forehead or nape of the neck which is due to distension of the dermal capillaries; they mostly fade over the first year. Those on the neck may persist but will be covered by hair. They are not found on the lateral face; therefore this is not the right answer. The child is well, with normal observations, making cellulitis (D) very unlikely. In addition you have been given no information on whether the lesion feels warm, which you would expect in infection. Erythema toxicum (E) is a common innocent rash of the newborn which has an erythematous base with small pustules. It comes and goes all over the body for the first few weeks of life.",

He is systemically unwell, with misery and most probably a fever. He therefore needs intravenous antibiotics and must be referred to hospital (C). If he was not unwell, starting emollients with oral antibiotics would be appropriate, but topical antibiotics are to be avoided since they may rapidly select for resistant organisms and they may themselves be sensitizing (B). This child’s eczema is severe and exploring other contributory factors such as cow’s milk protein sensitivity is part of good management, but a trial of soya based formula without any clear history or investigations is inappropriate (D). He should be started on emollients and soap substitute (A) but this is not the best answer as he needs systemic antibiotics as well.

    "explanation": "This child’s parents have done ‘the glass test’ by pressing a tumbler against the skin, to check if the rash is blanching or not. They are very anxious because they have been taught that a positive glass tests means meningitis, usually caused by meningococcal sepsis (A). However, she is well in herself making this less likely. It would be sensible to admit her for observation even if antibiotics are not started. She has petechiae in the superior vena caval distribution (E) which often occur in situations of raised pressure such as coughing or vomiting but can also be seen in shaken babies or strangulation injuries. In young children coughing bouts often trigger vomiting, but vomiting is a warning sign of meningitis, so she should be monitored. ITP (B) is often triggered about 1 week after a throat infection and it would be unusual for the child to still be unwell and only have petechiae on the face. A strangulation injury by an angry caregiver could produce this pattern of injury; however her coughing and vomiting give a plausible explanation of the lesion, making non-accidental injury (D) unlikely. Henoch–Schönlein purpura (C) is a vasculitis of the capillaries and typically causes a macular papular purpuric rash over the buttocks and extensor surfaces of the limbs, so the distribution of the rash in this case is wrong.",

    "explanation": "This child is rapidly becoming unwell with impending shock (capillary refill 6 seconds). The expanding rash quickly becomes non-blanching and suggests that she has disseminated intravascular coagulation, often seen with meningococcal sepsis (C). Idiopathic thrombocytopenia (B) is usually seen in well children following a recent upper respiratory tract infection. While the urine dipstick has a trace of leukocytes, this is most likely non-specific due to her being so unwell and in the absence of nitrites is not strongly suggestive of a UTI (A). Human herpes virus 6 infection is a very common cause of fever and rash in this age group, not infrequently associated with febrile convulsions, but it does not cause shock and the rash would remain blanching (D). Tachypnoea without chest signs is an indicator of acidosis but the urine dipstick did not have any glucose in it, so this presentation is not due to diabetic ketoacidosis (E).",

Scabies (C) cause itchy rashes due to the burrows of the mite in the skin, usually on the hands, axillae or groin and often involving the web spaces between the fingers.

Type 2 diabetes is due to reduced production of insulin but also peripheral resistance in tissues (E). Diabetes may be acquired with other conditions such as chronic pancreatitis (A), corticosteroid use (B) or cystic fibrosis (C).",

    "question": "A 2-year-old girl was brought by her mother to accident and emergency after 4 days of vomiting and abdominal pain. She had brought her in 2 days ago after developing a cold and was discharged home and diagnosed with a ‘tummy bug’. On examination, she was drowsy, had dry mucous membranes, deep heavy breathing, cool peripheries and tachycardia. Her mother reports a 1-month history of weight loss, excessive drinking and passing large volumes of urine prior to this episode. Her urine dipstick has ketones and glucose. Her blood gas shows the following: pH 7.10, PCO2 kPa 2.1, PO2 kPa 10.0, BE −12, HCO3– mmol/L 18. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "explanation": "This girl has the classical history of developing polyuria and polydipsia with weight loss, now with a viral illness precipitating DKA (C). Abdominal pain and vomiting are common in DKA and the disease process is triggered by insulin deficiency leading to lipolysis and ketone production. This results in the acidosis along with glycosuria osmotically increasing water losses in urine and leads to dehydration, worsening the acidosis. She will likely have high blood sugar which should also be measured in the laboratory as the bedside tests are inaccurate at very high levels. Gastroenteritis ((A) and (B)) can cause both profound dehydration and sepsis (with bacteraemia or viraemia), with ketonuria but there should not be glycosuria. Children with polyuria should have renal function checked (D), but in this setting with acute illness and ketonuria and glycosuria suggestive of DKA, diabetes is a better explanation of polyuria. Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic non-ketotic state (E) occurs as a complication of type 2 diabetes, which is rare in childhood and does not present with ketonuria, though the incidence is increasing with childhood obesity.",

The symptoms are multisystemic and include tachycardia, heat intolerance, diarrhoea, weight loss, amenorrhoea, tremor and psychosis. Carbimazole acts to suppress thyroxine production and therefore reduce symptoms. This girl has got worsening symptoms and therefore the first course of action would be to optimize the dose of carbimazole to reduce the production of thyroxine, and then add propranolol which can be given for symptomatic relief, especially for tremors (D). Propranolol is not a replacement for carbimazole as it does not directly affect thyroxine production (C).

    "explanation": "This girl has features consistent with precocious puberty, which is the onset of puberty at <8 years in girls and <9 years in boys. The causes may be central or gonadal. Central causes will have raised GnRH, FSH and LH levels which stimulate the gonads to produce oestrogen or testosterone. Gonadal causes have low GnRH, FSH and LH due to negative feedback from excessive endogenous production of oestrogen or testosterone. Central causes may include a pituitary tumour which can lead to excessive production of the pituitary hormones (FSH, LH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, prolactin, growth hormone, oxytocin, antidiuretic hormone). The pituitary is in close proximity to the optic chiasm, where the optic tracts decussate from the nasal visual fields. As the chiasm is compressed by the tumour, these tracts are affected leading to a bitemporal hemianopia (D). The other visual disturbances would not be directly related to a pituitary tumour. Monocular blindness (A) may be due to unilateral disease in front of the optic nerve or involving the optic nerve itself, e.g. cataracts, vitreous haemorrhage, retinoblastoma. Central scotoma (B) can result from multiple sclerosis or optic nerve gliomas. Homonymous hemianopia is due to lesions of the optic radiation posterior to the lateral geniculate body, such as stroke or cerebral palsy.

    "question": "A 2-month-old baby is brought in by the babysitter because he has been crying since she arrived to look after him and his right leg looks swollen. He is the only child living in the household. She does not think he is moving it and is worried it is injured. On examination he is miserable, his heart rate is 160, respiratory rate of 56, and capillary refill is less than 2 seconds. He has a swollen right thigh. He cries more when that leg is examined. You note a yellow bruise on his left thigh and two purple bruises on either arm. X-rays show a fracture of the right femur but the arms appear intact. A chest x-ray shows three healing posterior rib fractures. You are highly suspicious of non-accidental injury. What is the most appropriate management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Give analgesia and plaster the leg fracture. Ask the babysitter to bring him back with the parents because he needs to be admitted",
      "B. Give analgesia. Call the duty social worker on-call to get permission to discharge him once his leg has been plastered",
      "C. Give analgesia and plaster the leg fracture. Contact the parents and inform them that he needs to be admitted. Ask them to come to the hospital and inform social services once they have arrived and been updated",
      "D. Give analgesia and plaster the leg fracture. Call the police to bring the parents to hospital",
      "E. Give analgesia and plaster the leg fracture. Call the police to arrest the babysitter for child abuse"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 242,
    "topic": "Bone and rheumatology",
    "explanation": "The most appropriate action is to bring the parents to the hospital to take a full history (C). The child’s safety is paramount and he should not be discharged until a full safety assessment is made and all of his injuries have been assessed and treated. Once the parents are there and have been updated it is then important to inform them of the social services referral, but they cannot refuse it. The child must be kept in a place of safety so discharge is not an option (A). The parents should be informed prior to social services referral (B) unless there are other children in the community that may also need protection, in which case, social services need to be informed and will liaise with the police to bring those children in to a place of safety. It would be inflammatory and counter-productive to bring the parents into hospital by police, although the police will be involved as part of child-safeguarding enquiries (D). There are injuries of several different ages on this child, different colour bruises and healing rib fractures making it unlikely that the babysitter is at fault (E), although it is important to keep an open mind regarding potential perpetrators. An accurate, well-documented history from each person who has cared for the child is crucial.",

    "question": "On a newborn baby screening examination, you see a baby girl born by elective caesarean section for breech presentation. This is her mother’s first child. The examination is normal except for a clunk felt on Barlow’s test and a relocation click on Ortolani’s manoeuvre on the right side. What is the next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Refer to orthopaedics",
      "B. Arrange an ultrasound for 6 weeks of age",
      "C. Refer to physiotherapy",
      "D. Ask a midwife to put on a plaster hip spica",
      "E. Explain to the parents a watch and wait management is most appropriate as most self-resolve"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 242,
    "topic": "Bone and rheumatology",
    "explanation": "This child has several risk factors for developmental hip dysplasia: female, first child, breech presentation. Other risk factors include clubbed foot, family history of hip dysplasia, oligohydramnios and macrosomia. Barlow’s examination of the hips involves pushing the flexed hip backwards testing for dislocation while the Ortolani test starts with the hips flexed and abducted: the examiner’s fingers lift the greater trochanters forward in an attempt to relocate a dislocated hip; if a click is felt, the test is positive. The most appropriate management is to request an ultrasound as an outpatient follow-up at 6 weeks of age (B). This is a sensitive test, and waiting until 6 weeks improves the specificity as many unstable hips self-resolve. If the ultrasound is positive then a referral to orthopaedics (A) would be appropriate at that time. First line therapy would be a Pavlik harness which is put on by specially trained physiotherapists (C) and worn for 6 weeks. Midwives are not trained in administering plasters and a hip spica would be put on post-surgery when first line therapy has failed. Many services would ultrasound all babies with breech presentation even without clinical findings to support hip dysplasia. Left untreated this child may walk with a limp, never walk or develop avascular necrosis of the femoral head and therefore should be actively managed. A watch and wait management plan (E) is therefore inappropriate.",

    "explanation": "All of the above definitions are true except for polyarticular arthritis (D) which is more common in girls and presents with symmetrical arthritis of the wrists, hands, ankles and knees. Occasionally the spine and jaw may be affected as well. By definition, polyarticular arthritis affects more than four joints at presentation for more than 6 weeks. Oligoarthritis (B) presents with less than five affected joints in the first 6 weeks and even if other joints become involved later it is still referred to as oligoarthritis but becomes extended. If the oligoarthritis persists beyond 6 months without extension to five or more joints it is called persistent. Option (A) is a classic description of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of prolonged fever in children, even when minimal or no joint symptoms or signs are evident. Option (C) is a classic description of the findings in psoriatic arthritis. Enthesitis-related arthritis (E) is also called juvenile spondylitis, and refers to inflammation of the entheses, which are the areas where tendon and other connecting tissues join to bone.",

    "question": "A 4 year old is brought to accident and emergency acutely unwell and refusing to walk for the past 2 days. Her parents are not aware of any recent injuries. On examination, she is pyrexial (T = 39.2°C), capillary refill 3 seconds centrally, heart rate 150 beats per minute, respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute. Her right thigh is swollen and slightly erythematous but too tender to examine fully.

    "topic": "Bone and rheumatology",
    "explanation": "This child’s presentation is worrying for osteomyelitis (A) or septic arthritis, in view of the high fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea and a swollen painful leg. This is why the MRI was arranged so quickly. X-rays do not show osteomyelitis changes until about 2–3 weeks later, but the soft tissue swelling may be noticed. An MRI is required to see the inflammatory bone changes early on, which include periosteal reactions. If her x-ray showed a fracture with no known history of trauma, that would raise concerns of non-accidental injury (B), which would need to be explored further. This is not just cellulitis (C) as there is extensive involvement of the soft tissues and bone on the MRI. A reactive arthritis (D) would not present with a high fever and a systemically unwell child. If the hip were involved this would be a septic arthritis. The history is too short for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (E), which requires a 6-week history with no infection identified, and no MRI periosteal reactions supporting osteomyelitis.",

You would expect a positive Gower’s sign, in which the child is unable to get up from the floor without walking his hands up his legs for support. Spinal muscular atrophy (E) would present in infancy with decreased tone and the child would never be able to walk.

    "explanation": "This is a typical febrile convulsion which are associated with rapid rises in temperature. The child is now stable and likely has a viral tonsillitis as the focus of infection. Parents need reassurance and explanation that febrile convulsions are not usually associated with later epilepsy but may recur in future febrile illnesses. Typically, children do not continue to have febrile convulsions beyond the age of 5 years. Management should be regular anti-pyretics and dress the child lightly during febrile illnesses. Oral penicillin (A) should be prescribed for bacterial tonsillitis, either with pus or if the child is unwell clinically. IV ceftriaxone and lumbar puncture (B) would be for suspected meningitis but this 3-year-old child has a clear focus for the fever, no neck stiffness or rash making this unlikely. In children having their first febrile convulsion under the age of 12 months, it is mandatory to rule out meningitis. Phenytoin (D) would be used for status epilepticus (seizure lasting longer than 30 minutes). Buccal midazolam (E) is used in the community for children who have seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes; febrile convulsions are usually short and unless a child has had a prolonged seizure they would not be sent home with rescue medication.",

Parents need to be reassured that the brief seizure is not harmful. A reflex anoxic seizure (B) typically occurs when a child is frightened or hurt, such as a bump to the head. The child goes pale and faints, hypoxia may cause a short seizure, but the child quickly recovers. Absence epilepsy (C) presents with short vacant periods where the child is unresponsive, followed sometimes by a brief period of confusion when they are aware they have missed something. Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome is associated with a spontaneous onset re-entry tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia which may lead to dizziness, shortness of breath and sometimes fainting.

Pre-delivery the fetus was bradycardic and after birth APGARs were three at 1 minute, five at 5 minutes and nine at 10 minutes. Thirty-six hours later on the special care baby unit the baby is irritable and requiring nasogastric tube feeds as he is not sucking well. The tone in his upper limbs is reduced and an EEG showed seizure activity which has been controlled by intravenous phenobarbitone. His cranial ultrasound is normal.

    "explanation": "This child has experienced an hypoxic insult perinatally during his mother’s haemorrhage and is now showing signs of HIE: poor feeding, altered tone and seizure activity on EEG. Mild HIE (D) presents with irritability, startle responses, poor feeding and hyperventilation. Moderate HIE (E) also has altered tone or reduced movement and seizure activity. While ischaemic changes early on may be difficult to see on cranial ultrasound, intraventricular haemorrhage (A) is easily seen and is associated with both hypoxic insults and a cause of seizures in the neonate. This child’s cranial ultrasound was normal. Group B streptococcal meningitis (B) is a serious and life-threatening illness for the neonate and may cause seizures. It is therefore routine practice to treat unwell neonates with antibiotics, but the exposure for this infant is reduced as the delivery was a caesarean section and the CRP has been normal twice, making this an unlikely explanation for this illness. Hypoglycaemia (C) is also a cause of seizures in neonates but the definition is lower in this age group (below 2.5 mmol/L) so this child is not hypoglycaemic.",

    "question": "A 6-year-old boy is registering with a new GP, having just moved to the area. He is in a wheelchair but is able to mobilize with a fast scissoring gait over short distances. He has increased tone in his legs and has scars from previous tendon release surgeries. His upper limbs are normal. His mother says that his school performance is good and he is writing well. She thinks he was going to have a Statement of Special Educational Needs assessment before they moved. As the GP, what is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "explanation": "This child presents with abdominal pain, sometimes with vomiting or associated headache, with a family history of migraine and distinct psychological triggers, making the most likely diagnosis a somatization disorder (C). This term encompasses various different descriptive terms such as abdominal migraine, recurrent abdominal pain, non-organic pain, functional pain and irritable bowel syndrome. Children may experience migraines as abdominal pain and as they get older they develop more classical migraine headaches. Crohn’s disease (A) would usually present in an older child (but can occur in this age group) with changes in bowel habit and failure to thrive. There is often a family history, which is not present in this case. A brain tumour (B) would be more likely to present with headaches rather than abdominal pain as well as having neurological signs and symptoms. Gastric cancer (D) is very rare in children but would have features of poor appetite and weight loss as well. Coeliac disease (E) usually presents with abdominal distension, diarrhoea and failure to thrive.",

There is no specific history of cough and more concerning is her headache and confusion, making the most likely diagnosis tuberculous meningitis (B). She should have a lumbar puncture, provided there are no signs of raised ICP. A chest x-ray would be performed routinely in this case to look for pulmonary TB (C). While migraines (D) may be very troublesome and frequent, they do not cause weight loss and night sweats and investigations for lymphoma or tuberculosis should always be carried out when these symptoms are present.

Tuberous sclerosis is a cause of infantile spasms, associated with hypsarrythmia on EEG, which are treated with vigabatrin. Seizures do occur in neurofibromatosis ((A) and (B)) but are much less common and not usually associated with any imaging changes. West’s syndrome (C) is a syndrome of infantile spasms and developmental regression, one cause of which is tuberous sclerosis. As you are given no information on this child’s development, West’s syndrome is not the best answer when there is clear evidence to support the cause as tuberous sclerosis. Tay–Sachs disease (E) is an autosomal recessive deficiency of hexosaminidase A and presents with seizures, developmental regression, deafness, progressive loss of motor function and increased tone, which is most common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations.",

Autobiographical memory (A) refers to specific events and issues related to oneself such as one’s 60th birthday or the birth of one’s grandchild. Episodic memory (B) is essentially analagous to autobiographical memory. Procedural memory (C) is also known as ‘implicit memory’ (whereas autobiographical would be ‘explicit’) and refers to the memory or knowledge of ‘how to do things’.

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 262,
    "topic": "Psychopathology and classification in Psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Perseveration (E) is seen almost exclusively in organic brain disease, for example dementia. It involves giving an appropriate response to a stimulus the first time but then giving the same response (incorrectly) to a different second stimulus. Note, it is not limited to verbal statements, but may also occur with, for example, motor activity. Confabulation (A) is the phenomenon whereby false memories occur and results in incorrect answers being given. It is a complex concept, may result from the sufferer trying to ‘cover up’ not knowing the real answer and may be confused with deliberate attempts to deceive, or as is often seen in organic brain disease, the sufferer inventing ‘fantastical’ answers, which may be difficult to separate from delusions. Déjà vu (B) refers to the phenomenon whereby the person feels the sense of familiarity of having encountered an event before, even though it is a new experience for them. It may be a feature of temporal lobe epilepsy but is seen in non-pathological states and does not always indicate organic disease. Ganser’s syndrome (C) is an unusual phenomenon whereby people give ‘approximate’ answers, among other symptoms, such as, ‘How many legs does a cow have?’ ‘Five’. It has caused considerable debate as to whether it represents an organic psychotic disorder or a dissociative disorder.

    "topic": "Psychopathology and classification in Psychiatry",
    "explanation": "An illusion is a misinterpretation of a perception, as opposed to a hallucination, in which a new perception is experienced in the absence of a stimulus. Illusions are not usually pathological. An affect illusion (A) is one in which a perception is altered depending on the mood state; in this case a frightened woman wakes suddenly and misinterprets a hanging piece of clothing for an attacker. A completion illusion (B) occurs when there is a lack of attention, and a perception is ‘incorrectly’ interpreted, for example skipping over a misprint in a book because we are tired. Pareidolic illusions (C) consist of shapes being seen in other objects – the classic example being seeing images such as animals in cloud formations. In contrast to other illusions, pareidolic illusions become more vivid with concentration. A tactile hallucination (D) refers to a tactile (‘touch’) sensation in the absence of a stimulus. This scenario does not represent a visual hallucination (E) as the stimulus is real (the dressing gown), but it has been misinterpreted. Had there been no dressing gown and the woman had still seen an assailant, this may then have represented a visual hallucination.",

    "answer": "A",

    "explanation": "An extracampine hallucination (A) is one which occurs beyond the usual range of sensation, in this case, beyond the limits of audibility – there is no possibility that the patient would be able to hear anyone speaking from Finland. These are definite hallucinations as the patient is hearing them, rather than them constituting delusional beliefs. A functional hallucination (B) occurs when a hallucination is experienced only when an external stimulus is present in the same modality. An example may be a patient hearing voices only when he hears classical music. Note that although the stimulus and the hallucination are in the same modality, they do not have to take the same form, e.g. in the example just given the stimulus is music, while the hallucination is voices. Hypnagogic (C) and hypnopompic (D) hallucinations refer to those that occur on falling asleep and waking respectively, and may occur in non-pathological states. An example would be the feeling of falling off a cliff when falling asleep. Reflex hallucinations (E) are similar to functional hallucinations but the stimulus is in a different modality to the hallucination, for example, a woman with schizophrenia hearing voices every time her child looks at her.",

    "answer": "E",
    "page": 263,
    "topic": "Psychopathology and classification in Psychiatry",
    "explanation": "A delusional perception (E) occurs when a normal perception (e.g. seeing a magazine cover) is invested with a delusional meaning (a cult is trying to kill me). The perception is given a whole new false, and usually bizarre, meaning that is specific to the patient and nearly always of monumentous importance. An autochthonous delusion (A) is one that arises out of the blue (and unlike delusional perception is not attached to a real stimulus). It should be distinguished from secondary delusions in which the beliefs are understandable in the context of the sufferer’s mood or history (e.g. a mood-congruent depressive delusion). A primary delusion is by definition un-understandable in any context. Autoscopy (B) refers to the sensation of seeing oneself, although its aetiology and precise psychopathology is controversial. Delusional atmosphere (C), also known as delusional mood, refers to the state of perplexity or bewilderment in which sufferers feel that something is ‘going on’ but without being able to state exactly what. It often occurs prior to a delusion forming and the sufferer will often describe feeling odd and that everything around them has new ‘meanings’ and significance to them in particular. Delusional memory (D) is when a patient recalls an event from the past and interprets it with a delusional meaning. Although this may seem similar to the answer ‘E’, the difference is that the event at the time will not have been invested with a delusional interpretation; it is only afterwards that this occurs.",

    "explanation": "Derailment (B) is a type of formal thought disorder in which there are disjointed thoughts with no meaningful connections. It is commonly seen in schizophrenia, but also presents sometimes in other disorders. Circumstantial thinking (A) is somewhat difficult to describe but occurs when the person talks around a subject exhaustively with only loosely relevant associations. They will usually return to the point but only after many detours of almost irrelevant (or certainly over-inclusive) information. Flight of ideas (C) occurs when thinking is accelerated – associations between ideas are logical to an extent, but the ‘goal’ of thinking changes rapidly, usually because of poor attention as a result of a manic state. Pressure of speech (D) is the ‘verbal’ description of this acceleration (whereas flight of ideas refers to the speed of thoughts as opposed to speech). Thought blocking (E) occurs most commonly in schizophrenia and manifests as the patient suddenly stopping in mid-sentence without them being able to explain why. It is not the same as thought withdrawal, in which the patient believes an external agency is removing thoughts from their head.",

    "explanation": "Persecutory delusions (B) are certainly seen in schizophrenia but they do not form part of the core of ‘first-rank’ symptoms that Schneider described as core to the diagnosis. It should be noted that these symptoms are not pathognomonic of schizophrenia as they have also been observed in other disorders (e.g. 20 per cent of those with biploar disorder). Not everyone with schizophrenia has ‘first-rank’ symptoms. Delusional perception (A) has been described above and is a first-rank symptom. Running commentary (C) refers to third-person auditory hallucinations in which one or more voices discuss in great detail what the person is doing as they do it. Other types of auditory hallucination designated as first-rank include audible thoughts, in which the patient’s thoughts are ‘spoken out loud’, and voices heard arguing with each other. Somatic passivity (D) is the symptom whereby patients feel that their body is being controlled by an external source. While it may be present along with somatic or tactile hallucinations, in itself it is a delusional belief, not a hallucination. Other first-rank passivity phenomena include passivity of emotions or impulses. Thought alienation (E) is similar to the above but involves the patient’s thoughts rather than impulses or feelings. People may feel that their thoughts are being planted (thought insertion), taken away (thought withdrawal) or played out loud (thought broadcasting).",

    "explanation": "Logoclonia (D) describes the symptom of repeating the last syllable of a word repeatedly and is often seen in Parkinson’s disease. It has a different aetiology to stammering or the tics seen in Tourette’s syndrome. Alogia (A) is the phenomenon of ‘not having any words’ and refers to extreme poverty of speech. It is commonly seen in severe negative schizophrenia or dementia. Dysarthria (B) refers to a difficulty in the manufacture of speech, and is usually caused by structural lesions either in the vocal cords or the brainstem. Echolalia (C) is the phenomenon whereby words or sentences that the patient hears are repeated back, sometimes continuously and incessantly. It often has an organic cause such as dementia or brain injury but may also be seen in functional disorders such as schizophrenia. Neologisms (E) are new words created by the patient that have a specific meaning for them, usually involved with their delusional beliefs. It is not the same as using a known word in a different way (known as metonymy).

    "explanation": "This is a difficult question, but actually one that is seen with some regularity by GPs and psychiatrists. The key features here that make this most likely to be a delusion (B) is the thought that people are looking at him excessively, coupled with the intrusive thought that is not his own. In a rumination (D), the patient would recognize the thought as being their own. It is not a hallucination (C) because the thought is not spoken out loud. A compulsion (A) represents a repetitive act, driven by obsessive anxiety. Somatization (E) refers to physical symptoms that manifest as the result of intrapsychic anxiety with no adequate physical explanation. Usually these patients end up having exhaustive negative medical investigations and refuse to accept that there is nothing physical to be found. The important point of this question is that it would be easy to mistake this for obsessive–compulsive disorder or dysmorphophobia. Always assess for more ‘sinister’ symptoms such as psychosis as they can sometimes be hidden beneath more obvious diagnoses.",

Anergia (A), or lack of energy, is a core symptom of depression, although obviously is non-specific. Anhedonia (B), or lack of enjoyment or inability to experience pleasure, is perhaps even more common than anergia. Anorexia (C) as a symptom means lack of appetite and most certainly does occur in depression – this should not be confused with anorexia nervosa which is a specific condition. Insomnia (E), particularly in the form of early morning wakening, is a common and extremely distressing symptom of depression.

    "explanation": "Night terrors (E) are not the same as nightmares, and they do not occur in rapid eye movement sleep – the sufferer (who is usually a child) does not tend to remember any bad dreams, but will awake from sleep in a state of abject terror and confusion, often shouting and sometimes lashing out. Hypnopompic hallucinations are common on waking, particularly seeing insects. Avoidance symptoms (A) are evident here in the form of the patient not wanting to drive his car. Detachment (B) is also present in feeling disconnected from his wife and children. A feeling of derealization or depersonalization may also occur, in which the sufferer feels in some way removed from the world around him or even from his own body. Insomnia is present (C) as the patient is purposefully not sleeping from fear of the nightmares.

    "page": 265,
    "topic": "Psychopathology and classification in Psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Note that the symptoms have been present for more than 1 month which is required for a diagnosis of PTSD (E). The criteria for diagnosis include exposure to a potentially life-threatening event, re-experiencing of the event in various ways such as nightmares or flashbacks, avoidance of stimuli that recall the event (e.g. driving) and increased arousal such as hypervigilance, increased startle reaction, insomnia and sometimes irritability and anger. Depressive symptoms (C) are also extremely common, but the diagnosis here is clearly one with a stressful precipitant. An acute stress (A) reaction must subside within hours or days of a stressful event and results in disorientation and confusion in response to the stressor. Panic and other symptoms of anxiety commonly occur. Adjustment disorders (B) occur in response to a significant and stressful change in life circumstances or events, such as bereavement or emigration. The main symptoms are those of depression or anxiety along with an inability to cope with daily tasks. A dissociative fugue (D) is one of the dissociative or conversion disorders, in which either the body or mind in some way lose their normal integration. They usually resolve after weeks or months and are manifestations of intrapsychic stress. They were originally known as ‘hysterical’ disorders but the term is no longer used because of its sexist overtones. In a dissociative fugue, the sufferer will have a period of amnesia during which he or she will travel, often for long distances, and certainly beyond their usual range of travel. Despite this they often appear normal to passers-by.",

    "explanation": "Clanging (B) is a form of thought disorder whereby words are used based on their similar sounds or rhyming and the meaning becomes unimportant. For example, ‘A cat pat on my hat sack, ate the bait and skated’. It is seen in schizophrenia but would not be a typical feature of catatonia. Catatonia is a state of either stupor in which a patient is entirely unresponsive (E) or excited. It is associated with various conditions, not just schizophrenia, and its exact cause is not known. It appears to be less common than 50 years ago, but the reason for this is not clear. Catatonia can be associated with various symptoms, including catalepsy (A), in which the limbs become rigid. Sometimes patients’ limbs can be moved into unusual positions and will remain in place even if extremely uncomfortable. This is known as waxy flexibility. Catalepsy should not be confused with cataplexy, in which there is sudden and transient loss of muscle tone resulting in collapse. Echolalia (C) is the phenomenon whereby sufferers repeat the words of those speaking to them. Remember that not all catatonic patients are mute, and echolalia is often found in these patients. Negativism (D) is the symptom whereby catatonic patients will appear to automatically do the opposite of what they are asked to do. This is not just resisting instructions or movement but actually attempting to perform the opposite instruction or movement.",

    "topic": "Psychopathology and classification in Psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Dementia (A) can certainly be classified in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV, although the various subtypes of dementia are not necessarily accurately definable. For instance, Lewy body dementia is not represented in ICD (or at least not in the section related to psychiatric disorders, it is mentioned in the neurological disease section, but this is not usually used in mental health settings). DSM-IV is a multiaxial system (B), in other words a diagnosis will be made up of several different axes. These are: Axis 1 – clinical disorders, Axis 2 – personality disorders and learning disability, Axis 3 – acute medical conditions and physical disorders, Axis 4 – psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder, and Axis 5 – global assessment of functioning. In this way it differs from ICD-10 which uses only a single category per diagnosis. Homosexuality was, to many people’s surprise, still included in the ICD (European) system until 1990 and the DSM (American) system until 1986. It can still be found vestigially as a category relating to ‘ego-dystonic sexual orientation’ in ICD-10. ICD-10 (D) is a WHO system of coding diseases, symptoms, social circumstances and injuries. The first categories in ICD-10 (E) are related to organic disorders (F00–F09). There has been some attempt by ICD-10 to classify disorders ‘hierachically’, with organic disorders needing to be excluded first and therefore placed first. This, however, is just one of the many various controversies surrounding the classification systems used currently in psychiatry, the scope of which is well beyond this book.",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 275,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Delirium tremens (B) is a syndrome caused by alcohol withdrawal in patients with a long history of alcohol consumption, or more likely alcohol dependence. It is a medical emergency and is characterized by autonomic instability, nausea and vomiting, altered mental state (‘delirium’), tremor (‘tremens’), and sometimes seizures. The first symptoms usually appear within 6–12 hours of the last drink and peak at around 24–48 hours. Patients may also complain of hallucinations, usually visual, which take the form of seeing small insects. Note, this is not the same as formication, which technically is the physical sensation of feeling insects crawling over one’s skin. This is commonly seen in cocaine intoxication, but rarely can also be seen in cocaine withdrawal (C). However, cocaine withdrawal is not usually associated with autonomic instability or fitting. Alcoholic hallucinosis (A) is a syndrome also caused by withdrawal from alcohol in those dependent on it. Hallucinosis can also occur in those that continue to drink, although this is rarer. Alcoholic hallucinosis is sometimes taken to mean a relatively rare condition where verbal auditory hallucinations occur alone and in clear consciousness, and is often mistaken for schizophrenia. Whichever definition is taken, the presence of autonomic instability and fits would rule out alcoholic hallucinosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis (D) may present with confusion, although sweating would be uncommon. Patients may complain of severe thirst, and possibly chest or abdominal pain. On examination, patients will appear dehydrated and may have a distinctive smell of ketones on the breath. Fits would be relatively uncommon compared to a decreased level of consciousness. Opiate overdose (E) would not present in this way – patients would exhibit respiratory and central nervous system depression.",

    "answer": "D",
    "page": 275,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "This question relates to the likely blood results in chronic alcohol misuse. Chronic alcohol dependence is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency (D), both as a result of poor nutritional intake and a direct toxic effect of alcohol on bone marrow. B12 is involved in DNA synthesis and this leads to an impairment in erythrocyte metabolism, resulting in larger cell volumes before they divide. This will be evident on a full blood count with a raised, not lowered, MCV (C). Other effects of alcohol on blood and blood chemistry include a decrease in platelet count, known as thrombocytopenia, as opposed to thrombocytosis (raised platelet count) (E). This results from both vitamin deficiency (B12/folate) and again a direct toxic effect of alcohol. The low platelet count is not usually symptomatic. Alcohol is also generally associated with hypoglycaemia as opposed to hyperglycaemia (A), although the latter can also occur. Therefore, serum glucose would be less helpful in diagnosing chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol also causes hypokalaemia as opposed to hyperkalaemia (B). There may be numerous causes for this, such as decreased intake through poor nutrition or vomiting, but it is also thought to occur through decreased tubular reabsorption of potassium secondary to a low magnesium level.",

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 275,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "This is a clear case of delirium, or acute confusional state characterized by a recognized causative factor (infection), older age and fluctuating confusion. Acute confusional states are extremely common in medical inpatients (perhaps in the region of 30 per cent of those over 65 in hospital). It is extremely important that it is managed well – while it has traditionally been considered a transient syndrome with no sequelae, there is growing evidence that delirium leads to increased psychiatric and physical morbidity. When managing delirium, the first steps should be conservative (E) unless the patient is putting themselves or others at significant risk of harm. While this scenario is distressing (at least for the nursing staff), there is no evidence that this is the case. Therefore, initially patients should be treated with intensive nursing interventions. These may include nursing the patient in a side room, keeping lighting appropriate to the time of day, repeated reassurance, the use of prominently visible clocks to orient the patient. Only if the patient continues to become very distressed should medication be considered. The best treatment for delirium is contentious, but guidelines currently suggest that low-dose antipsychotics such as haloperidol (B) are the most appropriate. Haloperidol is a ‘typical’ antipsychotic with relatively few anticholinergic effects. This is thought to be useful as the cholinergic system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of delirium and anticholinergic drugs are a common cause of acute confusional states in older age. Newer, or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics may also be useful but have been studied far less than haloperidol. However, you would not use haloperidol intravenously unless patients were refusing medication via the oral route. Benzodiazepines ((C) and (D)) are second line agents, although they are probably the agents used most commonly in medical inpatient settings for treating delirium. They are prone to causing respiratory depression, and can cause a syndrome of ‘paradoxical excitation’ whereby the delirium appears to worsen with their use. If the delirium is caused by alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, then they may be the most appropriate medication. The principles of using medication in delirium are to use the lowest dose possible, review regularly and remember to discontinue them after the delirium has resolved. The inconsistent use of medication as required, particularly benzodiazepines, may lead to falls – it is far better to use small doses regularly and review their effects. Clozapine (A) is a potent antipsychotic reserved for the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and therefore not an appropriate drug choice here.",

    "question": "Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with an organic depressive disorder?",

      "B. Sertraline",
      "C. Thyroxine",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 276,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Prednisolone (A) is a corticosteroid with numerous uses, including autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. It has long been observed that corticosteroids can cause psychiatric side effects. While this is most commonly thought of as mania (‘steroid psychosis’), they also may cause depressive disorders. Mania is probably more common than depression, but the two may coexist. Depression may result from the acute use, chronic use or discontinuation of corticosteroids. This is thought to be mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis, which has a complex but undoubted role in the regulation of mood – depression is commonly seen in Cushing’s disease, probably as a direct result of a state of chronic hypercortisolism. Sertraline (B) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants. There has been widespread debate about whether SSRIs cause an increase in suicidal thoughts. The NICE guidelines on depression indicate that there may be a small increase in suicidality in the very early stages of antidepressant use. However, it is important to note the following: \n  •   There appears to be no higher risk with SSRIs compared to other antidepressants. The risk of clinically important suicidal behaviour is highest in the month before starting antidepressants and declines thereafter.\n  •   There is no temporal association between antidepressant use and completed suicide. It has been observed that in the initial stages of antidepressant treatment, motivation and energy usually improve prior to improvements in low mood, which may in some part be attributable to the increase in suicidal thoughts.\n  •   The increase in suicidal thoughts may in part be the result of those patients in whom side effects are troublesome, such as akathisia (restlessness), which is itself an independent predictor of suicidal behaviour.\n  •   The risk appears to be slightly higher in adolescents and young adults.\n  Overall, it is recommended that those at potentially higher risk (younger, experiencing side effects, suicidal thoughts prior to starting medication) should be monitored with increased frequency. A medication with a low toxicity (e.g. SSRI) should be used to avoid the increased risk of death in overdose. Thyroxine (C) is not associated with depressive reactions. In fact, thyroxine is the first line treatment for hypothyroidism, which itself may be associated with depression. Tramadol (D) is an opioid analgesic. Opiates are not associated with depressive reactions, and as they cause central release of serotonin, they may in fact have antidepressant properties. There have been case reports of successful augmentation of usual antidepressant treatment with opioids in treatment-resistant depression. Trytophan (E) is an essential amino acid and a precursor of serotonin. It is therefore occasionally used as an augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant depression, although the evidence for its use is unclear.",

    "page": 276,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "This man is exhibiting signs consistent with a frontal lobe (B) injury, and more specifically an orbitofrontal insult. The frontal lobe is extremely vulnerable in traumatic brain injury. Frontal lobe syndromes can take many forms, but often involve changes in personality including:\n  • Inappropriate or ‘fatuous’ affect\n  • Lability and irritability of mood\n  • Hypersexuality\n  • Hyperphagia, or overeating\n  •   ‘Childishness’ or prankish joking (known as ‘Witzelsucht’)\n    There is usually no insight into this change in behaviour. Other changes include poor concentration and ‘forced utilization’ – a strange phenomenon when patients will use objects they see in front of them irrespective of whether they need to use them or not, e.g. patients may get undressed and go to bed on entering a bedroom in the middle of the day despite not being tired. There may also be the emergence of primitive reflexes, such as the grasp reflex. The basal ganglia (A) are deep grey matter (subcortical) structures with strong connections to the cortex and thalamus. They have complex roles in motor behaviour, but because of their strong connections to the frontal cortex there may also be neuropsychiatric symptoms in basal ganglia disorders. However, these are usually associated with ‘negative’ symptoms such as slowing of movement and lack of spontaneity. There may also be an increase in obsessional symptoms, and the basal ganglia are thought to be heavily involved in the pathogenesis of OCD. Given their anatomical location, contusions to the basal ganglia are uncommon, but they are very susceptible to cerebral hypoxia. The limbic system (C) involves deep structures such as the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, the amygdala, the fornix, cingulate gyrus and the thalamus. They have varied functions, but are principally involved in pleasure responses and memory. Injury to the limbic system would almost certainly result in some sort of amnesic syndrome, which is not the case in this question. Lesions of the parietal lobe (D) are associated with visuo-spatial deficits – either ‘agnosia’ (inability to recognize objects) or ‘dyspraxia’ (inability to coordinate motor activities). There may also be dysphasias, either motor or sensory depending on the site of the injury. Gerstmann’s syndrome is a particular syndrome of parietal lobe injury consisting of four components, namely:\n  1. ‘Left-right’ disorientation\n  2. Dyscalculia (inability to perform arithmetical tasks)\n  3. Finger agnosia (inability to distinguish the fingers on the hand)\n  4. Agraphia (inability to write).\n  Non-dominant parietal lobe injuries may lead to body image disturbances, such as ‘anosognosia’ (inability to recognize injury to a particular limb) or ‘hemisomatognosia’ (the feeling that one side of the body is missing).\nOccipital lobe (E) injury tends to result in complex visual disturbances that are often baffling. There may be vivid visual hallucinations. A very odd situation, known as Anton’s syndrome, can occur in bilateral occipital lobe injury, in which the patient is cortically blind but has no insight into this and continues to affirm adamantly that they can see.",

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman is admitted to hospital systemically very unwell, with a reduced level of consciousness, headache, fever, nausea and vomiting and dysphasia. This is followed by several seizures. Initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows the CSF is clear, with raised protein, raised mononuclear cell count, no polymorphs and normal glucose. Her partner says that for the preceding few days she had been acting strangely, seeing things that were not there, accusing him of leaving the gas on and getting very agitated. She then became drowsy and he called the ambulance. Your initial management should be based on which being the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 276,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "While there are no pathognomonic features of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (B), the clinical history is strongly suggestive of an encephalitic picture. It is important to have an extremely low threshold for treating presumed HSV encephalitis, in part because if left untreated there is an extremely high (approximately 70 per cent) mortality rate, and the treatment (intravenous aciclovir) is relatively non-toxic. HSV encephalitis nearly always targets the temporal lobes and orbitofrontal structures. This is the most likely explanation for the preponderance of unusual behaviour or psychotic symptoms in the early stages of the illness, as can be seen here. The woman accusing her partner of leaving the gas on is most likely an olfactory hallucination, which are common in temporal lobe disorders. The rapidly advancing neurological signs indicate a generalizing cerebral infection. The CSF analysis is also typical of viral encephalitis (or meningitis) – showing markedly raised protein, normal or slightly low glucose, a clear appearance and a preponderance of mononuclear cells. This is opposed to bacterial meningitis (A) in which the CSF is more likely to be turbid or purulent, with a preponderance of polymorphonuclear cells, raised protein, and very low CSF glucose. There are also no other signs consistent with bacterial meningitis in this case, such as the typical meningococcal rash, or other signs of meningism (neck stiffness, photophobia). While there is nausea and vomiting, this is non-specific and is often present in encephalitis as there will be some concomitant irritation of the meninges. Neurosyphilis (C) would be uncommon in a woman of this age, although certainly not impossible. It is possible to have an early (usually within 2 years of the primary infection) acute syphilitic meningitis, but this would not fit with the history (as per bacterial meningitis above). The history is too quick to fit with subacute and chronic neuropsyphilis. Late neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis and ‘general paralysis of the insane’) are extremely rare these days, but they must be borne in mind as causes of unusual pain symptoms in the former and atypical dementia in the latter. Sporadic CJD (D) would present with a rapid onset (over weeks or months) of dementia associated with mood symptoms, spasticity and blindness. There are certain features here that would be consistent with temporal lobe epilepsy (E). However, temporal lobe seizures are usually gradual in onset and are often characterized by a motionless stare and automatisms (unusual and unconscious motor behaviours such as chewing or hand-rubbing, but may be more complex such as actually cooking or driving). Auras (unusual sensations immediately preceding a seizure) are common and may mimic typical psychotic hallucinations. They may occur in any modality. The extreme deterioration following a few days’ history of strange behaviour would therefore not fit with typical seizure activity.",

Up until then he was coping very well with his diagnosis. What is the most likely cause of these symptoms?",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 277,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Hypercalcaemia (A) is a common complication of squamous cell carcinoma. The likely cause of this is due to the tumour releasing large amounts of parathyroid-related peptide leading to increased bone turnover. There may also be direct bone destruction from tumour invasion. Hypercalcaemia typically results in the classic syndrome of ‘stones’ (kidney stones), ‘bones’ (bone pain), ‘groans’ (constipation), ‘psychic moans’ (depression, aesthenia, confusion). Thirst is also a common symptom exacerbated by osmotic diuresis, as are nausea, vomiting and anorexia. If depression is the main presenting feature, it is extremely important to rule out metabolic disturbances in patients with cancer. Do not assume that the depression is a psychological reaction to the diagnosis of cancer (although of course this is also extremely possible) – hypercalcaemia is very correctable and symptoms will reduce quickly as the calcium level drops. Hypocalcaemia (B) will more likely present with peripheral neurological signs, such as hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, tetany (such as main d’accoucher or Trousseaus’s sign – carpal spasm occurring in the presence of a blood pressure cuff inflated above systolic pressure, and Chvostek’s sign – facial tetany induced by tapping the ipsilateral angle of the jaw). Paraesthesia and bruising of the skin may also occur. There may be psychiatric symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia, but they do not appear to follow a particular pattern. Hyperkalaemia (C) does not tend to present with psychiatric symptoms, but will commonly result in diffuse muscle weakness and fatigue. Hypokalaemia (D) may also present with these symptoms, but there may also be depression and sometimes anxiety. Hypophosphataemia (E) usually results in a delirium-like picture along with a wide range of motor problems.",

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 277,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Wilson’s disease (D), also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The mutation (of which there are over 200 described) occurs in a gene on chromosome 13q (designated ATP7B), which encodes for a protein that is responsible for transporting copper for excretion in bile. Dysfunction of this protein therefore leads to copper accumulation in numerous tissues in the body, particularly the liver (causing jaundice) and the nervous system. Another extremely suggestive feature is the presence of Kayser–Fleischer rings, which are greenish-gold or brownish rings in the cornea resulting from copper deposition. Note that Kayser–Fleischer rings are now no longer thought of as purely pathognomonic of Wilson’s disease as they may occur in other disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis. Neuropsychiatric consequences of Wilson’s disease include aggression, reckless behaviour, disinhibition and sometimes self-harming behaviours. There are also prominent neurological symptoms, including the ones detailed above. Huntington’s disease (HD) (A) is an autosomal dominant inherited movement disorder. The genetic defect in HD is an expansion of a CAG triplet repeat at the 5′ end of a gene on chromosome 4p. The protein product of this gene is known as huntingtin. Its physiological function is unknown, but the triplet repeat codes for a polyglutamine tract at the N-terminus of the intracellular protein. This causes the accumulation of inclusion bodies within the cell which lead to cell death. Neuropathologically, there is cell loss in the basal ganglia, substantia nigra and cerebellum. The clinical symptoms are choreoid and athetoid movements, dementia and personality changes. The disease usually has an onset in the 4th–5th decades, but the disorder does show the unusual phenomenon of anticipation, when the age of onset decreases with subsequent members of the pedigree affected. This is due to expansion of the CAG repeat. Multiple sclerosis (B) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by demyelination. Its aetiology is unknown. It is either episodic or progressive, but is almost invariably fatal. It is characterized by a wide range of neurological, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Other organs are not involved. It usually begins somewhere in the 3rd–6th decades. The psychiatric symptoms may also take on diffuse forms, but often patients have been described as presenting with euphoric symptoms. Cognitive symptoms, including frank dementia, are very common and more stable than the psychiatric presentations. Multiple system atrophy (C) is a rare disease of unknown cause. It shows clinical similarities to Parkinson’s disease (PD), but pathologically there is more involvement of the putamen and caudate nuclei. There are also no Lewy bodies present in the substantia nigra, unlike PD. Also unlike PD, patients do not tend to develop dementia. Sleep disorders and depression are common however. Juvenile or young-onset Parkinson’s disease (E) is extremely rare (only approximately five per 100 000 under 40). Patients show similar symptoms to ‘classic’ PD but tend to have more dystonic symptoms. Depression may occur, but dementia, which is common in classic PD, would be almost unheard of in young patients.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 277,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "Depression (C) is extremely common in stroke, with estimates in the literature of a prevalence of either early or late depression at 1/3. This is higher than would be expected as a result of chronic disease alone and suggests some causative mechanism of the disease process itself. Of course, many of the symptoms of stroke may make the diagnosis more difficult (e.g. apathy, emotional lability, poor concentration). Equally, depression may easily be missed in aphasic patients, who will be particularly at risk because of the added isolation of being unable to communicate. There is of course now growing evidence about the phenomenon of ‘vascular depression’, in which depressive disorders are thought to be directly related to accumulative cerebrovascular disease rather than clinically significant or recognized episodes of stroke. Psychotic disorders, including the experience of delusions (B) or hallucinations (D), have been less studied than depression in stroke patients. However, they are thought to occur in approximately 1–2 per cent of stroke sufferers. In patients with co-morbid dementia, care must be taken when deciding on management of psychosis in stroke given the association of antipsychotics with increased risk of death in these patients. Anxiety symptoms (A) are common, and a generalized anxiety disorder may be seen in up to one-quarter of patients. Obsessive–compulsive symptoms (E) in stroke have not been particularly well studied, in part because anecdotally they are rare.",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 277,
    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "The symptoms of amnesia and confabulation are very typical of tumours involving the wall or floor of the third ventricle (A). Structures around this region include the thalamus and hypothalamus, which would also explain the other symptoms of hypersomnia, hyperphagia, pyrexia and polydipsia. The raised serum osmolality points to cranial diabetes insipidus secondary to tumour effects on the hypothalamus. Tumours of the cerebellum (B) would present with fewer psychiatric symptoms, although given its location in the posterior fossa, raised intracranial pressure would be common, which may present with dementia-like symptoms, and therefore the memory problems and confabulation may fit – the other symptoms, however, point to the involvement of diencephalic structures. There may be involvement of brainstem structures, with vomiting and headache. Typical cerebellar signs obviously may also occur such as ataxia and nystagmus. Corpus callosum tumours (C) produce profound psychiatric problems and a rapid deterioration of higher functions. This may present as severe memory problems and an almost catatonic state. Frontal lobe tumours (D) would tend to cause changes in personality but often can be mistaken for dementia. Almost any psychiatric symptoms can occur, but neurological symptoms tend to be relatively scarce. Tumours of the pons (E) tend to be aggressive gliomas. They tend to present as in (B) with brainstem signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting, diplopia, drowsiness and dysarthria.

    "topic": "Organic psychiatry",
    "explanation": "SLE (D) is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder that may affect any organ in the body. It commonly presents in women (9:1 female to male ratio), usually in the third or fourth decades. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur at the beginning of the natural course of the disorder, without any seeming involvement of other organ systems. Unexplained psychotic symptoms, which may closely resemble schizophrenia, may occur, as may a dementia-like illness or affective disorders. This woman is also displaying neurological signs, making a diagnosis of a functional psychiatric disorder unlikely. The presence of Parkinsonism, widespread muscle pain, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are all consistent with the diagnosis. The ‘malar rash’, which is highly indicative of SLE, is present in this woman but its absence does not negate the diagnosis. Behçet’s disease (A) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent mouth ulcers, genital ulcers and uveitis. Neurological or psychiatric symptoms are uncommon and usually a late presentation. It also tends to present in the third or fourth decades, but tends to be more common in men. The CREST syndrome (B) is a form of systemic scleroderma characterized by the following five cardinal features from which the acronym is derived: calcinosis, in which there is calcium deposits in the soft tissue, usually under the skin; Raynaud’s phenomenon, in which there is bilateral cyanosis of the hands in response to cold or stress; oesophageal atresia, which presents with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux; sclerodactyly, in which there is thickening of the skin of the hands and feet, taking on a ‘shiny’ appearance; finally, telangiectasia, which are lesions caused by dilated blood vessels and usually present on the face or hands. Psychiatric complications have been little studied in this disorder, although depression certainly does occur. Graves’ disease (C) is an autoimmune thyroiditis, which incidentally may occur co-morbidly with SLE, although the greatest association is with rheumatoid arthritis. The characteristic symptoms include those of hyperthyroidism, which in psychiatric terms may resemble an anxiety disorder, with tachycardia and palpitations. There may be unexplained weight loss. Systemic symptoms, such as malaise, are also common, as is exophthalmos and pretibial myxoedema (‘orange peel’ skin on the shin). The psychiatric symptoms tend to either resemble an anxiety disorder, or other affective symptoms. Like SLE, women are more commonly affected, and usually in their 20s or 30s. Wegener’s granulomatosis (E) is an autoimmune vasculitis that typically affects the lungs, kidneys and nervous system. It affects males slightly more often with a slightly later peak of incidence (fourth and fifth decades). The typical presentations are with dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, nasal ulceration, sinusitis, systemic symptoms, haematuria, and neurological symptoms – typically peripheral neuropathy but sometimes strokes and seizures. Psychiatric complications have not typically been described except in case reports.",

    "explanation": "Nicotinic acid, or niacin, deficiency (A) is also known as pellagra. It classically manifests with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, anorexia and gastritis. The dermatological manifestations include symmetrical, bilateral bullous lesions in sun-exposed areas. The psychiatric symptoms initially manifest as apathy, depression, or irritability. However, in later stages there are more florid symptoms resembling delirium, psychosis or a Korsakoff-like presentation. If identified, treatment with nicotinic acid usually leads to prompt and dramatic improvements in mental state. Vitamin A deficiency (B) is associated with night-blindness, dry skin and hair and anaemia. Thiamine, or vitamin B1 deficiency (C) is known as beriberi. The classical symptoms of this disorder are neuropathy and heart failure. Acute depletion of thiamine, as seen in alcohol dependence, leads to Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Vitamin C deficiency (D) leads to scurvy, characterized by anorexia, diarrhoea, irritability, anaemia, gingival haemorrhage, poor wound healing, leg pain and swelling over the long bones. Vitamin D deficiency (E) leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. There is now growing evidence of some link with vitamin D to cognitive functioning. There are speculations about its role in seasonal affective disorder whereby patients have normal mental function during the year but during a particular season, e.g. winter, will display a mood disorder such as depression year after year during that season.",

Similar risk factors appear to exist for suicide in people with epilepsy than in the general population, such as co-morbid psychiatric illness (which is also over-represented in people with epilepsy). Epilepsy is not usually associated with enduring personality difficulties (B). Automatisms (A) are unusual and sometimes complex repetitive motor activities observed in nearly all forms of epilepsy, but commonly associated with complex partial seizures (such as temporal lobe epilepsy). They are nearly always observed during a seizure (ictal) or in the post-seizure delirium (post-ictal). Psychotic symptoms are positively correlated with epilepsy (C). This is particularly true of temporal lobe epilepsy, but probably is also over-represented in other types of epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy (E) is associated with psychological and psychiatric symptoms such as aura, sensory disturbances and depersonalization or derealization.

It commonly presents in the sixth decade of life, e.g. earlier than the typical onset of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Because of its predilection for frontal and anterior temporal parts of the brain, it tends to present with changes in behaviour and personality before amnesic symptoms are obvious. This can lead to devastating consequences for those affected and their families. Alzheimer’s disease in younger people ((A) and (B)) is often associated with specific familial inherited genetic mutations. There are numerous mutations, affecting the APP gene on chromosome 21 and the presenelin 1 and 2 genes on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively. Alzheimer’s disease is still the major cause of YOD. Down’s syndrome (C) confers a much greater risk of dementia, with a prevalence estimated at around 50 per cent of those with Down’s syndrome in those aged 60 or above.

    "explanation": "The features described are typical of acute intermittent porphyria (B), a relatively rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder, typically presenting in the second to fourth decades. It is a disorder of haem metabolism resulting in a build up of porphyrins and their precursors. Attacks are usually precipitated by one of a number of factors, including menstruation, alcohol, poor nutrition and certain drugs, such as the OCP. Porphyria can often be mistakenly diagnosed as a primary psychiatric disorder. Abdominal pain in any patient with psychiatric symptoms should always prompt further investigation. Acromegaly (A) is a disorder caused by increased growth hormone secretion, usually by a growth hormone-secreting tumour of the pituitary. It would usually present slightly later than adolescence/early adulthood. There are no psychiatric disorders commonly associated with this condition. Diabetic ketoacidosis (C) could present with abdominal pain but peripheral neuropathy would be unusual in a person of this age. Psychosis itself would also be uncommon, although of course confusion and clouding of consciousness are very highly associated with ketoacidosis. Heroin intoxication (D) would not present in this way. Opiate withdrawal may present with abdominal cramps and muscle aches, but frank weakness and changes in reflexes would be uncommon. Sickle cell anaemia (E) often does present with abdominal crises. However, it would be very rare in a white individual and would normally have presented long before the age of 19.

    "topic": "Subtypes of schizophrenia",
    "explanation": "Classifying schizophrenia into subtypes is by no means simple in psychiatry. The term schizophrenia encompasses a heterogenous group of disorders, and as yet there has been no system of classification that has adequately been able to predict development of specific subtypes or reliable prognosis. That said, our current classification systems have divided schizophrenia into various types, and it does appear that, within limits, there is some utility to these categories. Hebephrenic schizophrenia (A) (sometimes referred to as ‘disorganized’ schizophrenia), is characterized by the predominance of thought disorder and affective symptoms. Social withdrawal is common. The affect is often fatuous and childlike. Delusions and hallucinations are often present, but are usually fragmented and are not the most striking feature. Negative symptoms tend to develop early and quickly, and for this reason this subtype is considered to have a poor prognosis. Catatonic schizophrenia (B) is characterized best by psychomotor disturbances, or catatonic behaviour. Catatonia is another complex concept which appears to have heterogenous aetiologies. In this subtype, there may be marked psychomotor retardation, with stupor, or florid over-activity. There are often unusual symptoms such as automatic obedience, in which people will follow a command without questioning, or the opposite (negativism). In severe cases, people may take on odd postures for long periods, or the limbs may be moved into positions and will remain there (waxy flexibility). Hallucinations and delusions may be present but again do not dominate the picture. For some unknown reason, catatonia appears to be much less common than in the middle part of the last century. Paranoid schizophrenia (C) is often thought of as the ‘classical’ subtype, and is dominated by delusions and hallucinations. Thought disorder is less common (although this is also contentious). Residual schizophrenia (D) refers to late-stage schizophrenia in which the syndrome of ‘positive’ symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder) are replaced by predominately ‘negative’ symptoms (apathy, social withdrawal, avolition, blunting of affect, poverty of speech, self-neglect). Simple schizophrenia (E) is defined by ICD-10 as ‘the insidious development of oddities of conduct, inability to meet the demands of society, and decline in total performance’. There are usually no overt psychotic symptoms.",

    "explanation": "Traditionally, the lifetime prevalence has always been quoted as 1 per cent, although most recent studies would suggest it is lower than this at around 0.4 per cent (with, obviously, some range around this). Regardless, this means the answer could only realistically be (C). Incidence rates are reported as lower (because of the chronic nature of the disease), usually between 0.17 to 0.54. Apart from a few exceptions, the prevalence of schizophrenia tends to be fairly standard across countries, with little overall sex differences.",

    "explanation": "Schizophrenia is undoubtedly a disease with both genetic and environmental substrates. It is generally held that the genetic component accounts for approximately 50 per cent of susceptibility. Although there is some debate around this (more recent studies suggest heritability up to around 80 per cent, although there is large heterogeneity), (E) would be the only really feasible answer. There is undoubtedly an increased risk (B) of schizophrenia between identical twins, that is beyond that of sharing an ‘environment’. The risk of 1 in 100 (C) is approximately the risk in the general population (although see the question above; the prevalence may well have been overestimated in earlier studies). The risk of 1 in 10 (D) could be estimated to be the risk of developing schizophrenia if you have one first degree relative with the disease.",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 293,
    "topic": "Antipsychotics (1)",
    "explanation": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) (C) is a medical and psychiatric emergency. It often presents to accident and emergency or general practice so you must be familiar with recognizing it and the fundamentals of treatment – without treatment it has a mortality of up to 30 per cent. NMS occurs as a complication of antipsychotic medication use (and occasionally other psychotropics) and is thought to be the result of dopamine blockade in the hypothalamus (pyrexia) and nigrostriatal pathway (extrapyramidal symptoms such as tremor and rigidity). Peripheral blockade can cause changes in skeletal muscle contractility, which may exacerbate stiffness and cause muscle breakdown (with the consequent risk of rhabdomyolysis and renal failure). It must be treated as an emergency (although the syndrome is on a spectrum, and only mild or subclinical features may manifest) and appropriate referral is essential. As far as medical treatment is concerned, the offending antipsychotic must be immediately discontinued. Supportive treatment to ensure cardiovascular stability is the priority. Severe pyrexia may require other specialized cooling treatments. Some patients may actually require mechanical ventilation. It is unclear why some people develop NMS and others do not. It may be triggered on commencing treatment with antipsychotics, increasing dose or other environmental factors such as dehydration or exhaustion. Acute dystonias (A) are also associated with antipsychotic use, but refer to acute muscular spasms. They occur as the result of dopamine blockade in the nigrostriatum. Examples include torticollis and oculogyric crises. They can be extremely painful and frightening and must also be managed as an emergency with anticholinergics. Malignant hyperthermia (B) is a rare autosomal dominated inherited disorder. It produces symptoms similar to NMS but occurs after exposure to inhaled anaesthetics such as halothane and depolarizing muscle relaxants. Serotonin syndrome (D) may easily be confused with NMS, although the rigidity does not occur. It arises as the result of central serotonin release, usually because of serotonergic medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). It is generally less severe than NMS although supportive treatment is also often required. The tyramine reaction (E), sometimes also known as the ‘cheese reaction’, is the result of ingesting tyramine in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.",

    "question": "A 23-year-old man is diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has had florid persecutory beliefs and auditory hallucinations for the past 3 months. In terms of medical history he has poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and is obese. On admission to hospital he was so distressed he required intramuscular rapid tranquilization. On administration of 5 mg of haloperidol, he developed an acute dystonia in his neck muscles which was excruciatingly painful. What would be the most appropriate drug to commence to control his schizophrenia?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aripiprazole",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 294,
    "topic": "Antipsychotics (2)",
    "explanation": "Aripiprazole (A) is a relatively newer antipsychotic. It appears to have less propensity to weight gain than other ‘second-generation’ antipsychotics (such as olanzapine) as well as a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects such as acute dystonias, although it does have its own side effect profile, notably nausea and insomnia. Out of the list, this would therefore be the best choice. Clozapine (B) is an extremely effective antipsychotic but is reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia because of its side effect profile. In this man, therefore, you would want to have trialled at least one (and probably two) other antipsychotics before moving to clozapine. Olanzapine (C) is one of the most commonly used second-generation antipsychotics. It is effective in treating positive symptoms, but has a marked propensity to cause weight gain and may worsen diabetic control. This would clearly be undesirable in this case. Oral haloperidol (D) would still be likely to cause acute dystonia – the patient is clearly very sensitive to these. Extrapyramidal side effects may be caused by either oral or intramuscular formulations. Sertraline (E) is an SSRI, a class of antidepressant, and would therefore not be an appropriate choice of drug in this case.",

He says he believes she is twisting his bones at night, preventing him sleeping and causing him massive pain, through witchcraft.

What Section of the Mental Health Act (MHA) is most likely to be appropriate in this case?",
    "options": [
      "A. Section 135",
      "B. Section 2",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 294,
    "topic": "Schizophrenia and the Mental Health Act",
    "explanation": "While you would be unlikely to need in-depth knowledge of the MHA, many doctors (not just psychiatrists) may be called upon to use these Sections of the Act and it is a good idea to have some basic knowledge about the various ways that people are detained. Section 3 (C) is used to detain people for up to 6 months for treatment. It should not be used unless the person is known to services (and preferably to one of the professionals carrying out the assessment). According to the Department of Health’s code of practice, Section 3 should be used when: ‘the nature and current degree of the patient’s mental disorder, the essential elements of the treatment plan to be followed and the likelihood of the patient accepting treatment on a voluntary basis are already established’. This is therefore the most appropriate Section – an established and successful treatment plan has been in place previously. He will not come into hospital voluntarily and his pattern of relapse is similar to previous episodes. While a Section 2 is arguably less restrictive (being for a shorter period of time), he has also had a recent previous admission under Section. Both Sections require two medical recommendations and an application by an Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP). Section 2 (B) is used to detain people for a maximum of 28 days for assessment. This is most appropriate when the nature and degree of a person’s condition are unclear and an initial phase of assessment is required to establish a longer-term treatment plan. Note it is sometimes mistakenly assumed that because a Section 2 is for assessment (not ‘treatment’) that you cannot prescribe drugs against the person’s will. This is not the case as medications are often an integral part of an assessment, with the response to treatment being a very useful indicator of the nature and degree, as well as prognosis, of someone’s condition. Section 135 (A) refers to a warrant permitting police to search premises and remove patients from those premises. It is required to enter someone’s home when an assessment needs to take place and the patient refuses access. Applications for a Section 135 warrant must be made by the AMHP to a magistrate. Only the police may execute a Section 135 warrant and this must be accompanied by an AMHP and a doctor. Section 4 (D) is an emergency Section used to detain people fulfilling the requirements of the Act in terms of the nature and degree of the disorder and risk. It is used only in exceptional circumstances for emergency application for admission for assessment. It requires an application by an AMHP and only one medical recommendation, and is therefore used when two doctors cannot be found and delay to the assessment is likely to be highly undesirable. People may be detained for up to 72 hours on a Section 4, during which time a second recommendation must be secured in order to convert it to a Section 2. They should not be used unless absolutely necessary. Section 5(2) (E) is another 72-hour section and is the one you as the foundation year doctor are most likely to encounter. It is used for inpatients only (and therefore already would be inappropriate in this case) and is referred to as a ‘holding power’. It can be used by any fully registered medical practitioner (i.e. F2 or above) in charge of a patient’s care (or their deputy) to detain people for a full Mental Health Act assessment to be carried out, and only if it is not practicable to wait for the full assessment to be convened. However, you should never use a Section 5(2) without discussing with a psychiatrist first if possible.",

    "explanation": "Rapid tranquilization should only be used when non-pharmacological methods have failed and the risks to the patient or those around them are sufficiently high. Do not use rapid tranquilization without senior advice. This man is obviously unwilling to take oral medication, which makes (B) an inappropriate choice. Haloperidol decanoate (A) is a depot medication and would therefore not have an immediate effect, making this an inappropriate choice also. While lorazepam may be given as a slow intravenous injection (D), it is more likely to cause difficulties such as respiratory depression using this route, and on a mental health unit there are unlikely to be staff or equipment capable of monitoring this. Propofol (E) is used to induce anaesthesia so clearly would not be an appropriate medication. Lorazepam intramuscularly is a commonly used drug for rapid tranquilization, and this would be a reasonable starting dose. It is often combined with intramuscular haloperidol (not the depot formulation). Patients prescribed rapid tranquilization should be carefully monitored by nursing and medical staff to ensure there is no evidence of respiratory depression or other side effects. Before giving parenteral benzodiazepines, ensure the ward has a supply of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist).",

    "explanation": "Clozapine has been known to cause neutropenia (E) or even agranulocytosis. This can lead to infection and sepsis, which would fit with the clinical picture here. This requires urgent treatment and the clozapine must be immediately stopped. This could also be neuroleptic malignant syndrome from the clinical picture, but the haematology does not particularly fit – you would expect to see raised leukocytes. There have been reports of eosinophilia (A) with the use of clozapine, but the exact mechanisms of this are complex and unclear. It is likely to be related to the side effects of myocarditis or colitis that can sometimes be seen with the use of clozapine. Either way, the clinical picture does not quite fit with this. Thrombocytosis (B) has been reported with clozapine but this would be unlikely to lead to this clinical picture. Similarly, anaemia (C) has occasionally been seen, but the clinical picture is closer to one of sepsis rather than anaemia. A low lymphocyte count (D) may be present as part of an overall decrease in all white blood cells with clozapine, but would be unlikely as an isolated abnormality.",

    ],

    "page": 295,
    "topic": "Chronic schizophrenia",
    "explanation": "This symptom is tardive dyskinesia (TD), which generally occurs in those taking antipsychotics (particularly older depot antipsychotics) over many years. It is distressing as well as socially, if not physically, disabling. There are numerous theories about why it occurs, although none has been universally proven. The best course of action in this case would be to try a gradual decrease in the depot medication (A), particularly as the man has been well for so long. This should be done with extreme caution and under regular medical supervision. Approximately 50 per cent of cases of TD improve. Decreasing the depot may cause an initial worsening of symptoms which should be explained to patients. Starting an anticholinergic (C) is absolutely the wrong thing to do, as these drugs may exacerbate TD, not alleviate it. This does point to the fact that TD is likely to have a different aetiology to parkinsonian side effects of antipsychotics. ‘Second-generation’ antipsychotics such as olanzapine (D) do seem to cause TD at a lower rate than older antipsychotics. However, in this case, the man is firmly against oral medication, and trying to impose this is merely likely to lead to non-compliance and a breakdown in the therapeutic relationship. One should never discontinue antipsychotics abruptly (E) unless there are compelling reasons to do so such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. This can lead to all sorts of difficulties beyond the increased risk of a psychotic relapse, and may in fact worsen the dyskinetic symptoms. Although emotional support (B) should be offered to all patients where it is required or likely to benefit, the most appropriate management that is likely to be beneficial is medication review.",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 296,
    "topic": "Other psychotic disorders",
    "explanation": "This is a classic example of de Clérambault’s syndrome (B), also sometimes known as ‘erotomania’, in which the sufferer, usually a single woman, becomes delusionally convinced that someone of ‘exalted’ (in current society usually famous) status has become infatuated with them. The delusion is often meticulously constructed, as the sufferer can explain why the object of their affection cannot reveal their feelings, although obviously the explanations are often outlandish or bizarre. The syndrome can cause considerable problems for the targeted person. Note this is not the same as stalking, although some stalkers will suffer with this syndrome. It is often, but not always, part of the picture of a schizophrenic illness. Capgras syndrome (A) is another of the delusional misidentification syndromes, in which the sufferer believes that a person close to them has been replaced by a double (or ‘doppelganger’). It is also often part of schizophrenia, but may also be seen in organic brain disease such as dementia. Folie à deux (C) is also known as ‘induced delusional disorder’. It is a rare phenomenon whereby two people in a close relationship (thereby already excluding this as an answer for this question!) develop the same delusional beliefs. It occurs more commonly if the pair have lived together for many years and away from the rest of society. Othello syndrome (D), as the name would suggest, is a syndrome of pathological jealousy. Unlike de Clérambault’s, it is more common in men. The core of the syndrome is that the sufferer believes their partner is being unfaithful, despite their being no evidence for this. The syndrome is important to be able to recognize because of the potential for violence. Sufferers will often go to extreme lengths to try to prove the infidelity, and their subsequent failure usually only serves to increase the belief of their partner’s ability to deceive. Querulant delusions (E) refer to patients with beliefs that lead to sustained and excessive complaints and litigations against authorities. They often end up in lengthy and tangled legal battles.",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 296,
    "topic": "Side effects of antipsychotics",
    "explanation": "This is likely to represent hyperprolactinaemia (C), which is a relatively common side effect of many antipsychotics, and by no means limited to the older antipsychotics. It is caused by dopamine blockade of the tuberoinfundibular pathway which regulates prolactin secretion. Symptoms of raised prolactin include gynaecomastia and sexual dysfunction. It is a significant side effect that must be treated seriously. Ignoring it may lead to poor compliance and, in the long term, sustained prolactin levels may lead to osteoporosis. Alpha-blockade (A) from antipsychotic use may lead to sexual dysfunction but would not explain the gynaecomastia. Drug-induced hepatitis (B) would be an unusual finding with haloperidol but it has been reported. Also, these symptoms would be unlikely to be the ones causing hepatitis to present. New-onset diabetes (D) is unlikely to cause sexual dysfunction at early stages, and gynaecomastia would only develop in the context of chronic kidney disease. This is therefore an unlikely option, especially as haloperidol is far less likely than some of the newer antipsychotics to cause problems with blood sugar. Prostatic hypertrophy (E) is a recognized cause of erectile dysfunction, but there is no reason to suggest that this would be a problem in a young man. Antipsychotics may worsen the symptoms of prostatic hypertrophy if they have significant anticholinergic effects (which haloperidol does not particularly), but this would not explain things adequately in this case.",

    "topic": "Diagnosis of schizophrenia",
    "explanation": "This question refers to the ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, and should not be mistaken with first-rank symptoms, which is a common mistake made. Grandiose delusions (B) are more commonly associated with mania, and as such are not specified in ICD-10 for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Some delusions in schizophrenia, however, can sometimes appear to have a grandiose characteristic, such as believing that the CIA are targeting the individual using brain waves – this would more accurately be described as a ‘persecutory delusion’. Formal thought disorder (A), including neologisms (new words being used), metonyms (existing words used in unusual ways) and tangential thinking (unusual connections made between thoughts) are relatively common in schizophrenia, particularly in the acute stages of the illness. Running commentary (C) is when one or more hallucinatory voices comment continuously on what the patient is doing, for example, ‘he’s walking to the shop now, turning left, over the road, why does he look so stupid when he does that?’. It is strongly suggestive of schizophrenia. For a diagnosis according to ICD-10, the symptoms must have been present for most of the time for a period of at least 1 month, or at some time on most days (D). Thought broadcasting (E), in which the sufferer believes that their thoughts are being transmitted so others can hear them, is also relatively common in schizophrenia. Similar symptoms include thought insertion and thought withdrawal and are sometimes collectively known as symptoms of thought alienation.",

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents in the GP surgery. She is over-talkative and over-familiar with you. It is difficult to get a full history, but it seems for the last 4 weeks she has been elated and experiencing voices telling her that her mother was a descendant of the Virgin Mary and that she is a female ‘second coming’. This was the result of an experiment by the Nazi party who genetically engineered her grandparents. She believes that remnants of the Nazi party are now controlling her arms and legs, which results in her alternately trying to hug you and then kicking out at the desk.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 297,
    "topic": "Classification of psychotic disorders",
    "explanation": "This appears to be a schizoaffective disorder (D) of the manic type. The nature of these disorders is a topic of some debate, but according to ICD-10 they occur when both schizophrenic (in this case delusions of passivity in terms of being controlled by the Nazi party as well as auditory hallucinations) coexist with a diagnosable affective disorder (in this case clear manic symptoms). Both must be present within the same episode for the diagnosis to be made. This is not a classic presentation of hebephrenic schizophrenia (A) in which delusions and hallucinations are fleeting and not predominant, but a shallow and inappropriate affect tends to dominate the clinical picture. Disorganized behaviour and speech are also more prominent. An induced delusional disorder (B) is another term for a ‘folie à deux’ in which a delusion appears to be ‘passed on’ from someone with a psychotic belief to someone close to them, usually in an isolated relationship from the rest of the world. An example would be an isolated couple in which the wife wrongly believes she is pregnant and this belief is then shared by the husband. While many of the symptoms would be consistent with paranoid schizophrenia (C), such as auditory hallucinations, patients tend to have more paranoid delusions. The affective symptoms are also very pronounced and occur at the same time. Schizotypal disorder (E) is considered by some to be a personality disorder. It is characterized by eccentric behaviours and beliefs that may mimic schizophrenia but without any definite psychotic symptoms. Again, the exact nature of this disorder is unclear.",

    "answer": "D",
    "page": 297,
    "topic": "Antipsychotics",
    "explanation": "There is almost no evidence for antipsychotics causing renal failure (D), although of course if they precipitate neuroleptic malignant syndrome then this may lead to renal failure through rhabdomyolysis. Also, most antipsychotics are metabolized hepatically, so dose adjustment even in renal disease is usually not indicated (although there are exceptions such as amisulpride). Akathisia (A), or restlessness, is certainly a recognized and common side effect of antipsychotics, particularly those with a propensity for extrapyramidal side effects. Convulsions (B) can occur with antipsychotic use as they tend to lower the seizure threshold. Clozapine significantly reduces seizure threshold, and seizures are a very real possibility for those taking this drug. Hypotension (C) occurs in antipsychotics with adrenergic blockade properties and is usually dose related. These medications should be titrated initially to prevent sudden hypotension and collapse, particularly in the elderly. Tachycardia (E) is also a recognized side effect of antipsychotics. It may be a portent of other more serious cardiac abnormalities with antipsychotic use, such as cardiac arryhythmias and prolonged QT interval, which may lead to sudden cardiac death.",

Depression with severe psychomotor retardation can lead to dehydration and pressure sores and should be treated urgently. Seasonal affective disorder (A) is characterized by the same psychiatric and biological symptoms that depressive patients face but is associated with the change of season. Depression will be worse in autumn and winter but will usually resolve in the warmer months. Patients may experience a lack of energy, difficulty waking in the mornings and overeating. Dysthymia (B) consists of chronic low grade mood symptoms not amounting to a depressive illness. Symptoms of atypical depression (C) are the opposite of what is experienced in conventional depression. Patients may have symptoms such as weight gain, increased appetite and hypersomnia.

The grade of depression can be classified as mild, moderate or severe, depending on the number and severity of symptoms. Recurrent depressive disorder (B) is associated with repeated episodes of depression but between episodes the patient is euthymic. Cyclothymia (D) is diagnosed where there is persistent instability of mood with a cycle of low grade elevated and depressed mood.

Signs and symptoms of Cushing’s include centripetal obesity, cervical fat pads, plethoric facies and bruising. Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism (C) include cold intolerance, bradycardia, weight gain and depression. Hypothyroidism can also mimic depression with symptoms such as forgetfulness, low energy and an inability to concentrate. Primary hyperparathyroidism (D) results in an increased production of parathyroid hormone as well as an elevated blood calcium level, leading to the symptoms of moans (depression), groans (abdominal symptoms), stones (kidney stones) and bones (osteoporosis).

Delusions in depression are usually ‘mood congruent’, i.e. are understandable in the context of being depressed. Examples include delusions of poverty or low self-worth (A). Delusions in mania are frequently grandiose (B). Bizarre delusions, especially with passivity (C) or thought alienation, are suggestive of schizophrenia. Option (E) is suggestive of de Clérembault’s syndrome which usually occurs in mania or schizophrenia, rarely depression. It is important to distinguish delusions from non-delusional ideation (D) which is not held with subjective certainty.",

Other common symptoms include tremor (E), headache and sleep disturbances. The psychological symptoms of anxiety include intense worries or fear (C), irritability, hypersensitivity to noise and poor concentration.

    "question": "A 46-year-old woman is referred to secondary psychiatric services by her GP. Over the last 6 months she has suffered multiple losses, including the death of her sister and a close friend. She lives alone with few social contacts. She has become extremely withdrawn, and is leaving the house less, stating that she gets ‘terrified that I won’t be able to get back to my house’. She reports that when she does go out, she feels breathless, sweaty and like ‘she might faint and make a fool of myself’. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 319,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of anxiety disorders",
    "explanation": "This is a fairly difficult question, at least in part because anxiety disorders often overlap. It is important, both from a prognostic and management point of view, to accurately identify the type of anxiety disorder, as well as exclude any other co-morbidities, such as depression, which is common in anxiety disorders. As a rule, try to identify the source of the anxiety-provoking stimulus. In this case, it appears to be a fear of leaving the house and being outside, driven by negative thoughts such as ‘I might faint or not be able to get home’. This is extremely suggestive of agoraphobia (A), where the fear focuses on being out of the house, on public transport, in crowds, or other situations that the sufferer views as difficult to escape from. There is nearly always avoidance (e.g. going out less), and ‘anticipatory’ anxiety, where the thought of leaving the house brings on symptoms of anxiety. GAD (B) is characterized by so-called ‘free-floating’ anxiety, where there are persistent symptoms of anxiety (excessive ‘worry’ being particularly common) that are not restricted to any particular stimulus. Sufferers tend to be excessively apprehensive about a widespread range of things. Distinguishing between depression is often difficult. It is worth noting that while the two often coexist, they are undoubtedly separate entities in their own right. OCD (C) would not typically present in this way. There are further questions about OCD later in this section. Panic attacks are common in agoraphobia when people are exposed to the offending stimuli, but this is not the same as panic disorder (D). In the latter, the predominant picture is one of recurrent episodic panic attacks, in which there is usually intense fear of imminent doom, going mad or ‘losing control’. Physical symptoms such as a feeling of choking are also common and hyperventilation is almost always present. Panic disorder arguably has the biggest overlap with agoraphobia. Social phobia (E) is a disorder that consists primarily of excessive worry about social situations, such as speaking in public and feeling ‘scrutinized’. Alcohol misuse is often co-morbid in this disorder, as people may use alcohol as a relaxant in social situations. Sometimes there is a particular fear of losing control of the bladder or bowels or vomiting in public.",

      "A. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)",
      "B. Exposure therapy",
      "C. Lorazepam",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 319,
    "topic": "Management of anxiety disorders",
    "explanation": "Benzodiazepines are often used in the short-term management of anxiety and, despite concerns over their potential for dependence and abuse, they continue to be extensively prescribed. Overall, they should be avoided where possible but may be prescribed in short bursts for severe anxiety, although with caution and preferably with specialist advice. Regardless of this, lorazepam (C) would not be an appropriate choice of benzodiazepines because of its short duration. Diazepam, with a longer half-life, would be a more appropriate choice. CBT (A) is now the mainstay of treatment for many anxiety disorders, including agoraphobia. It seeks to identify automatic negative thoughts and feelings and link them with unwanted behaviours and also identifies more helpful patterns of thoughts and actions. Exposure therapy (B) is a form of CBT in which the sufferer is gradually ‘exposed’ to the anxiety-provoking stimulus in a safe and graded fashion. This would perhaps begin by standing with the front door open for increasing lengths of time, while thoughts and feelings are examined. The length and degree of exposure is then gradually increased. Paroxetine (D) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Although the SSRIs have a confusing array of licenses for different conditions, they all appear to have a beneficial effect in anxiety disorders. Paroxetine has a license for panic disorder so would be a suitable choice here (there is no SSRI with a specific license for agoraphobia). Note that SSRIs do not have an immediate effect and may worsen symptoms in the first few days. Patients should be warned that it may be a few weeks before any benefit occurs. It is now commonly accepted that a dual approach of CBT and medication may be the most superior treatment option, but of course this will not necessarily work for everyone and, most importantly, treatment should be targeted to the needs of the individual. Psychoeducation (E), while a rather vague term, is a critical part of managing anxiety disorders. Common conceptions in sufferers are that they are going mad or may even ‘die’ from their fear and worry. It is extremely important that the nature of anxiety is fully explained to patients. Without this priming, it is far less likely that other treatments will be effective.",

    "explanation": "While the epidemiology of social phobia suggests that men are approximately as likely as women to suffer with social phobia, they are less likely (D) to report symptoms or seek professional advice (as for many other mental health problems). Beta-blockers (A), while they do not have any role in tackling the source of social phobia, are often used for symptomatic relief in unavoidable stressful social situations, such as family gatherings, presenting something at work etc. They should only be used, however, as part of the overall management of social phobia which should include psychological interventions. Genetic factors do play a role in social phobia (B), and possibly even more so than other anxiety disorders. Both population and twin studies confirm this. It is now thought that avoidant personality disorder is aetiologically related to social phobia although more work needs to be carried out on this. While most cases of social phobia are triggered by a significant anxiety-provoking social situation, it may also develop in the absence of such a ‘critical’ event (C). Social phobia usually manifests in the late teens or in the third decade (E). However, as stated above, there is growing recognition of its likely relationship to certain personality types and disorders.",

    "answer": "E",

    "topic": "Generalized anxiety disorder",
    "explanation": "Anxiety and depression are both very common, and both are risk factors for the other. While the symptoms may overlap, particularly in milder cases, this does not imply that one diagnosis ‘trumps’ the other (E). GAD is one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses, with prevalence rates usually quoted in the region of 3 per cent of adults, although when ICD-10 criteria are used it appears to lead to higher prevalence rates than using DSM-IV criteria. It is thought to affect more women than men, even when accounting for lower consultation rates in men (A). GAD is often mistaken for a physical disorder, particularly in the elderly (B). These patients may be started on potentially harmful medications, such as antihypertensives, rate-controlling drugs etc. A thorough history should help prevent this. The converse, of course, is also true (D). Perhaps the most quoted (although by no means the most common) is the patient presenting with ‘anxiety’ who actually has a phaeochromocytoma. Many disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypoglycaemia and cardiac arrythmias, may mimic the symptoms of anxiety. Equally, anxiety may be triggered by physical symptoms, or excessive worry about physical health. Just because GAD is ‘generalized’ this does not mean that it may not be triggered by a particularly stressful life event (C), and in fact this is often the case.",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 320,
    "topic": "Theories of anxiety",
    "explanation": "There are numerous theories of anxiety, but you should be familiar with the basics of the more common theoretical viewpoints. Cognitive theory has been studied extensively in anxiety (A), and looks at the distortions in cognitive processes that people with anxiety appear to hold. These include catastrophizing (‘If I go outside, I’m sure I’ll have a heart attack’) and labelling (‘I am just an awkward, boring person’). The fact that CBT is such an effective treatment for anxiety disorders also provides indirect evidence of the role of cognitive distortions in anxiety. Freud believed that anxiety was the result of intrapsychic, unconscious conflict (B). Broadly speaking, he believed that anxiety occurs when the ego is overwhelmed by different types of conflict or excitation. Most neurobiological studies of anxiety implicate non-dopaminergic pathways (C), particularly noradrenaline, GABA and serotonin. Dopaminergic pathways may be involved in certain anxiety disorders, e.g. OCD. Secure attachment would not lead to anxiety disorders (D) in psychoanalytic theory. Childhood attachment problems, conversely, may lead to the resurgence of anxiety problems in adulthood, particularly around separation. The adaptive theory (E) states that anxiety exists as an evolutionary advantage, commonly referred to as the ‘fight or flight’ response. The Yerkes–Dodson law may be considered an extension of this, where performance plotted against anxiety results in a bell-shaped curve – up to a point, some anxiety may increase performance.",

    "topic": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder (1)",
    "explanation": "OCD, unlike most other anxiety disorders, seems to affect men and women equally (A). The mean age of onset is in the third decade, although there is often a considerable lag of some years before people present for assessment, often because of poor understanding of the nature of the disorder. OCD is probably one of the less common anxiety disorders (B), although it is now thought to be much more common than previous estimates, with figures nowadays at around 2–3 per cent for lifetime prevalence. The fear of contamination is very common in OCD sufferers, but this is an obsessive thought, not a compulsive behaviour (C). Obsessional thoughts consist of recurrent and intrusive words, images, ideas and beliefs that are usually always unpleasant for the sufferer, causing anxiety and distress. They must interfere with the sufferer’s ability to carry out their everyday life. Compulsions represent repetitive behaviours (e.g. hand washing) or mental acts (e.g. counting) usually in response to an obsessional thought. The sufferer feels compelled to carry them out in order to reduce the anxiety provoked by the obsessive thought, although there seldom appears to be any rational connection between the compulsion and how it may reduce the obsessive anxiety. Generally, OCD sufferers attempt to resist compulsive acts as they realize they are maladaptive. However, resistance usually ends in increasing anxiety and eventually sufferers will succumb to the behaviour. So, in this sense, compulsive acts may be both resisted and not resisted (D). The obsessive thoughts in OCD are nearly always unpleasant, or certainly strange and unusual (E).",

    "topic": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder (2)",
    "explanation": "Antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, form the mainstay of the pharmacotherapy of OCD (A). They have significant anti-obsessional properties. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine has also been used to treat OCD as it has a potent serotonergic reuptake blocking action. Also, depression is a common co-morbid condition in OCD which will warrant its own assessment and management. Although it may appear counterintuitive and even cruel to prevent patients from carrying out their rituals, this is the most common psychological approach to treating the condition and is known as exposure and response prevention (B). It is a form of CBT. Beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections in children can occasionally lead to an autoimmune reaction known as ‘PANDAS’ – Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (C). The neuropsychiatric consequences include obsessive–compulsive symptoms and tic disorders. People with OCD could be said to have ‘insight’ into their intrusive thoughts and compulsions (D), they know their beliefs are the result of their own mind, and usually see the thoughts and behaviours as unhelpful or even ridiculous, despite still feeling compelled to follow them. The exception to this is OCD in children, where they often do not have this insight. There appears to be some commonality in the pathogenesis of both OCD and tic disorders. It is thought that this is related to basal ganglia changes (E).",

    "topic": "Somatoform and dissociative disorders",
    "explanation": "These disorders are difficult to understand and research into them is only just beginning to uncover any meaningful answers. Their classification, diagnosis and management is generally regarded to be unsatisfactory. However, there can be no doubt that psychological factors can lead to physical symptoms and vice versa. Broadly speaking, dissociation refers to a loss of integration between consciousness, memory, perception, identity and bodily movements. There are different forms this may take, with amnesia being one of them (A). Of course, amnesia may also have a very obvious, neurological basis following, for example, head trauma. Body dysmorphic disorder is classified as part of hypochondriacal disorders. It involves the persistent preoccupation that one’s own body is in some way disfigured or otherwise abnormal. However, this is considered to be an overvalued idea and is not psychotic (B). One of the problems with the classification and aetiology of somatoform disorders is the wide way in which they may be culturally explained (C). Culture plays a huge part in how these ‘symptoms’ are understood; for instance, ‘trance states’ may be seen as abnormal in Western societies, but in others may be perceived as entirely normal, or even revered. One commonly encounters this kind of disparity in patients from Asian backgrounds complaining of pain ‘all over the body’ which does not appear to have a ‘physical cause’ in Western terms. Hypochondriasis occurs when sufferers have a persistent preoccupation with having a physical disorder for which no physical ‘cause’ can be found. However, this does not mean that there is nothing ‘wrong’ with the patient, as hypochondriasis represents a way of conveying some kind of psychological distress, albeit not in a way that modern medicine has traditionally understood (D). Multiple personality disorder is classified as a dissociative disorder. Despite widespread presence in the media, it is extremely rare and poorly understood (E). It is often used mistakenly as a way of defining schizophrenia in lay terms.",

Other findings on neuroimaging include generalized cerebral atrophy and enlarged ventricles. The caudate nucleus (A) may be slightly smaller in AD but this would not be a particularly important finding and may occur in other forms of dementia. It would also be common in disorders such as Huntington’s disease. Cerebellar atrophy (B) occurs late in AD, but is commonly seen in certain movement disorders, including Wilson’s disease and Friedreich’s ataxia, among others. Atrophy of the frontal lobes (C) may occur in AD, but it is usually a later finding. Primary degeneration at this site is more consistent with one of the frontotemporal dementias, such as Pick’s disease. Periventricular white matter lesions (E) refer to lesions occurring in the non-cortical areas adjoining the ventricles as opposed to subcortical lesions.

    "page": 329,
    "topic": "Management of dementia",
    "explanation": "Compounds which increase the functional levels of acetylcholine (C) in the brain appear to have some effect on cognition in dementia. The compounds currently available block the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and are therefore termed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In some patients (but by no means all) they lead to improvements in activities of daily living, although they have perhaps less direct benefit on memory itself. The drugs are not curative. Drugs which deplete levels of serotonin (A) in the brain would not have an effect on the cognitive symptoms of dementia. In fact, there are no products currently licensed with this mode of action. Drugs of abuse such as ecstasy cause massive release of serotonin (leading to the ‘high’) but there is a subsequent depletion of available serotonin before stores are built back up, leading to the depressive symptoms commonly observed after its use. Drugs increasing dopamine levels in the brain (B) are used in disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, where the neurochemical lesion is a loss of dopaminergic pathways in the substantia nigra. Note that an increase in functional levels of dopamine may lead to psychotic symptoms. Drugs which decrease the levels of histamine in the brain (D), commonly referred to as antihistamines, would not be expected to have a positive effect on cognition, and indeed may cause confusion, particularly in older age. Drugs which decrease the levels of GABA in the brain (E) are usually sedative. The benzodiazepines are the most commonly used. They would not have a positive effect on cognition.",

    "question": "A 79-year-old married woman comes to see her GP with her husband. The husband reports his wife has a history of several months of deteriorating memory and is now forgetting names and faces. He also explains that at times she seems much more lucid, but there are occasions when she becomes very forgetful and confused, sometimes saying there are people sat in the living room with them, which the patient and her husband find distressing. More recently she has developed a tremor in her left hand. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 329,
    "topic": "Differential diagnosis of dementia",
    "explanation": "This is typical history of a patient suffering with Lewy body dementia/dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (B). Lewy bodies are cytoplasmic inclusions that are associated with numerous disorders, including Parkinson’s disease. It accounts for around 5–10 per cent of all dementias. There is a classic ‘triad’ of symptoms in DLB, consisting of visual hallucinations, a fluctuating cognitive impairment and parkinsonism. The fluctuations can be quite marked, with changes seen from day to day or even hour to hour. In this way DLB is often confused with delirium. The hallucinations are usually visual and complex. They are often distressing to the patient, but by no means always. It is not uncommon for patients to calmly state that other people are in the room, for instance sat round the dinner table with them and their spouse. Parkinsonism (which occurs within a year of onset of cognitive difficulties) tends to consist of rigidity and gait difficulties more than tremor. Patients also often have postural hypotension and a risk of falls. DLB has classically been thought to have a more aggressive course than Alzheimer’s, but this could in part be due to how it has been treated in the past – it is now known that these patients have marked and often fatal reactions to antipsychotic agents which are generally contraindicated in patients with DLB. While psychotic symptoms do occur in AD (A), they are less frequent than in DLB (although there have been estimates of them occurring in up to one-third of patients). Delusions tend to be encountered more than hallucinations. Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) (C) occurs in approximately 30 per cent of people with Parkinson’s disease, with a higher incidence with increasing age. In contrast to DLB, in PDD the onset of parkinsonism is over a year before cognitive difficulties. It is important to distinguish between PDD and depression, as the latter is also extremely common in PD. Generally, the cognitive profile is indistinguishable from that of DLB. Pick’s disease (D) is often used interchangeably with the term frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The FTDs are often misdiagnosed, because they tend to present with significant personality and affective symptoms. There is probably a significant familial component and they can present relatively early in the fifth and sixth decades. The syndrome is characterized by ‘frontal’ signs such as disinhibition, aggression, antisociality, or the reverse picture of apathy. Memory tends to be preserved but with significant deficits on specific frontal lobe testing. Vascular dementia (E) may of course present in a wide variety of ways because of the possibility of cerebrovascular disease in any part of the brain. A fluctuating course is not typical of vascular dementia, although a ‘step-wise’ deterioration may be observed.",

      "B. Fluctuating conscious level",
      "C. Low mood",

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 329,
    "topic": "Dementia and depression in older age",
    "explanation": "This question addresses the overlap between dementia and depression and highlights how commonly the two are confused – wrongly diagnosing someone with dementia can have disastrous consequences, particularly if the patient is profoundly depressed. The term ‘pseudodementia’ is seldom used these days, and refers to depression ‘masquerading’ as dementia, although it does still have clinical value it highlights the importance of distinguishing between the two disorders. Depression in older age often presents with cognitive difficulties. Subjective and excessive worrying by the patient over their memory is not characteristic of dementia, and should prompt a more thorough search for other depressive symptoms. Insight is typically lost early in dementia (particularly Alzheimer’s disease), with the majority of patients (although not all), having little insight into or worry over what may be significant cognitive difficulties. In depression, the patient may become extremely preoccupied with their ‘memory’; poor cognitive function in depression is often the result of poor attention and concentration, and in-depth neuropsychological tests which can control for this should reveal no significant memory problems. Delusions (A) are a relatively common feature of both dementia and severe depression. The content of the delusions may be fairly similar, although dementia patients often suffer with delusions of theft and persecution, whereas patients with depression may have delusions with a more ‘nihilistic’ and bizarre quality, such as believing they are rotting or that the devil is punishing them. Fluctuating conscious level (B) is not characteristic of either dementia or depression and should prompt investigation for an acute confusional state (delirium). Low mood (C), while a hallmark of depression, is not enough to diagnose a depressive disorder. Low mood in itself is also common in patients with dementia, affecting possibly the majority of patients with dementia at some point. There are complex and poorly understood interactions between depression and dementia, on both a neuropathological and clinical level – expert assessment should always be sought. Poor verbal fluency (D) is a test that is often used to assess ‘frontal lobe’ functioning. However, it is also extremely reliant on attention and concentration. Typically patients are asked to name as many of a particular thing (such as animals, or words beginning with ‘s’) in 1 minute. Poor performance on verbal fluency would not particularly distinguish between dementia and depression.",

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 330,
    "topic": "Depression in older age (1)",
    "explanation": "Somatization (E), or the displacement of psychological distress such as depression into physical complaints or symptoms, is common in the depressed elderly. This may be a result of older people tending to minimize their experience of sadness and that somatic complaints represent an alternative way of expressing their distress. Also remember that ‘somatic’ complaints may actually also represent real undiagnosed medical problems. Do not dismiss the depressed older person’s complaints of stomach pain at the risk of missing an occult malignancy. Studies have shown that healthy older people are no more at risk of becoming depressed than healthy younger people (D). However, numerous factors that are associated with older age are associated with an increased risk of depression. Possibly the most important of these is medical co-morbidity, particularly chronic long-term illness. Anxiety states (A) are extremely common in depression in older age, and may in fact be the presenting feature. Deliberate self-harm (B) is societally often seen as an act of the younger generations – this is a dangerous misconception. Older people may also undertake acts of deliberate self harm and remember these may not be associated with depression, but may occur in the context of severe medical disability, pain or loneliness. In fact, when older people do engage in acts of self-harm, this is usually with a high level of suicidal intent and must be taken extremely seriously. Depression is certainly not less common in residential care settings (C) than in the general community. In nursing homes the rate may be up to three times that of the community.",

Which of the following statements is false?",

      "A. A serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant would be a safe choice",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 330,
    "topic": "Depression in older age (2)",
    "explanation": "ECT (C) is an important treatment for severe depression. It has a chequered history and many opponents. There are very few, if any, absolute contraindications to using ECT, and a stroke from 3 years ago would not be considered a barrier to treatment. Relative contraindications include heart disease, raised intracranial pressure and poor anaesthetic risk. SSRIs (A) are generally thought to be safe in renal impairment. However, it would be important to monitor renal function and urea and electrolytes, particularly as older people and those with renal impairment are at a higher risk of developing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) from SSRIs, leading to hyponatraemia. Benzodiazepines (B) are not recommended for use in older age, and depression itself would certainly not be an indication for their use. They may cause increased confusion and falls. Lithium (D), while it may be appropriate in severe refractory depression, would not be first line in older age, and certainly not in someone with end-stage renal disease, as it is renally excreted and now thought to be directly nephrotoxic. The relationship between chronic disease, e.g. diabetes (E) and depression, is well established.",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 330,
    "topic": "Depression in older age (3)",
    "explanation": "This question requires you to have some knowledge about both the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (‘MCA’) and the Mental Health Act 2007 (‘MHA’). It is important that all healthcare professionals have knowledge relevant to these acts as far as they may be required to use them – the MHA and the MCA are not just the jurisdiction of psychiatrists, and all doctors should know the fundamentals of assessing capacity as it is one of the cornerstones of informed consent. There are numerous guides available giving appropriate levels of information. Broadly speaking, the MCA should not be used to detain someone if they have a mental illness. It may be used to treat someone if that treatment is in their best interests and they lack capacity to decide that treatment themselves. However, if there is a clear indication that the person is suffering with a mental disorder, is refusing treatment and especially if they pose a risk to themselves or others, the MHA is likely to be the correct act to use. In this case, a Section 3 (C) of the MHA would be the most appropriate as the patient is known, and is presenting with similar symptoms to previous admissions. This allows for treatment for up to 6 months. Detaining ‘under common law’ (A) was used prior to the MCA coming into force to treat people lacking capacity. If someone has capacity, you cannot treat them against their will (although there are some unusual exceptions to this where the MHA may be used). One cannot do nothing in this case (B) as the man is at risk, both to himself and possibly others. Without any legal framework neither he nor those around him have access to appropriate safeguards (e.g. a tribunal). A Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DOLS) assessment (D) is part of the MCA and applies when someone’s liberty is being deprived rather than restricted – this does not apply here. There is no evidence here that IM medication would be the most appropriate course of action (E). Nursing and other management techniques should be employed. IM medication should usually be a last resort and there is nothing in the vignette to say he will not take oral medication.",

    "answer": "C",
    "page": 331,
    "topic": "Mania in older age",
    "explanation": "When ‘late-onset’ bipolar disorder occurs (C) (commonly taken to be above the age of 50), the manic phase tends to present latently, often many years following several depressive episodes. Not every manic elderly person should be detained under the Mental Health Act (A) – each individual must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Bipolar disorder does not disappear later in life (B). In fact, it has been suggested by some that the frequency of episodes actually tends to increase in people with long-standing bipolar disorder as they get older. There is probably insufficient evidence, however, to be able to say this with much certainty. Unipolar mania (D) does occasionally occur but, as with younger patients, is fairly unusual. Physical co-morbidity (E) most certainly does have an impact on the course of manic syndromes in older age, with many now supporting the diagnostic entity of ‘vascular-mania’ in a similar way to the emergence of ‘vascular depression’. Mania in older age is highly correlated with neurological and cerebrovascular disease.",

    "topic": "Hallucinations in older age",
    "explanation": "This is a very typical description of Charles Bonnet syndrome (A). This is a syndrome of complex, vivid visual hallucinations that occur in people with severe visual impairment (e.g. macular degeneration). Insight is retained and there are no other symptoms (unless there is a co-morbid diagnosis). It is usually self-limiting but there is no specific treatment as such, although explaining the cause of the symptoms is often reassuring. The other options are all eponymous syndromes related to psychiatry. Cotard’s syndrome (B) is usually seen in psychotic depression, and is a delusional state in which the sufferer believes a part of their body (or their whole being) has ceased to exist. Ekbom’s syndrome (C), or delusional parasitosis, is the delusional (not hallucinatory) belief that animals or insects are crawling below the sufferer’s skin. It is a difficult syndrome to treat because of the fixity of patients’ beliefs that their problem is a physical one. Sufferers may engage in highly dangerous methods to rid themselves of the ‘parasites’, such as digging them out with instruments or using highly corrosive cleaning materials on the skin. Fregoli’s syndrome (D) is a form of delusional misidentification, in which sufferers believe that complete strangers are actually people well known to them in disguise.

    "page": 331,
    "topic": "Psychotic symptoms in older age",
    "explanation": "VLOSLP (E), despite its unwieldy name, is considered by many old age psychiatrists to be an extremely well-circumscribed syndrome, although the literature is still somewhat confusing. This used to be termed ‘late paraphrenia’ but this term is currently not in vogue and probably therefore best avoided. VLOSLP typically affects women more than men and sufferers often have no other personality or cognitive problems. Delusions can take any form, but it is very common for sufferers to describe ‘partition delusions’, in which solid structures become permeable to people or substances – in this case radiation from the neighbours. Unfortunately, the response to antipsychotics (A) tends to be relatively poor. There may be some success but they are unlikely to alleviate all symptoms. Sufferers tend to live alone and be extremely lonely, so befriending or more formal psychological intervention may offer some relief. Rehousing (B) is often attempted because of incessant complaints from sufferers, and usually before these patients have come to the attention of psychiatric services. However, it is almost always only a stop-gap measure, and symptoms usually reappear very quickly, even in a new home. The cough (C) may be an incidental finding but it is unlikely to be a delusional elaboration – coughs being a common symptom. It would be important not to overlook this, as it may represent something more sinister (particularly given the weight loss). There is little to suspect a dementia here (D), particularly given the relatively rapid onset and the high performance on MMSE.",

    "topic": "Alcohol misuse in older age",
    "explanation": "There are several misconceptions concerning alcohol use and misuse in older people. Moderate use, harmful use and dependence on alcohol are all seen in older age, and are not uncommon. Alcohol should routinely be asked about when assessing older people, and it is important that you learn the skills of how to do this. Alcohol dementia (D) is a complex phenomenon as it may be the result of different pathologies. Prolonged and heavy alcohol misuse is associated with irreversible cognitive problems. Alcohol use may predispose to cerebrovascular disease, head injury (and subsequent Alzheimer’s disease) as well as having a directly toxic effect on the brain. Korsakoff’s syndrome may also occur with prolonged use, which in itself is an amnestic syndrome. Alcohol dependence may certainly arise de novo in older people (A). It may be precipitated by stressful life events. However, this does not mean that genetics (C) do not play a role in the aetiology of alcohol dependence in older people, whether this is because of dependence from a younger age extending into older age, or arising de novo. Alcohol problems are often covert in older people (B). Cognitive problems may also lead to a poor recollection of alcohol use. The consequences of alcohol misuse may be concentrated upon (e.g. recurrent falls) rather than the alcohol use itself. There is still a male preponderance in alcohol problems in older age (E).",

    "explanation": "Anxiety disorders in older age behave fairly similarly to anxiety disorders in younger patients. However, there are certain things to bear in mind. One is that, in a similar way to depression, anxiety in older people may focus around issues related to physical health (E). Also, while both CBT and antidepressants are effective (A), medication may need to be tailored to the individual with more care – SSRIs may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, and tricyclics may exacerbate falls because of their anticholinergic effects. There would be no reason to treat anxiety disorders in older people as inpatients (B) unless there were compelling issues around risk – this is true regardless of age. The demographic distribution of anxiety disorders remains as it is for younger people, with a preponderance of diagnoses among women (C). Poor physical health most definitely would be a risk factor for developing an anxiety disorder. The physical health problem may directly exacerbate symptoms of anxiety (such as cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory disease) or increasing poor physical health itself may cause anxiety problems (D).",

    "answer": "B",
    "page": 332,
    "topic": "unusual causes of cognitive impairment",
    "explanation": "Cerebral malignancy (B) (whether primary or secondary) may present with memory loss and dysphasia. Frontal lobe tumours, because of their location, may lead to very few other localizing signs, so do not presume the absence of either soft or obvious neurological signs rules out the presence of brain malignancy. The biochemical abnormalities show hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and a normal potassium level. This would be consistent with brain malignancy, as many tumours may produce parathyroid-related peptide which will lead to hypercalcaemia, although this would commonly be from secondary metastatic disease in the brain from a haematological malignancy or solid tumour such as breast or lung. New presentation of hypercalcaemia should always prompt suspicion for malignancy. The hyponatraemia similarly results from inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH). This may result directly from an ADH-secreting tumour (or one secreting atrial natriuretic peptide), which again is often lung but may also be head and neck tumours. Unexplained weight loss should also raise the possibility of occult malignancy. Addison’s disease (A), or primary adrenal failure, leads to a loss of all steroids produced from the adrenal cortex. It is commonly an autoimmune condition and therefore affects women far more than men. The typical biochemical pattern includes hyperkalaemia and hyponatraemia due to the loss of aldosterone, as well as hypercalcaemia. Memory loss is not often described, although depression and fatigue are certainly common. Cushing’s disease (C) is associated with increased levels of circulating glucorticoids and low potassium. Weight loss would be very uncommon, with weight gain usually occurring in these patients. Depression and fatigue are more common than memory problems as such. Cushing’s disease (not Cushing’s syndrome, which is the term used to describe increased levels of circulating glucorticoids regardless of the cause) is caused by endogenous increased glucorticoid production, usually from an adrenocorticotrophic hormone-producing adenoma or other tumours. Hyperthyroidism (D) would be unlikely to cause memory problems, and the biochemical markers do not fit with this disease. Anxiety (or more specifically, the physical constellation of symptoms associated with anxiety) is a much more common manifestation of hyperthyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism (E) would certainly result in raised calcium, but would be unlikely to cause a low sodium.",

    "question": "A 90-year-old woman is in hospital with late-stage colon cancer which has metastasized. She has been remarkably well all her life before being diagnosed with cancer. She lost her husband 3 years ago but has a supportive family. On the ward, she develops a chest infection. The consultant wants to start her on antibiotics, but she says she does not want them. The consultant asks for a psychiatric opinion, worried that she is depressed. However, the psychiatrist reports she is not depressed and is fully competent to make this decision and is choosing how to die as she wishes. What ethical concept is best described here?",
    "options": [
      "A. Autonomy",
      "B. Beneficence",
      "C. Capacity",
      "D. Justice",
      "E. Non-maleficence"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 333,
    "topic": "Ethical considerations in older age",
    "explanation": "Ethical questions seldom have ‘one single best’ answer but you are asked here to describe which best fits the description. Autonomy (A) refers to the ethical concept of the right to make one’s own decisions. In patients with capacity to make the decision in question, autonomy must be respected. This is not the same as necessarily autonomy being followed, as there may be examples when other ethical considerations will override autonomy, such as when there is significant risk to the public etc. In this case, the woman is making a decision, with full capacity, that she does not want any further treatment. Beneficence (B) refers to acting in the best interest of the patient, or performing acts or making decisions to benefit the patient. In this case, it is not straightforward – who are we to decide in this case what is in the patient’s best interests? She may, of course, be made much more comfortable if treated with antibiotics, but equally she may be profoundly distressed if she were treated when she did not want this. In fact, as the woman has been deemed to have capacity, it would be in direct contravention of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to treat her against her wishes. Capacity (C), as we can see above, is central to this question. However, it is a legal concept rather than an ethical one per se. Justice (D) refers to ‘fairness’ for example balancing the needs of the individual against the wider needs of society etc. This is not particularly relevant here, although the needs of the family may need to be considered. However, it is important to note that if capacity continues, the needs of the family, while important to be known, would never ‘trump’ the decision of the patient. Non-maleficence (E) is almost analogous to the mantra of ‘first do no harm’ and refers to the obligation of practitioners to not do anything to bring about harm, pain or suffering. Again, this is not straightforward in this case. It could be argued that not treating her would cause significant pain, but equally the psychological distress felt by treating against her wishes may be much worse. Ethical questions are difficult, and there is often no one ‘right answer’. It is often a complex balancing act, in which many people may be involved. You should never act beyond your competence in ethical decisions – always ask for help if needed.",

      "A. Antipsychotics are the drugs of choice for behavioural disturbance in dementia",
      "B. Fat-soluble drugs, such as diazepam, will have a longer duration of action because of increased body fat in older people",

      "D. Older people are less sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines",
      "E. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) will not cause constipation in older people because of a general increase in gut motility"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 333,
    "topic": "use of medications in older age",
    "explanation": "As we age, there is a general increase in our body fat, with less body water. This leads to an increased volume of distribution. For drugs that are fat-soluble, such as diazepam (B), this means there will be a general increase in the duration of action. This is important when using these drugs as it will become easier to inadvertently overdose the patient. Antispsychotics (A) have been shown to increase all-cause mortality in patients with dementia and are therefore to be avoided wherever possible. Also, people with Lewy body dementia are particularly susceptible to antipsychotics and should definitely not be prescribed other than in exceptional circumstances. There are a range of alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for behavioural symptoms of dementia. You will encounter this during your time in acute hospitals on a regular basis – do not start patients with dementia on an antipsychotic drug without seeking senior advice. Lithium (C) should be given at lower doses, but this is because of decreased renal function in older people – lithium is an inorganic ion and is not metabolized by the liver. Older people are generally much more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines (D) and they should be used extremely cautiously. They are much more likely to cause falls, respiratory depression or paradoxical excitation. There is a general decrease in gut motility in older people, not increase. TCAs (E) also decrease gut motility, meaning that there is a much greater incidence of constipation – you should always assess older people for constipation as a cause of confusion.",

    "explanation": "While many people with personality disorder do have difficulty with impulse control (A), it is not necessary for a diagnosis. ICD-10 specifies that the individual’s inner experiences or behaviour must be manifest in more than one of the following areas (but not necessarily all). \n• Cognition\n• Affectivity\n• Control over impulses\n• Manner of relating to others.\n  This behaviour cannot be limited to one situation or stimulus, but must pervade across the individual’s inner and social worlds and must be inflexible, maladaptive and dysfunctional (B). There must be distress, either to the individual themselves, their social environment, or usually both (C). The disorder must have arisen during late childhood or adolescence (D), and should be ‘stable’ and of long duration. Changes occurring within adulthood themselves do not qualify as personality disorders, but may represent personality change, usually as the result of severe and enduring stress. An organic cause cannot be responsible for the disorder (E) – there is a separate diagnostic category for ‘organic personality disorder’ – an example would be frontal lobe injury.",

    "topic": "Theories of personality",
    "explanation": "There are a bewildering number of personality theories and constructs. However, it is becoming increasingly accepted that five (not three) factors can adequately describe personality. These can be remembered with the mnemonic ‘OCEAN’ - Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraverson/intraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism (D). Kretschmer originally described three body-types that he believed were associated with specific personality types (A). However, empirical research has not shown any reliable link between the two. Freud hypothesized that for normal personality development, an individual must successfully pass through various developmental stages of ‘the libido’, namely oral, anal and genital (B). Failure at one, e.g. anal, would result in personality difficulties in later life (in this case, obsessional traits). Idiographic personality theories are concerned with the uniqueness of every individual (C), compared to nomothetic theories in which personality is thought to be made up of differing degrees of stable factors, and individuals differ only in the amount of each of these factors that they possess. The environment as well as our genetic makeup of course are responsible for how our personality develops (E) – this has been backed up by numerous twin and other studies.",

People with mental illness are more likely to be the victims of violence than perpetrators of it. Co-morbid substance misuse is positively correlated with dangerousness (B). The aetiology of this relationship, however, is extremely complex. Juvenile delinquency (C) may predict a tendency towards psychopathy (which itself is related to dangerousness). This forms part of one of the most commonly used assessment tools for psychopathy, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PCL-R), as part of Factor 2 – ‘Socially Deviant Lifestyle’. (D) and (E) are also part of the PCL-R for psychopathy, but fall into Factor 1 of the checklist – ‘Aggressive Narcissism’.",

    "explanation": "The most appropriate option is to discharge her with follow-up from her key worker (D). She is currently in a service designed specifically to cope with the difficulties people with personality disorder face. There is little evidence here that an inpatient admission would be helpful (A). People with borderline personality disorder often feel chronically abandoned and not listened to, so while admission may make both the clinician and patient feel safer, it is seldom useful in the long term. People with personality disorder often use admissions as justification for their behaviours. Firm boundaries coupled with thoughtful empathy are necessary to help these individuals. Again, like their being no justification for admission, there is no evidence for using the MHA (and indeed it is unlikely she would be detainable). Therefore (B) and (C) would not be appropriate – and in fact one could not use Section 5(2) in any case as this is only applicable to current inpatients, not to patients in accident and emergency. Banning the patient from accident and emergency (E) will only serve to confirm the woman’s feelings of abandonment – the behaviour is likely to escalate rather than stop, and will just occur in another department where she is not known, which is potentially much more dangerous.",

Antidepressants (A) similarly may have a role, particularly in terms of helping with impulse control. However, as with antipsychotics, the use of psychotropic medication alone is almost certain to be a failure without consistent and long-term psychological interventions. Dynamic psychotherapy (C) is certainly used for the management of many types of personality disorder, including emotionally unstable. Benzodiazepines (D) should be used with extreme caution in people with borderline personality disorder because of their potential for dependence. Group psychotherapy (E) has been used for many years in the management of individuals with personality disorder.

    "explanation": "While many of Freud’s ideas have fallen out of favour, it is indisputable that he provided psychiatry and the emerging field of psychotherapy with a new systematic way of viewing the mind and behaviour. Nearly all of the fundamentals of psychotherapy can be traced back to his work. His structural model sought to understand our instincts and drives and divided the mind into three parts: the id, the ego and the superego. The ego (B) refers to the mainly conscious part of the mind that composes rational thinking and balances the needs of the individual against the demands of the outside world. The id (C) refers to the mainly unconscious part of the mind that contains innate instincts such as sexuality and aggression. It is not a term widely used in psychiatric literature these days. The superego (E) is analagous to what we might call ‘conscience’ and contains our moral rules. Freud believed it developed from our identification with authority figures and is part conscious, part unconscious. The genital stage (A) is one of Freud’s stages of early development that must be passed through successfully to avoid problems later in life. The other stages were anal and oral. It is his work on early development that has perhaps been the most abandoned in current psychoanalytic thinking. The Oedipus complex (D), in the strictest sense from Freud, took place between the ages of 3 and 5 and is concerned with the child’s realization of their gender, their resentment of never possessing what the opposite parent has and their jealousy of the parental relationship. Freud’s model was intensely phallocentric however, and it has been modified by current psychoanalytic theorists to include both genders.",

    "question": "A 42-year-old woman suffers a painful breakup with her long-term partner after finding him in bed with another man. She finds the situation, including telling her friends and family, extremely difficult. One year later she is asked how she is feeling. She denies any knowledge of seeing her partner being unfaithful and says ‘oh, we just had our differences, you know, there’s no hard feelings’. What is this form of defence mechanism called?",

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 354,
    "topic": "Defence mechanisms (1)",
    "explanation": "Denial and repression may often be confused. Defence mechanisms are fundamentally unconscious strategies employed by an individual to cope with reality and stress. They are not always maladaptive (see below). Denial (A) refers to a refusal to accept reality despite all logical evidence. It refers mainly to events that are currently occurring in the individual’s life. Repression (D) involves the unconscious exclusion of painful desires, thoughts or fears. In this case, the woman has unconsciously hidden the memory of seeing her partner in bed with another man in order to avoid reliving the intense pain this caused her. Idealization (B) involves perceiving another individual as having more positive traits or qualities than they may actually possess. It is actually part of the complex defence of splitting (E), in which the individual perceives things as either all ‘good’ (idealization), or all ‘bad’ (devaluation). Splitting can often be seen in borderline personality disorder, but here it is often wrongly defined as the intentional action by individuals with borderline personality disorder of turning people (usually staff) against each other. Regression (C) is another defence mechanism whereby the individual reverts to an earlier stage of development in order to avoid stressful events. It is thought to occur in those stuck at a particular stage of psychosexual development. For example, someone stuck at the oral phase may react to stress by eating or smoking excessively.",

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 354,
    "topic": "Defence mechanisms (2)",
    "explanation": "Sublimation (E) refers to transforming negative emotions or situations into positive feelings or behaviours and is classified as a ‘mature’ defence mechanism. Many artists are considered to have used this defence mechanism in order to ‘sublimate’ their nihilistic feelings about themselves and the world. Acting out (A) refers to the enactment of strong feelings that may have been stirred up during therapy, but enacted outside the therapy session. It is often destructive, for example the therapeutic investigation of emotional abuse that had been previously repressed may lead to feelings of anger that may be taken out on people close to the individual. It is not ‘cathartic’ and is usually unhelpful and possibly disastrous for ongoing therapy. Dissociation (B) refers to the modification of one’s personality or identity in order to avoid distress. In severe forms it may present as the controversial ‘multiple personality disorder’. This may result in a dissociative disorder, such as dissociative amnesia or fugue. Projection (C) is a defence mechanism used to decrease anxiety by ascribing one’s own thoughts, fears, attributes or emotions to the external world, usually another person, while denying them as one’s own. For example, a woman really dislikes her male co-worker. However, instead of addressing this, she projects this feeling by the belief that the co-worker dislikes her while saying she herself does not have a problem with him. Projective identification (D) can be thought of as a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ whereby in projected emotions or feelings, the recipient begins to alter their behaviour in order to make the behaviour ‘real’. Thus in the example above, the projective identification may lead to the co-worker actually starting to dislike the woman in question, whereas previously he may have had no problem with her.",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 354,
    "topic": "Types of psychotherapy (1)",
    "explanation": "CBT (A) is now the most prescribed form of psychotherapy in the NHS. It developed from both cognitive and behavioural models. It is usually short-term and used to address a specific problem. It focuses on the ‘here and now’ to a much greater extent than psychodynamic psychotherapy. It is very pragmatic, aiming to alleviate suffering and develop coping strategies, rather than necessarily getting to the ‘root’ of problems, although the therapist will often try and uncover ‘core beliefs’ the individual may hold about themselves and the world. Counselling (B) is a supportive therapy that aims to give individuals a space to discuss their problems, without usually offering advice. This is not to say that counsellors are not highly skilled. However, they do not usually deal with severe mental illness or pervasive personality problems. Mindfulness therapy (C) is a relatively new modality of therapy that shares similarities with CBT but combines cognitive theories with mindfulness stress reduction, which has demonstrated efficacy in relapse prevention for major depression. It has been successfully trialled enough that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have recommended it for those with three or more episodes of major depression. Music therapy (D) refers to numerous forms of therapy in which music is used in various ways to establish and explore a therapeutic relationship with the goal of improving psychological health. Psychodynamic therapy (E) is the most traditional form of psychotherapy, with its origins in the work of Sigmund Freud. At its basic level, psychodynamic (also known as psychoanalytic) therapy tends to be longer-term therapy, looking at deep-rooted problems as a result of past trauma or stresses, including in the individual’s childhood development. There are numerous techniques employed in this method of therapy, including free association, dream interpretation and the analysis of the ‘transference‘ of the individual.",

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "page": 355,
    "topic": "Types of psychotherapy (2)",
    "explanation": "Systemic therapy (E), also known as family therapy, is an umbrella term for a group of models, theories and techniques in which the relationships between individuals (i.e. in systems) are explored. In this way the focus is very different from traditional psychoanalysis, although the two fields are in many ways seeing a growing trend of learning from each other. Family therapy incorporates many different theoretical models, but the fundamental principles are to address issues around relationships. Examples of types of family therapy include narrative therapy, solution-focused therapy and strategic family therapy. Cognitive analytical therapy (A) developed later than CBT and was intended to be used in a time-limited fashion to make treatment available in resource-tight environments like the NHS. It combines techniques (as the name implies) from both cognitive and analytical schools, and seeks to identify chains of events that maintain problems, such as self-harming. Dialectical behaviour therapy (B) is a model that has been developed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. It combines elements of CBT along with elements of distress tolerance and mindfulness. It fundamentally seeks to redress the relationship between client and therapist, where the latter is seen as an ally in the individual’s struggles rather than an adversary. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (C) is another relatively new technique used primarily in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. While it still remains somewhat controversial, the premise of the technique is that distressing memories are relived while another stimulus is being applied (such as therapist-led lateral eye movements). In this way, the distressing memories are thought to be replaced by more positive memory networks. Play therapy (D) is a form of psychodynamic therapy employed in children, using creative and imaginary plan to explore intrapsychic distress.",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "page": 355,
    "topic": "Cognitive behavioural therapy (1)",
    "explanation": "Cognitive therapy seeks to address individual’s false beliefs about themselves and the world around them. People with depression often suffer with these beliefs more than people without depression (although people with personality disorders will often also share some of these beliefs). This represents a core negative belief (C), which are central ideas about one’s self and represent ‘absolute truths’ by the individual. Core beliefs can of course also be positive, but these tend to disappear with the onset of disorders like depression. Arbitrary inference (A) is a type of cognitive distortion in which the individual jumps to a conclusion without having the necessary evidence. For example, ‘if my friend doesn’t pick up the telephone, it must be because they don’t like me’. Catastrophizing (B) is another distortion in which the individual focuses on the worst possible outcome. For example, ‘I overcooked the potatoes, the dinner is ruined and everyone will laugh at me’. Generalization, another distortion (D), occurs when the individual takes one example or incident and applies it to wide generalizations, for example, a man arriving 5 minutes late for his therapy session, stating ‘I’m forever being late, I’m hopeless’. Minimization (E) is a distortion in which positive or successful outcomes by the individual are minimized (and ‘poor’ outcomes conversely are usually maximized). For example, ‘so what that I got 89 per cent on my test, it was only a fluke’.",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "page": 355,
    "topic": "Choice of psychotherapy",
    "explanation": "CBT (B) is the most evaluated and recognized form of psychotherapy for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). One of the core concepts of CBT in OCD is challenging the idea of ‘magical thinking’ in which OCD sufferers believe that they will either have to act on their distressing thoughts or feelings or indeed that they have acted on them in the past. The treatment may also involve ‘exposure and response prevention’ therapy in which the individual is exposed to a stimulus that will provoke their obsessions but are prevented from performing their compulsions which would normally decrease their anxiety. Art therapy (A) would not be an appropriate choice here. Art therapy is not limited to those with artistic ‘ability’ but uses artistic expression as a complementary means of conveying emotions and distress to solely verbal communication. There is nothing in the vignette to suggest that the problems that John is experiencing are the result of discord within his relationship, and therefore family therapy would not be the first choice here (C). Of course, OCD may lead to relationship difficulties and this must also be addressed. Involvement of partners and other close relations in therapy may be an extremely useful way of ‘externalizing’ the problem so the individual is not ‘blamed’ for the behaviours. While John may have deep-seated issues that have precipitated his OCD, there is less evidence that psychodynamic therapy is an effective treatment, and it is certainly likely to be more costly and more time consuming. If there was evidence of previous maladaptive patterns of behaviour or relationships then it may become a more viable option. Watchful waiting (E) is certainly not the right thing to do in this case, as there is obvious distress. Of course, a full assessment is needed to confirm the diagnosis before forging ahead with treatment, but delaying will almost certainly not improve the situation. Psychoeducation (D, although labelled psychoanalytic therapy in the options, the explanation references psychoeducation which aligns better with standard OCD treatment adjuncts), in which OCD is gently and fully explained to the patient, is often a useful adjunct to other treatments.",

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "page": 356,
    "topic": "Cognitive behavioural therapy (2)",
    "explanation": "Certain cognitive and behavioural techniques may be very useful in dementia (D), both for people with dementia and their carers. It should not be assumed that cognitive impairment will automatically exclude people with dementia from benefiting from these therapies and techniques. CBT is often employed by mental health professionals without a full qualification under supervision from a qualified CBT therapist (A). This is an important part of training and as long as there is adequate supervision it is an acceptable and beneficial form of treatment. Many mental health professionals employ CBT ‘techniques’ in their everyday management and engagement with patients without this constituting ‘therapy’ as such. It is a common misconception that CBT does not make reference to early experiences (B). Although the basis of therapy is not to relate current methods of interaction with those from childhood, the CBT therapist may look at earlier experiences when trying to discover ‘core beliefs’ that the client holds about themselves. The evidence suggests that, on the whole, CBT is more effective than medication for generalized anxiety disorder (C). The effects of both are probably additive, with the most success being for a combined approach of CBT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. While CBT is commonly conducted with just one client and therapist (E), there is no reason that family members may not be invited to sessions and in fact may even act as co-therapists in certain situations.",

    "explanation": "Time zone change syndrome (B) is characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep as well as daytime fatigue. Feelings of apathy and irritability may also ensue. Physical symptoms may manifest as altered appetite, muscle aches or headaches. Shift work disorder (A) occurs in patients who conduct shift work; patients who constantly change day/night shift patterns are particularly susceptible to insomnia or hypersomnia. Patients may present with physical symptoms rather than a sleep disorder. Irregular sleep-wake syndrome (C) is characterized by sleeping at irregular times. The disruption of the circadian rhythm leads to insomnia and frequent naps during the daytime. Medical associations include: Alzheimer’s disease, head injury and hypothalamic tumours. DSPS (D) occurs when sleep begins late, leading to difficulties in waking up. Patients may adapt to the condition by taking evening or night jobs. Advance sleep phase syndrome (E) is the opposite of DSPS with early sleep occurrence and early awakening. It is more common in elderly patients.",

When wakened by the jerks there is a characteristic feeling of falling into space. Rhythmic movement disorder (A) is characterized by the repetitive movement of the head before sleep and is sustained into sleep. It is most common in young children and prevalence declines with age. Somniloquy (B), also known as sleep talking, is primarily a condition of childhood. It is associated with the utterance of words or sounds during sleep with no distinguishable meaning. Nocturnal leg cramps (C) causes the sufferer to awaken due to painful muscular tension in the foot or calf. The condition is associated with diabetes, pregnancy and arthritis. Somnambulism (E), or sleep walking, causes patients to arise during sleep and execute activities usually performed during the day.",

    "explanation": "Bulimia and anorexia nervosa, while distinct conditions, share certain features in common. However, the hallmark of bulimia nervosa is recurrent episodes of overeating, or ‘bingeing’, involving the consumption of large quantities of food over a short time (D). This is followed by efforts to control weight, often by vomiting, using appetite suppressants and periods of starvation. A fear of fatness (A) occurs in both anorexia and bulimia. Amenorrhea (B), while it may occur in bulimia, is a diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. Equally, having a low weight (C) is a feature of both disorders (but not diagnostic for bulimia, in which weight may be normal or even increased). For a diagnosis of anorexia, sufferers must be at least 15 per cent below expected body weight. Self-induced vomiting (E) is very common in bulimia nervosa, but equally occur in anorexia in an attempt to control weight.",

Wernicke’s encephalopathy is defined by the classic triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. Korsakoff’s syndrome is characterized by chronic anterograde amnesia. On examination, peripheral neuropathy (B) is typically characterized by sensory loss in the lower extremities, absent tendon reflexes and weakness of the affected limbs. Marchiafava–Bignami disease (C) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by corpus callosum demyelination associated with chronic alcoholism.

It is diagnosed on endoscopy after the patient complains of long-standing heartburn. There is a risk that the Barrett’s oesophagus may progress to adenocarcinoma. Alcoholic liver disease (A) exists as a spectrum of liver pathology: it begins with fatty change and progresses to alcoholic hepatitis in heavy drinkers. Cirrhosis may arise in alcoholics after 10–30 years of persistent use. Acute gastritis (B) is defined as the inflammation of the stomach mucosa and is caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite are characteristic features. Mallory–Weiss tears (D) arise as a result of an alcoholic binge which triggers a vomiting episode. Continued vomiting can cause an oesophageal tear associated with haematemesis. Alcohol is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis (E).

    "explanation": "The patient is suffering from delirium tremens due to alcohol withdrawal. Delirium tremens usually presents 24 hours to 1 week after drinking cessation and patients may experience marked confusion, visual and auditory hallucinations with autonomic instability (sweating, a raised pulse and blood pressure). Oral chlordiazepoxide (A) is the most appropriate drug to use in this situation. It reduces the severity of symptoms and reduces the risk of seizures. IV chlordiazepoxide (D) or diazepam (E) would only be used if the oral route was unavailable. Any person presenting with alcohol withdrawal should also receive high dose intravenous thiamine, not oral thiamine (C) which is poorly absorbed. Antipsychotics (B) should be used only if psychotic symptoms are persistent.",

    "explanation": "Olanzapine (D) is an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic. These drugs are the usual first line choice for treating psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia and generally cause fewer extrapyramidal side effects compared to older antipsychotic drugs. However, they are not without side effects and most are associated with weight gain and metabolic changes. Chlorpromazine (A) is an example of a ‘typical’ or first-generation antipsychotic, and in fact was the first drug specifically designed with antipsychotic properties. It is an antagonist at a wide range of receptors which accounts for some of the side effects observed with this drug. It has particularly potent anticholinergic effects. Isoniazid (B) is an anti-tuberculous agent which has incidental antidepressant activity. Lithium carbonate (C) is an inorganic ion that has antimanic properties as well as being used in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. Trazodone (E) is an antidepressant in the ‘SARI’ (serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor) class. It also has prominent sedative and anxiolytic properties.",

Clozapine (A) is a powerful antipsychotic that is reserved for the treatment of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It is associated with a significant risk of developing neutropenia or even agranulocytosis, which means the patient must have regular full blood count checks. Lithium carbonate (B) is used in bipolar disorder and affective psychoses, not typically in schizophrenia. Pimozide (C) is an older antipsychotic that is used very infrequently in current practice. It has been associated with unexplained deaths and should only be prescribed after an electrocardiogram (ECG). Regular monitoring with ECG is also recommended during treatment. It is associated with prolongation of the QT interval and should not be used with other drugs (such as tricyclic antidepressants) that may also prolong the QT, or with drugs that may cause electrolyte disturbances such as diuretics.

    "explanation": "Delirium is treated in various ways, and certainly not just pharmacologically. While in certain circumstances benzodiazepines may be used, generally an antipsychotic is the treatment of choice, such as haloperidol (B). Amitriptyline (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant. Given its anticholinergic properties it may actually worsen confusion and would therefore not be an appropriate choice. Lithium carbonate (C) is used for the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and treatment of manic and depressive episodes. It does not have a role in the treatment of delirium. Temazepam (D) is a benzodiazepine and also a controlled drug. As stated above, while on some occasions benzodiazepines may be an appropriate choice for treatment of delirium, temazepam would not be the most appropriate one to choose from this class. A rare but important consequence of the use of benzodiazepines is paradoxical agitation. Zuclopenthixol acetate (E), trade name Acuphase, is a potent intramuscular antipsychotic medication. It is used in the management of extremely agitated patients who are not responding to the standard pharmacological treatments for rapid tranquilization.

It is extremely difficult to treat once present. Aripiprazole (A) is a newer antipsychotic which appears to have a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia than older agents (although of note it has not been licensed for a sufficient length of time to definitively state this). Clozapine (B) is a potent antipsychotic used in the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Unlike other agents, it is actually thought to improve the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.

Myaesthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neurological disorder caused by circulating antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. Any drugs that inhibit acetylcholine (such as anticholinergics) will worsen the symptoms of MG. Chlorpromazine (A) is a first-generation antipsychotic. It should be used with caution in patients with MG as it does have anticholinergic properties. However, it is not contraindicated as such. Citalopram (B) is an SSRI. It has potent effects at the 5-HT1A receptor but minimal activity at muscarinic receptors (although note not zero activity). Galantamine (C) is an AChEI used in the management of Alzheimer’s disease. It increases the availability of acetylcholine so in theory should improve the symptoms of MG, although it does not have a license for this in the UK.

Motor clumsiness is also common. Unlike autism (C), however, there is usually no language delay or marked cognitive difficulties, which are the other hallmarks of that disorder. The disorder usually persists into adolescence and adulthood and there is also an association with psychotic episodes. While the lack of warmth may lead one to think of an attachment disorder (B), the other symptoms would not be typical for such a diagnosis. Attachment disorders are considered elsewhere in this book. This history would not suggest a conduct disorder (D), in which there would typically be marked repetitive and resistant defiant or dissocial behaviours.

    "topic": "Diagnosis of psychiatric problems in childhood (2)",
    "explanation": "This history strongly suggests a conduct disorder (C). These disorders have caused significant debate as to their aetiology, with many considering them to be a social rather than psychiatric problem. Regardless, they cause significant problems to society as well as the individual, and unless managed well, will almost inevitably lead to other problems in later life. There is a strong association with adult dissocial personality disorder (psychopathy). There are thought to be genetic, family and wider environmental factors involved in the aetiology of these disorders. This history is not typical of ADHD (A), in which the predominant symptoms are those of inattention or poor concentration, hyperactivity and fidgeting and impulsivity. While children with ADHD can be difficult to manage, there is not such a degree of violent and destructive behaviour as exhibited here. However, ADHD and conduct disorder are often co-morbid with each other. Childhood disintegrative disorder (B) is a type of pervasive developmental disorder sharing some characteristics with childhood autism. However, unlike autism, children usually have an initial period of entirely normal development, before a period of definite loss of previously acquired skills and social withdrawal. Perhaps the most difficult distractor here is ODD (D). While ODD may progress to a more frank conduct disorder, it usually manifests in younger children and is characterized by disobedient and disruptive behaviour, but without the frank aggression and violence seen above. Tic disorders (E), such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, usually have their onset in childhood. Tics are involuntary, rapid, recurrent non-rhythmic motor movements or vocal acts that serve no apparent purpose. They can sometimes be suppressed but usually only at great difficulty and with significant accompanying anxiety. Their aetiology is complex but is likely to be related to basal ganglia abnormalities.",

    "explanation": "Risperidone (E) is an antipsychotic. These drugs should be used with extreme caution in children, and should really only be prescribed to target psychotic symptoms. They have the potential to cause significant harm if not monitored carefully, and they seem to lead to more severe side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, than in adults. While there is some evidence of antipsychotics being effective in reducing aggression in conduct disorder, they would certainly not be a first line choice of treatment. CBT (A) has been used effectively in conduct disorder. There are a number of different approaches used that could be classed under the umbrella of CBT, such as problem-solving skills training. The goal of such therapies is for the child to develop alternative skills to approach situations that previously had resulted in aggressive or violent behaviour. Family therapy (B) is used in conduct disorder and will be particularly useful in cases where there are disordered family dynamics or difficulties in bonding and attachment within the family unit. Supporters of family therapy believe it is helpful in avoiding excessive blame being placed on the child for their behaviour. Methylphenidate (C) is a stimulant medication that has been successfully used as part of the management of conduct disorder. It is particularly effective when there is a co-morbid element of ADHD in the presentation. Note that medications should be combined with other forms of social and psychological therapy in the treatment of conduct disorder. Parent management training (D) is another effective treatment which is supported by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. It involves parents and therapists working together to develop specific and systematic strategies to cope with and change aggressive behaviours.",

The latter is more commonly associated with psychological or emotional problems, while broadly speaking the former is often down to a developmental delay, a structural problem or other medical causes. Cluttering (A) is the symptom of rapid speech with a breakdown in fluency but no repetitions or hesitations (as compared to stammering). Encopresis (B) is the voluntary or involuntary voiding of faeces in inappropriate settings. It, like enuresis, may be the result of a wider emotional disorder, or may be secondary to the abnormal continuation of normal infantile incontinence. Pica (D) refers to the persistent eating of non-nutritive substances, e.g. sand, paint, or even faeces.

    "explanation": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (B) is a chronic tic disorder in which both vocal and motor tics are present (as in this case). The onset is usually at around 7–10 years and tends to worsen through adolescence. The cause is not fully understood, but there are undoubtedly both genetic and environmental factors involved. Neuropathologically, there are thought to be dysfunctions in thalamic, basal ganglia and frontal cortical structures. Asperger’s syndrome (A) is a developmental disorder predominantly associated with problems in social interaction, of which there is no mention in the above vignette. Hyperkinetic disorder (C) refers to a spectrum of disorders which includes ADHD. The core features of ADHD include excessive motor activity and restlessness. Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (D) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder that results in the inability to metabolize uric acid, leading to hyperuricaemia. There are numerous manifestations, including learning disability, striking self-injurious behaviour and odd movements that may resemble Huntington’s chorea but equally may look like Tourette’s. However, as there is no history given of developmental problems this would rule out this diagnosis here. This history does not represent a transient tic disorder (E) as it has been occurring for more than 1 year. Remember, for a diagnosis of Tourette’s, both vocal and motor tics must be present. In a tic disorder it will be either one or the other.",

    "page": 389,
    "topic": "Management of psychiatric problems in childhood",
    "explanation": "Psychoeducation (D) for both the patient and their carers is critical in managing tic disorders, including Tourette’s. The purpose is to explain the nature and course of the disorder to prevent deterioration in personal and family functioning. People with Tourette’s are at high risk of co-morbid disorders such as depression and obsessive–compulsive disorder – screening for these is also critical and targeted therapy should be recommended if they coexist. Atomoxetine (A) is a stimulant usually used in ADHD. It has been successfully used for Tourette’s syndrome but is probably only useful when there is co-morbid ADHD. Deep brain stimulation (B), is still a relatively experimental technique although it has been used for many years now. It involves the surgical implantation of a ‘brain pacemaker’ and has been used, with mixed success, in various movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, and possibly affective disorders such as treatment-resistant depression. However, it is still highly experimental and there is an obvious risk of complications, and it would certainly never be used in a relatively straightforward case of Tourette’s, and certainly not in a child. Psychoanalysis would not be indicated here (C) and there is no evidence that it is of use in tic disorders. Risperidone (E) is an atypical antipsychotic that has been used successfully in Tourette’s syndrome. However, while this may be an option, there is nothing to suggest here that the disorder is of sufficient severity to warrant the use of antipsychotic medication in such a young patient. It would almost certainly be best in this case to try supportive and educational techniques in the first instance before trialling medication.",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "page": 389,
    "topic": "Diagnosis of learning disability",
    "explanation": "People with learning disability, of whatever severity, are more likely to have co-morbid epilepsy (A), with some specific syndromes being noticeable, such as Lennox–Gestaut syndrome and autistic spectrum disorders. Mild learning disability is usually classified as occurring in people with an IQ of between 50 and 70 (B). Moderate learning disability is classified in the IQ range of 35 to 49, with severe learning disability at 34 and below. Obviously this classification is extremely arbitrary and the assessment and management of individuals requires much more sophisticated tools. Schizophrenia (C), like epilepsy, is over-represented in learning disability. Suicide is actually less common in people with moderate and severe learning disabilities (D), although the rates for those with mild learning disability have not been adequately established. Lack of means may play a part in this, as may poor understanding of lethality. Note that self-injurious behaviours are common in learning disability, and increase with the severity of the disability. While capacity must be carefully assessed when consenting someone with learning disability for medical treatment, by no means does this mean that a learning disability automatically assumes incapacity (E). Remember capacity is decision specific and must be assessed each time a decision is required.",

    "explanation": "Guillain–Barré syndrome is an ascending peripheral polyneuropathy caused by an immune response to certain foreign antigens, the most common being Campylobacter jejuni. There is no association with learning disability (D). Angelman’s syndrome (A) results from inactivation of the maternally inherited chromosome 15 (also known as genomic imprinting). It results in severe learning disability, almost no use of language, ataxia and unusual behaviour such as frequent laughter and highly excitable behaviour. Down’s syndrome, or trisomy 21 (B), is an extremely common form of learning disability. Edwards’ syndrome results from trisomy 18 (C). Only 5–10 per cent of infants will live beyond their first year. In those that do, severe learning disability will be ubiquitous. Hunter’s syndrome (E) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase. Despite a wide phenotypic presentation, it is always progressive and severe. Learning disability is often, although not always, present.",

    "answer": "A",
    "page": 390,
    "topic": "Down’s syndrome",
    "explanation": "Alzheimer’s disease is over-represented in patients with Down’s syndrome (A), and for those that survive to their sixth decade, at least 50 per cent of people will show clinical evidence of dementia. The reason for this is almost certainly that the amyloid precursor protein is encoded on chromosome 21, but other genes may also be important, such as superoxidase dismutase. Mosaicism, as opposed to nondisjunction in gametes causing trisomy 21, occurs for only 1–2 per cent of cases of Down’s syndrome (B). While there is some variation in the clinical presentation of Down’s syndrome, such as only around half presenting with congenital cardiac difficulties, all people with trisomy 21 will have some degree of learning disability (C). While many people with Down’s syndrome will require significant support, often including residential placement depending on the degree of disability, many people with trisomy 21 will be able to live independently, although will nearly always require some support to do this (D). People with Down’s syndrome are at a higher risk of most psychiatric disorders, including anxiety problems (E).",
