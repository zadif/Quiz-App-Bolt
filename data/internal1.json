    "question": "A 62-year-old Caucasian female is being evaluated after she had an episode of syncope. She complains of having progressive exertional dyspnea aver the last twa manths with an occasional dry cough. Cardiac auscultation findings over the apex are given below. Which of the following best explains the physical findings in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascending aortic aneurysm",
      "B. Constrictive pericarditis",
      "C. Mitral regurgitation",
      "D. Tricuspid valve stenosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The combination of this patient's exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and halosystalic murmur an auscultation are mast suggestive af mitral regurgitation (MR). Although the clinical manifestations of MR vary significantly with the degree of regurgitation, exertional dyspnea and fatigue are the most common symptoms, which occur secondary to a combination of decreased cardiac output and increased left atrial pressure. This patient's dry cough may relate to pulmonary congestion and edema, which is an indicator of more severe disease that has resulted in left ventricular dysfunction. The murmur of MR is classically a halosystolic murmur heard best aver the apex with radiation to the axilla.\nMitral regurgitation can occur as a result of primary mitral valve disease (e.g. rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis, or trauma) or may be associated with other cardiac conditions (e.g. ischemic heart disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).\n(Choice A) An ascending aortic aneurysm can be associated with aartic regurgitation, which wauld result in a diastalic murmur.\n(Choice B) Although patients with constrictive pericarditis often present with exertional dyspnea, physical findings such as elevated jugular venous pressure, pulsatile hepatomegaly, and signs of fluid overload are often present as well.\n(Choice D) Tricuspid stenosis would cause a diastalic murmur, nat systolic. Rheumatic heart disease is the most comman cause of tricuspid stenosis.\nEducational objective:\nMitral regurgitation classically results in a halosystolic murmur heard best at the apex with radiation to the axilla. Common clinical features of MR include exertional dyspnea, fatigue, atrial fibrillation, and signs of heart failure."

    "question": "A 74-year-old man presents to your office for a routine check-up. He has no present complaints. His medical histary is significant for right knee osteoarthritis. He takes naproxene occasionally, to relieve knee pain. He does not smoke or consume alcohol. His BP is 165/75 mm Hg and PR is 70/min. The physical examination showed a mild systolic ejection-type murmur at the base of the heart, to the right. An EKG revealed left ventricular hypertrophy and secondary ST segment and T wave changes. Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, without any flow abnormalities, was demonstrated on echocardiography. The ejection fraction was 60%. What is the most probable cause of hypertension in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Rigidity of the arterial wall",
      "B. Elevated plasma renin activity",
      "C. Aartic insufficiency",
      "D. Increased cardiac output"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is an important cause of hypertension in elderly patients. The pathophysiologic mechanism leading to ISH is believed to be decreased elasticity of the arterial wall, which leads to an increased systolic blood pressure, without concurrent increase (and even decrease) in diastalic blood pressure. Normally during systole, the heart ejects the blood under a certain pressure that is dumped by elastic properties of the aorta and major arteries. Then, this elastic recoil of the arterial wall contributes the diastalic flow of the blood and diastolic pressure. When elastic properties of the arterial wall diminish and arteries become more rigid, this 'dumping’ of pressure changes during the cardiac cycle also decreases. As a result of increased arterial rigidity, patients with ISH have a widened pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure). Widened pulse pressure was recently recognized as an important cardiovascular risk factor. Therefore, ISH should be treated appropriately, in spite of the fact that diastolic pressure is not elevated. Hydrochlorothiazide is considered to be the drug of chaice far this condition.\nAn increased plasma renin activity (Choice B) causes systolic and diastalic hypertension as seen in renal artery stenasis. Renin activity is low to normal during ISH.\nAartic insufficiency (Choice C) leads to elevated pulse pressure and can cause isolated systalic hypertension, but this was ruled out by echocardiography.\nAn increased cardiac output (Choice D) can be a cause of systolic hypertension in hyperdynamic states, such as in hyperthyroidism. There is no sign of hyperdynamic circulation in this case.\nIncreased intravascular volume (Choice E) causes systolic and diastalic hypertension in various renal disorders, with a decrease in the ability of the kidney to excrete solutes and/or water.\nEducational Objective:\nIsolated systolic hypertension is an important cause of hypertension in elderly patients. It is created by decreased elastic properties of the arterial wall. Always treat isolated systalic hypertensian, in spite of the fact that diastolic blood pressure is not elevated. The drug of chaice would be hydrochlorothiazide."

She denies any chest pain. She has no ather medical problems except a recent cold two weeks ago. She is not taking any medications. Her temperature is 36.7 C (38 F), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 20/min. Bilateral basal crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure, and 2+ bilateral pitting edema of the ankles are noted. Complete blood count is unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram of her heart will most likely show?",

      "A. Concentric hypertrophy of the heart",
      "B. Eccentric hypertrophy of the heart",
      "C. Mitral stenosis",
      "D. Hypokinesia of the inferior wall",
      "E. Vegetations on aortic valve",
      "F. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy",
      "G. Dilated ventricles with diffuse hypokinesia"
    ],
    "answer": "G",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation of this patient is suggestive of cangestive heart failure (CHF). A history of recent upper respiratory tract infection followed by sudden onset of cardiac failure in an otherwise healthy patient is suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy, mast likely secondary ta acute viral myocarditis.\nDilated cardiomyopathy is the end result of myocardial damage produced by a variety of toxic, metabalic, or infectious agents. Viral or idiopathic myocarditis is most commonly seen following Coxsackie B infectian. Viral myocarditis is seen in about 3.5-5 % of patients infected with Coxsackie B virus. Other viruses implicated are adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, echovirus, hepatitis C, influenza virus, parvovirus B-19, and Epstein-Barr virus. The diagnosis is made by echocardiogram, which typically shows dilated ventricles with diffuse hypokinesia resulting in low ejection fraction (systolic dysfunction). Viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy by direct viral damage, as well as sequel of humaral or cellular immune responses ta persistent viral infection.\n(Choice A) Concentric hypertrophy of the heart is seen following chronic pressure overload, as in valvular aortic stenosis or untreated hypertension; however, these are chronic conditions and would not have acute onset of heart failure.\n(Choice B) Eccentric hypertraphy of the heart is seen following chronic volume overload, as seen in valvular regurgitation; however, this is a chronic condition and would nat have acute onset of heart failure.\n(Choice C) Mitral stenosis is characterized by middiastolic murmur and opening snap. EKG shows left atrial hypertrophy. Chronic mitral stenosis would cause right ventricular hypertrophy and, thus, right ventricular heave secondary ta pulmonary hypertension.\n(Choice D) Hypokinesia of the inferior wall would be seen in case of inferior wall myocardial infarction, but clinical presentation of this patient is nat suggestive of myocardial infarction.\n(Choice E) Aortic valve vegetation can cause aortic regurgitation, which, if acute, would not have dilated heart, and, if chronic, would have eccentric hypertrophy of the heart. Also, patients with infective endocarditis appear sick, and they will have low to high-grade fevers, chills, or night sweats.\n(Choice F) Asymmetric septal hypertrophy is seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease of the young, and is less likely to present with acute cardiac failure, rather than sudden cardiac death which is commanly seen.\nEducational Objective:\nDilated cardiomyopathy may be seen following viral myocarditis (postpartum), particularly following Coxsackie B infection. Diagnosis is made by echocardiogram, which typically shows dilated ventricles and diffuse hypokinesia resulting in systolic dysfunction (low ejection fraction)."

    "question": "A 47-year-old woman loses consciousness for 2 minutes while shopping in a supermarket. In the emergency roam, she recounts feeling nausea and warmth spreading over her body immediately before passing out. She has never had a similar episode before. She has not seen a doctor for several years and does not take any medications, nor does she use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. Her family history is unremarkable. Which of the following most likely caused this episode?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cardiac arrythmia",
      "B. Seizure",
      "C. Neuracardiogenic syncope",
      "D. Heart valve disease",
      "E. Orthostatic hypotension"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Meuracardiogenic syncope, alsa known as vasovagal syncope, is a cammon cause of fainting. It occurs due to excessive vagal tone and is characterized by nausea, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and pallor immediately prior to the syncopal episode. It frequently occurs in response to stress, pain, and certain bodily actions (e.g. urination). tis particularly common in young women. Vasavagal syncope can be diagnosed with the tilt table test.\n(Choice A) Conduction disorders (e.g. AV block], tachyarrhythmias (e.g. ventricular ar supraventricular tachycardia), and disorders of automaticity (e.g. sick sinus syndrome) can all cause fainting. Generally there are na preceding signs ar symptoms, except for palpitations in same. Patients usually have underlying cardiac disease.\n(Choice B) Seizures and syncapal episodes are sometimes difficult to distinguish. This patient does not have clear signs of seizure (e.g. tongue biting), a history of seizures, ar a post-ictal state, making syncope mare likely.\n(Choice D) Syncope due to aortic stenosis most often accurs with activity. Dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue an exertion are symptoms of aortic stenosis that generally occur earlier in the disease course.\n(Choice E) Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure greater than 20 mm Hg after the patient rises to a standing position. It is most common in the elderly, diabetics, those with autonomic neuropathy (e.g. Parkinson's disease], those with hypovolemia, and peaple taking diuretics, vasodilators, or adrenergic-blocking agents. Prolonged recumbence increases the risk. Patients commanly experience pre-syncopal lightheadedness.\n(Choice F) Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) can produce syncope, but are a rare cause because the TIA must affect the posterior circulation and brain stem in order for syncope to occur. This patient has no risk factors for stroke.\nEducational Objective:\nMeurocardiogenic, or vasovagal, syncope occurs due to excessive vagal tone. Episodes are preceded by nausea, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and pallor. Fain, stress, and situations like medical needles and urination can all precipitate vasovagal syncope."

    "question": "A 25-year-old woman experiences sudden-onset palpitations and generalized weakness. During this episode, her blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and her heart rate is 160/min and regular. She has no significant past medical history and does not take any medications. She reports having a few similar episodes in the past, which she has self-treated by immersing her face in cold water. Generally, she says, cold water immersian relieves her symptoms within several minutes. This cold water therapy warks by affecting which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Vascular tone",
      "B. Sinoatrial node automatism",
      "C. Atrioventricular node conductivity",
      "D. Purkinje fiber conduction",
      "E. Ventricular myocardium contractility",
      "F. Venous return to the heart"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is the mast comman paroxysmal tachycardia in people without structural heart disease. Attacks begin abruptly and are characterized by heart rates between 160-220 beats per minute. The most common mechanism underlying PSVT is re-entry into the AY node. Mechanical and medical therapies far PSVT decrease AV node conductivity. Vagal maneuvers, such as Valsalva, caratid sinus massage, and immersion in cald water increase vagal tone and decrease conduction through the AV nade. This slows the heart rate and can often break the rhythm. Adenosine is a very short acting Av-nodal blocker that is often used as well.\n(Choice A) Cold water immersion increases the vascular tone in the face but this is not the mechanism by which PSVT resolves.\n(Choice B) Vagal maneuvers do decrease SA node automatism, but SA node automatism is not the underlying problem in PSYT. In most cases, re-entrant pathways through the AV node are respansible. Thus, AV nade suppression, not SA node suppression, will treat PST.\n(Choice D) Alterations in Purkinje fiber conduction would not significantly affect FSWT because the re-entrant pathways in PSVT da nat involve the Purkinje system.\n(Choice E) Ventricular myocardial contractility decreases with increased vagal tone. Changes in myocardial contractility will not affect PSVT.\nEducational objective:\nParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSYT) most commanly results from accessory conduction pathways through the AY node. “Vagal maneuvers and medications that decrease conduction through the AY node often resalve the PST."

His past medical histary is also significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and a stroke with residual left-sided weakness. He underwent caranary artery bypass surgery seven years ago and carotid endarterectomy five years ago. His current medication list includes lisinopril, hydrochlorathiazide, amlodipine, metoprolol, aspirin, metformin and glyburide. His blood pressure is 190/120 mmHg on the right arm and 170/110 mmHg an the left arm. His heart rate is 85/min. Physical examination reveals a periumbilical systolic-diastolic bruit. The latter finding is best explained by which of the following?",

      "A. Abdominal aortic aneurysm",
      "B. Aortic dissectian",
      "C. Aortic coarctation",
      "D. Renal artery stenosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has atherosclerotic vascular disease, hypertension, and an abdominal bruit concerning for renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenosis is a leading cause of secondary and refractory hypertension and chranic kidney disease.\nBruits are caused by turbulent blood flow within a vessel and often reflect luminal irregularities. Abdominal bruits are quite comman in young people, affecting up to 30% of patients without hypertension. They are found in up to 85% of patients with renal artery stenosis, compared to 25% of patients with hypertension. The character of the bruit is also suggestive of renal artery stenosis. Systolic-diastolic bruits are seen in approximately 40% of patients with renal artery stenosis but less than 1% of patients without renal artery stenasis.\n(Choice A) Abdominal aortic aneurysms are seen most commonly in older men with atherosclerosis and a smaking history. They classically present with a pulsatile abdominal mass. A systolic bruit may be heard, but a systolic-diastolic bruit would be rare.\n(Choice B) Aortic dissection presents with tearing pain of acute onset.\n(Choice C) Aortic coarctations are congenital strictures along the aorta. They can cause hypertension and differences in blood pressures between the upper and lower extremities. Patients are most often diagnosed in infancy or childhood.\n(Choice E) Aorto-enteric fistulas are rare causes of massive gastrointestinal hemarrhage. They may be primary or secondary (i.e. due to surgery). This patient does nat have any histary of surgery or Gl bleeding. Moreover, an aorto-enteric fistula would cause hypotension, nat hypertension.\nEducational objective:\nThe presence of a systolic-diastolic abdominal bruit in a patient with hypertension and atherosclerosis is strongly suggestive of renal artery stenosis."

    "question": "A 67-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He lost consciousness while shopping in the mall. He denies any nausea, diapharesis, chest pain, or shortness of breath. He has had two episodes of lightheadedness aver the last month, but has not seen a doctor. His past medical history is significant for long-standing hypertensian, which is being treated with enalapril. His blood pressure is 135/390 mmHg while supine, and 130/85 mmHg while standing. His heart rate is 64/min. ECG shows a sinus rhythm with high voltage, prolonged PR interval, prolonged QRS interval, normal QT interval and occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVC). Echocardiography reveals left ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection fraction (EF) of 55%. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's syncope?",
    "options": [
      "A. Bradyarrhythmia",
      "B. Decreased myocardial contractility",
      "C. Torsades de pointes",
      "D. Autonomic dysfunction",
      "E. Ventricular premature beats",
      "F. Seizures"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Syncope is characterized by the sudden, transient loss of consciousness with or without warning symptoms. Warning symptoms include lightheadedness, visual blurring, diaphoresis and nausea. Patients usually do not have any confusion ar neurological deficits following recovery from the syncaopal episode.\nMaormal patients can maintain the cerebral blood supply with a heart rate ranging from 30 to 180 bpm. When the heart rate is lower than 30 bmp, cerebral perfusion is impaired, even if there is a compensatory increase in stroke volume. A patient with a disease of the sinus node (sick sinus syndrome) ar conduction system can have intermittent bradycardia and typically manifest with recurrent syncopal episodes. The presence of a conduction disturbance on electrocardiography (e.g. prolonged PR or QRS interval) is often assaciated with bradyarrhythmias.\n(Choice B) Patients with cardiomyopathy and a low ejection fraction can present with exercise-induced syncopal episodes. An ejection fraction of 55% goes against the diagnosis of decreased myocardial contractility.\n(Choice C) A prolonged QT interval is associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia called \"torsades de pointes,\" in which the QRS complexes undulate over a point. The most important cause of tarsades de pointes is hypomagnesemia.\n(Choice D) Postural hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction can cause presyncope and syncape; however, this patient did not have any postural hypotension (i e., his blood pressure readings did not significantly decrease from a recumbent to an upright position).\n(Choice E) Ventricular beats, by themselves, are not associated with syncope.\n(Choice F) The most important differential diagnosis of syncope is generalized seizures. Distinguishing features of a seizure include the presence of sustained clonic-tonic mavement, tongue biting, and paost-ictal confusian.\nEducational objective:\nA prolonged QRS interval (i.e. typically bundle branch block) suggests a bradyarrhythmia, whereas a prolonged QT interval suggests a tachyarrhythmia."

    "question": "A 60-year-old male is 2 days status past, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. He had previously suffered fram an antero-lateral myocardial infarction. His cardiac enzymes have been trending down since admission. He has recovered well and is ready for discharge. He is currently asymptomatic. His temperature is 37.5 C (39.5 F), blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, pulse is 66/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is discharged with instructions ta take the following medications: aspirin, simvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and sublingual nitroglycerine. In addition to the medications listed above, which of the following medications should this patient also be taking after discharge?",
    "options": [
      "A. Isosorbide monanitrate",
      "B. Low molecular weight heparin",
      "C. Warfarin",
      "D. Clopidogrel",
      "E. Amlodipine"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "All patients wha have had a myocardial infarction should receive secandary prevention. The following medications have been shown to have a mortality benefit when given as secandary prevention:\n1. Aspirin (75-325 mg/day)\n2 Beta-blockers\n3. ACE-inhibitars\n4 Lipid-lowering statin drugs\nIn addition, clopidogrel should be prescribed to all patients with unstable angina/non-ST elevation MI (UANSTEMI), as well as patients who are past PCI {percutaneous coronary intervention). Clopidagrel belongs ta the class of drugs called Thienopyridines, which also include ticlopidine. These drugs have an anti-platelet effect and act by antagonizing ADP. Clopidogrel is preferred over ticlopidine because it has less toxicity associated with it.\nStudies have shown the following regarding the effectivity of clopidogrel:\n1. For patients who need to be on aspirin but cannot tolerate it, clopidogrel is an appropriate alternative because it is as effective.\n2. Far patients who are post UA/NSTEMI, clopidogrel + aspirin has been shown to be more effective, in terms of mortality, than aspirin alone. Data suggest that clopidogrel should be continued for at least 12 months following UA/NSTEMI. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely.\n3. Clopidogrel + aspirin is more effective than aspirin alone for the first 30 days following percutaneous coronary interventions (FCI), as it helps prevent subacute stent thrombosis. Patients who receive drug-eluting stents need a longer duration because epithelialization occurs slowly.\nIn patients with STEMI (ST elevation MI}, the role of clopidogrel depends on the form of reperfusion therapy (primary PCI, thrombolysis, or no reperfusion). Clopidogrel is recommended for at least one month in patients wha have undergone primary PCI with stenting (as stated above). Itis less clear whether clopidogrel should be used with thrombolytic therapy ar no reperfusion therapy, although some experts choose to do so.\n(Choice A) Isosorbide manonitrate is appropriate if the patient continues to experience angina; however, its benefits are symptomatic, and it has no effect on mortality.\n(Choice B) Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is usually given post-MI far the first 48 hours or until angiography is performed, but it is not necessary after the patient has been discharged from the hospital.\n(Choice C) Warfarin is indicated if the patient has evidence of ventricular thrombus, which is usually seen in individuals with apical infarcts and dyskinetic wall motion abnormalities.\n(Choice E) Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is typically not indicated in acute coronary syndrome, as calcium channel blockers have been associated with increased mortality in this patient population. These are typically used as anti-anginal therapy, along with long-acting nitrates in patients with diffuse coronary artery disease who are not candidates for either PCI or caranary artery bypass graft (typically referred as medical management).\nEducational Objective:\nClopidogrel should be included as secondary prevention following UA/NSTEMI for at least 12 manths. It should also be prescribed for thirty days (bare metal stents) to one year (drug eluting stents) following PCI, as it has been shown to help prevent subacute stent thrombosis."

    "explanation": "This patient presents with signs and symptoms of a multi-organ system disease process, including hypogonadism (testicular atrophy, decreased sexual drive), arthropathy, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction (diabetes) and hepatomegaly. Hemochromatosis is a candition that can cause the above findings, in addition to cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac invalvement may include dilated or restricitve cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure or various conduction abnormalities. Hemosiderin depasition in the pituitary can lead to hypagonadotropic hypogonadism and deposition in the joints can cause arthropathy.\n(Choice A) Atrial septal defects are usually isolated, sporadic congenital anomalies. Only rarely do they accur as part of an inherited disorder involving ather argan systems (e.g. Holt-Cram syndrome, which also causes upper limb deformities).\n(Choice B) Aortic stenosis generally results from localized senile calcific changes to the valve, which may be accelerated by the presence of a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve.\n(Choice C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results from mutations in genes that encode cardiac sarcomere proteins. It is not known to be associated with hepatomegaly, testicular atrophy, pancreatic endocrine insufficiency ar arthropathy.\n(Choice E) Endocardial fibroelastosis is a rare, idiopathic, diffuse fibroelastic thickening of the left ventricular endocardium.

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has primary hyperaldosteranism (Conn's syndrome). The presentation of a young non-obese and nan-black patient with hypertension should raise suspicion far secondary hypertension. Furthermare, this patient's symptoms, lab values and adrenal mass suggest Conn's syndrome. Conn's syndrome presents with hypertension, mild hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. This combination of abnormalities is the result of excess aldosterone, which promotes distal tubular reabsorption of sodium, volume expansion, and secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. The mass seen on the patient's CT scan is likely an adrenal adenoma secreting excess aldosterone. To definitely diagnose Conn's syndrome, renin and aldosterone levels should be checked. Aldosterone release is regulated by renin. Therefore, while aldosterone levels are elevated in Conn's syndrome, renin levels are decreased due to feedback inhibition. Symptoms of muscle weakness and exercise intolerance are the result of hypokalemia.\nEducational objective:\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism (aka Conn's Syndrome) causes hypertension, mild hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabalic alkalosis. The diagnosis of Conn's syndrome can be confirmed by findings of a low renin level and an elevated aldosterone level."

      "E. Digoxin",
      "F. Coumadin"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Following a myocardial infarction, ventricular remodeling occurs and gradually causes dilatation of the left ventricle with thinning of the ventricular walls. This can result in CHF. Ventricular remodeling occurs in the weeks to months following a myocardial infarction, therefore it was nat seen an the patient's discharge echocardiogram. ACE inhibitors have been shawn ta limit ventricular remodeling. An ACE inhibitor should be initiated within 24 hours of myocardial infarction in all patients without a contraindication.\n(Choice A) Aspirin is typically given to patients after myocardial infarction to inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent recurrence of coranary artery blockage. However, aspirin has na effect on ventricular remadeling.\n(Choice C) Calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine are not routinely prescribed for patients following myocardial infarction. They could be added if a patient has hypertension not completely controlled with ACE inhibitors and B-blockers.\n(Choice D) Isosorbide dinitrate is a long-acting nitrate used to prevent anginal chest pain. It may be needed by some patients with chronic symptoms of stable angina, but it does not prevent ventricular remodeling.\n(Choice E) Digoxin is shawn to provide symptomatic relief patients with systolic heart failure. However, it does not provide a mortality benefit, and it does not help to prevent the remodeling process.\n(Choice F) Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin are favored aver warfarin in past Ml patients, but neither will reduce ventricular remodeling.\nEducational objective:\nVentricular remodeling in the weeks to months following myocardial infarction can lead ta dilatation of the ventricle. This process is lessened by ACE inhibitors."

Her laboratory studies reveal the following:\nSerum albumin              4.5 g/dL\nTotal serum bilirubin         0.8 mg/dL\nSerum sadium               140 mEq/L\nSerum potassium            4.0 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine             0.8 mg/dL\nUrinalysis is within normal limits. What is the most likely cause of the edema in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Heart failure",
      "B. Liver disease",
      "C. Renal disease",
      "D. Venous insufficiency",
      "E. Side effect of her medications"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "It is important to remember that peripheral edema is a common side effect of the treatment with dihydropyridine Ca-channel antagonists like amlodipine. These medications can cause significant edema, as in this patient, due to the property to dilate peripheral blood vessels; it is NOT an allergic reaction! If the edema is significant, the drug should be discontinued. The clues to the correct diagnosis in this case are the therapy with a dihydropyridine Ca-channel antagonist, amlodipine initiated recently, and narmal physical examination with normal laboratory findings. Of course, it is necessary to exclude other mare serious causes of edema.\nCongestive heart failure (Choice A) is an important cause of lower extremity edema, but the absence of other symptoms of heart failure (e.g. dyspnea, orthopnea) and physical findings, especially elevated neck vein pulsation and liver enlargement, makes this diagnosis unlikely.\nLiver diseases (Choice B) can cause lower extremity edema, but usually ascites dominates over peripheral edema, and abnormal labaratary findings characteristic of liver dysfunction are present (e.q., hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia).\nRenal diseases (Choice C) can cause peripheral edema due to massive proteinuria (as with nephrotic syndrome) ar fluid retention (such as during acute nephritic syndrome). The absence of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and normal creatinine level are inconsistent with renal causes of the edema.\nVenous insufficiency (Choice D) is a possibility in this case. Symmetric edema without skin changes and varicasities, however, argues against venous insufficiency.\nEducational objective:\nDihydropyridine Ca-channel antagonists can cause peripheral edema and should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of this condition, along with other causes, such as heart failure, renal disease and venous insufficiency."

    "question": "A 64-year-old male who has not seen a doctor far the past 20 years presents to the emergency raam with excruciating chest pain that started suddenly about three hours ago. He describes the pain as tearing in quality and says that it radiates to his back. On physical examination, you hear an early diastolic decrescendo murmur at the sternal border. Chest x-ray shows widening of the superior mediastinum. EKG is normal. Which af the following medical conditions mast likely accounts far this patient's presentation?",
    "options": [

      "C. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome",
      "D. Bicuspid aortic valve",
      "E. Giant cell arteritis",
      "F. Diabetes mellitus",
      "G. Atherosclerosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The diagnosis here is acute aortic dissection. Patients classically present with sudden, tearing pain that radiates to the back. The decrescenda diastolic murmur heard here suggests aortic regurgitation, which can be a consequence of aortic dissection invalving the aartic root. The classic chest x-ray finding of a widened mediastinum is seen in about 60% of patients. There are a variety of risk factors for the development of aortic dissection, but the mast comman is hypertension (seen in abaut 75% of cases).\n(Choice B) Marfan's syndrome is caused by a mutation of the fibrillin gene, which results in \"weakened\" connective tissue. Patients with Marfan's syndrome are at increased risk for aortic dissection. However, Marfan's syndrome is nat the strongest risk factor, and would tend to cause aortic dissection in younger patients.\n(Choice C) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a connective tissue disease involving collagen that can predispose to aortic dissection. Like Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is not the most comman cause af aortic dissection and would tend to present in younger patients.\n(Choice D) There is an association between having a bicuspid aortic valve and developing aortic dissection, but it is not the most common risk factor.\n(Choice E) Giant cell arteritis is a large vessel vasculitis that often affects the aorta. While it can cause aortic aneurysms and dissections, it is a relatively uncommon cause.\n(Choice F) Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, but is not directly associated with aortic dissection.\n(Choice G) Atherosclerosis is a risk factor for aortic aneurysms, which can in turn lead to dissection. However, hypertension is a stronger and more common risk factor for dissection.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most common predisposing factor for aortic dissection is hypertension."

    "options": [
      "A. Digoxin",
      "B. Propranalal",
      "C. Lidocaine",
      "D. Quinidine",
      "E. Immediate cardioversion"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of Grave's disease - insomnia, fatigability, weight loss, lid lag, and tremor. Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of hyperthyroidism. As in other cardiovascular complications, atrial fibrillation in patients with hyperthyroidism is believed to be caused by increased sensitivity of beta-adrenaoreceptors to sympathetic stimuli. The best initial choice for these stable patients is a beta-blocker like propranolol. It nat only helps to control the rhythm in tachysystalic atrial fibrillation, but also diminishes other symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\nDigoxin (Choice A) is not a good chaice, because rapid ventricular respanse in hyperthyraidism-related atrial fibrillation is resistant to cardiac glycosides.\nCluinidine (Choice D), when used without pretreatment with rhythm-cantrolling drugs, may even worsen tachysystoly. It is not commonly used today for chemical cardiaversian.\nElectrical cardioversion (Choice E) is effective in restoring the sinus rhythm; but, if the underlying condition (hyperthyroidism) is not addressed, atrial fibrillation will mast probably recur. Emergent cardioversion is indicated if the arrhythmia precipitates dangerous complications (like hypotension, angina, or heart failure), or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable.\nLidocaine (Choice C) is useless in this situation, because it is not effective in atrial arrhvthmias.\nEducational Objective:\nIn patients with hyperthyraidism-related tachysystolic atrial fibrillation, a beta-blocker is the drug of choice."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Systemic hypertension is a major source of morbidity and martality worldwide. While the vast majarity of affected patients will ultimately require pharmacotherapy to meet their blood pressure goals, lifestyle modification can help. Weight loss is the most beneficial lifestyle intervention for obese individuals. Every 10 kg reduction in weight can decrease the systalic blood pressure by 5-20 mm Hg. For all patients, the goal BMI is 18.5-24.9 kg/m”.\n(Choice A) Regular aerobic exercise, at least 30 minutes per day an most days of the week, can decrease systolic blood pressure by 4-9 mm Hg.\n(Choice C) Smoking cessation will markedly decrease this patient's overall cardiovascular risk but will not significantly decrease his blood pressure.\n(Choice D) Improved glycemic cantral will decrease this patient's risk of developing microvascular disease (neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy). It will not imprave his blood pressure control, however.\n(Choice E) Limiting alcohol cansumption to na mare than 2 drinks per day for a man ar 1 drink per day far a woman will decrease the systalic blood pressure by 2-4 mm Hg.\n(Choice F) Restricting the daily sodium intake to no mare than 2.4 g daily will decrease the systolic blood pressure by 2-8 mm Hg.\nEducational objective:\nMost patients will require pharmacotherapy for blood pressure control, but lifestyle changes can make a difference. Weight contral is the most important intervention, followed by physical activity, salt restriction, and moderation of alcohol consumption."

    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to the emergency room complaining of chest pain for the past several hours. She describes it as sharp, centrally located, and non-radiating. The pain worsens somewhat with inspiration and movement. The patient denies having fevers, chills, dyspnea, swelling, or difficulty breathing at night. She says she first noticed the pain while exercising three weeks ago, but has experienced it at rest as well. She says that she has been exercising heavily in an attempt to lose weight. Her BMI is currently 34kg/m”. Her father had a myocardial infarction at age 60. Her medical history is significant far twa narmal vaginal deliveries. She smokes a half-pack af cigarettes daily. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 112/69 mm Hg and her heart rate is 72/min. Cardiac exam reveals a regular S1 and S2 without extra sounds or murmurs. There is tenderness to palpation over the sternum. What is the mast likely cause of her chest pain?",

      "E. Costochondritis",
      "F. Stable angina"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This woman's chest pain suggests costochandritis, a pain syndrome characterized by tenderness of the costochondral or costosternal junctions. The fact that her pain is sharp, focal, lasts for hours, and warsens with inspiration and movement all suggest a musculoskeletal etiology. That the tenderness is reproducible with palpation on physical examination also supports this diagnosis. The ather diagnoses listed dao not cause reproducible chest pain.\nEducational objective:\nChest pain that is reproducible with palpation suggests a musculoskeletal etiology."

    "question": "A 63-year-old man presents to the ER with substernal chest pain and diaphaoresis. The pain started one hour ago and did not remit with antacids. He has a past medical history of asthma for which he uses inhaled fluticasone and peptic ulcer disease for which he takes omeprazole. His family history is significant for prostate cancer in his father and breast cancer in his mother. Physical examination reveals a blood pressure af 180/100 mmHg and a heart rate of 30/min. A bruit is heard over the right carotid artery and a mild systolic murmur is present at the cardiac apex. Sublingual nitroglycerin and aspirin are administered in the ER. Within minutes, the patient reports decreased pain. Which of the following most likely accounts far this improvement in his symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increased left ventricular compliance",
      "B. Decreased left ventricular volume",
      "C. Decreased left ventricular contractility",
      "D. Increased systemic afterload",
      "E. Increased cardiac preload"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Mitrates like nitroglycerin decrease chest pain in angina pectoris primarily by reducing cardiac wark and increasing oxygen delivery to the myocardium. Their venodilatory effects account for the decrease in cardiac work. “enodilation causes blood to pool in the systemic venous circulation, which decreases preload. A reduced preload reduces ventricular volume and wall stress (stretch), thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Nitrates also cause some arterial vasodilation resulting in a modest decrease in afterload and myacardial oxygen consumption, but these are not the most impartant mechanisms of nitrate action.\n(Choices A & C) Nitrates do not directly alter myocardial compliance ar contractility. Such changes may accur as downstream effects of nitrate therapy, but this is not the way in which nitrates decrease chest pain.\n(Choices D & E) An increased preload or afterload would increase cardiac work, thus increasing cardiac oxygen demand and warsening angina.\n(Choice F) Significant arterial and venous dilation might result in rebound tachycardia in patients given high doses of nitrates. This would increase myocardial oxygen demand and warsen chest pain. Beta-blockers are used in acute myocardial infarction to prevent tachycardia.\nEducational objective:\nMitrates cause venodilation, which improves cardiac chest pain by reducing cardiac preload and thus decreasing myocardial oxygen demand."

Which of the following is the mast likely cause of her symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mitral valve prolapse",
      "B. Myocardial ischemia",
      "C. Rheumatic heart disease",
      "D. Mitral annular calcification"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has mitral valve prolapse that has progressed to mitral regurgitation and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Mitral valve prolapse is fairly common, affecting about 2-4% of the general population. There does not appear to be a strong predilection for gender ar age. The underlying pathology involves myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve. Mitral valve prolapse is the most common cause af mitral regurgitation, which typically causes a pansystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla. In some with mitral valve prolapse, a midsystalic click can also be appreciated. Mitral regurgitation can lead to increased left atrial size, which can in turn lead to atrial fibrillation, which is probably the cause of this patient's intermittent palpitations.\n(Choice B) Myocardial ischemia can cause mitral regurgitation, but is unlikely in this patient without chest pain or strong caronary artery disease risk factors.\n(Choice C) Rheumatic heart disease is uncommon in developed countries. It may lead to mitral regurgitation, but mitral stenasis is a more comman complication.\n(Choice D) Mitral annular calcification is not a common cause of mitral regurgitation.\n(Choice E) Infective endocarditis can cause mitral regurgitation, but there are usually accompanying signs of systemic infection such as fever.\nEducational objective:\nMitral regurgitation can cause a holosystalic murmur that radiates to the axilla. Mitral valve prolapse is the most comman cause of mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation can lead to left atrial dilation and atrial fibrillation."

      "E. Parathyroid gland disease",
      "F. Adrenal cartical disease",
      "G. Adrenal medullary disease"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This woman has hypertension, psychiatric symptoms (depression, mood swings, and poor sleep), recurrent kidney stones, and hypercalcemia. This presentation is concerning for hyperparathyroidism. The parathyroid gland produces parathyroid hormone (PTH) which acts to increase serum calcium levels and decrease serum phosphate. The mnemanic \"stones, banes, groans, and psychiatric overtones\" describes the comman symptoms which result from hypercalcemia. Specifically, hypercalcemia may lead to kidney stones, constipation/indigestion, and depression/fatigue/psychaosis. Patients with hyperparathyroidism also have an increased incidence of hypertension, although it is an uncommoaon cause of secondary hypertension.\n(Choice A) Renal parenchymal disease causes hypertension. However, parenchymal disease severe enough to cause hypertension should also cause a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. This patient's creatinine concentration is normal.\n(Choice B) Renal artery stenasis is an important cause of secondary hypertension. Usually due to atherosclerosis, renal artery stenosis generally presents with few systemic complaints and may be entirely asymptomatic. It would not explain this woman's hypercalcemia, kidney stones, and psychiatric symptoms. A bruit may often be heard upon auscultation of the affected renal artery.\n(Choice C) Aortic dissections present with tearing chest pain that radiates ta the back. They most commonly occur in patients with hypertension but are nat, themselves, causes of hypertension.\n(Choice D) Hypothyroidism causes weight gain, fatigue, bradycardia, depression, and skin and hair changes. This patient's hypercalcemia, kidney stones, and hypertension suggest hyperparathyroidism, not hypothyroidism.\n(Choice F) Corticosteroids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens are made in the adrenal cortex. This patient's systemic symptoms do not suggest Cushing's syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism, ar virilization.\n(Choice G) Increased activity within the medulla (pheochromocytoma) would cause hyperadrenergic symptoms such as weight loss, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and amdety.\nEducational objective:\nHyperparathyraidism is an uncommon cause of secondary hypertension. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia in a hypertensive patient ar the presence of \"stones, bones, groans and psychiatric overtones\" should raise suspicion for this condition."

Which of the following is mast likely to increase the murmur intensity in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Squatting",
      "B. Valsalva maneuver",
      "C. Sustained handgrip",
      "D. Recumbency",
      "E. Leg raising"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient mast likely has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The condition is mare common in African-Americans. It shows an autosomal dominant inheritance, so the sudden death of the patient's brother is likely a clue to the diagnosis. The patient's physical exam is also suggestive. A carotid pulse with dual upstroke accurs fram midsystalic abstructian that develops as the heart contracts. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically causes a systolic gjection-type murmur along the left sternal border, and often has a strong apical impulse. Contrary to most murmurs, the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy increases as preload decreases since this lessens the size of the ventricular cavity and causes increased outflow abstruction. Most murmurs will decrease with decreased preload since there will be less flow. The Valsalva maneuver is the anly maneuver listed that will decrease venous return, and therefore preload.\n(Answer A) Squatting decreases the vertical height of the blood column, and therefare will increase venous return to the heart. This increase venous return will result in a larger size of the ventricle and hence less autflow obstruction.\n(Answer C) Sustained handgrip leads ta an increase in systemic vascular resistance and increased afterload. Increased afterload leads to a larger ventricular volume and thus a decrease in outflow obstruction and a quieter murmur. Handgrip is typically used ta differentiate between the murmurs of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation where it causes a decrease and increase, respectively, in the severity of the murmur.\n(Choice D) Recumbency increases venous return. As described above, this will decrease outflow obstruction and the murmur will therefore be less severe.\n(Choice E) Leg raising will also increase venous return and will decrease the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nEducational objective:\nThe murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is located at the [eft lower sternal barder and is worsened by maneuvers that decrease preload (e.g. Valsalva, standing)"

He had several clonic jerks while unconscious. He never had such an episode before. His past medical history is significant for acute myacardial infarction six months ago and well-controlled hypertension. His current medications include captopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorathiazide, clopidogrel and aspirin. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg and heart rate is 80fmin with frequent ectopic beats. Physical examination revealed mild holosystolic apical murmur radiating to the axilla. Which of the following is the most probable pathophysiologic mechanism far his syncopal episode?",
    "options": [
      "A. Vasovagal reaction",
      "B. Arrhythmia",
      "C. Autonomic dysfunction",
      "D. Seizure"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The most probable explanation of the episode is arrhythmia. The clues for the correct diagnosis include sudden onset of syncope without warning signs, presence of structural heart disease (post-infarction scar and probable mitral regurgitation because of the characteristic murmur), and frequent ectopic beats. Anather important clue is the presence af the thiazide diuretic in the medication list that can cause electrolyte disturbances predisposing ta ventricular arrhythmia.\nVasovagal syncope (Choice A), a comman fainting spell, is usually precipitated by emotional reaction and is preceded by presyncopal dizziness, weakness and nausea.\nAutonomic dysfunction (Choice C) or drug-induced postural hypotension (Choice E) may cause syncope, but this syncope is orthostatic in nature. That means it occurs on standing when blood is redistributed ta the dependent parts of the bady. When syncope occurs without preceding change in body position (e.g. standing), it is unlikely to be orthostatic.\nClanic jerks may occur during any syncape if it is prolonged and are due to brain hypoxia. Absence of a previous history of seizure and the description of syncope make the diagnosis of seizure (Choice D) less likely in this patient.\nEducational objective:\nKnow the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms of syncape. Be able ta differentiate various types of syncope based an the clinical scenario."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is constrictive pericarditis, a condition marked by pericardial fibrosis and obliteration of the pericardial space. Constrictive pericarditis impairs ventricular filling during diastole, causing patients to experience symptoms of decreased cardiac output (fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, muscle wasting) and signs of venous overload (elevated JVF, ascites, positive Kussmaul's sign, pedal edema). Sharp 'x' and 'y' descents on central venous tracing are characteristic of constrictive pericarditis as is the presence of a pericardial knock (early heart sound after 52).\nIn developing countries, tuberculosis is a commaon cause of constrictive pericarditis (Choice B). In the United States, causes of constrictive pericarditis include idiopathic or viral (=40%), radiotherapy (~30%), cardiac surgery (~10%), and connective tissue disorders.\n(Choice A) COPD and pulmonary emboli are the most common causes of cor pulmanale. Cor pulmanale results from pulmonary hypertension. Signs of pulmonary hypertension on physical examination include a narraw split S2 and/or increased intensity of the pulmonic component of 52.\n(Choice C) Trypanosoma cruziis the cause of Chagas disease. tis endemic to South America and may cause megacolon, megaesophagus and cardiac disease. Whereas constrictive pericarditis anly impairs diastalic function, Chagas disease causes both systolic and diastolic heart failure. Chagas may alsa cause arrhythmias and mitralftricuspid regurgitation.\n(Choice C) Psittacosis is a disease transmitted to humans by birds. Patients present with fever, dry cough and headache. On physical exam, pulmonary findings are mast prominent. Cardiac involvement is rare.\n(Choice D) The pneumocanioses are occupational lung diseases caused by inhalation of inorganic dust. Examples include asbestosis and silicosis.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is suffering from hypovolemic ar hemarrhagic shack secondary to antepartum hemarrhage, probably placenta previa. Blood lass represents intravascular valume loss, which consequently decreases the cardiac output, as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (an indirect measure of left atrial pressure). The decreased cardiac output stimulates the sympathetic system, thereby leading to generalized vasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance), and an increase in heart rate. Although the goal af sympathetic stimulation is to increase the blood pressure back to normal, almost all cases of shock have blood pressures that fail to return to baseline.\nEducational objective:\nHypovalemic shock is characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, decreased central venous pressure (or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), decreased cardiac output, and increased peripheral vascular resistance."

    "explanation": "Canstrictive pericarditis is a condition where the pericardium is thickened or scarred resulting in restriction of diastalic filling. Because the heart is unable to fill properly during diastole, cardiac output is compromised and venous pressures become chronically elevated resulting in increased jugular venous pressures (JVF), severe ascites and hepatic congestion, dyspnea and weakness. On examination, Kussmaul's sign, failure of JVP to decrease on inspiration, is often present though not specific. The mast common causes of constrictive pericarditis are cardiac surgery, viral pericarditis and radiation therapy. Many cases are idiopathic. The diagnosis is established by identifying a calcified pericardium on chest x-ray, identifying a thickened pericardium on CT or MRI scanning ar by measuring pressures during cardiac catheterization. Treatment is with diuretics or pericardiectomy.\n(Choice A) Urinary protein loss causes generalized edema, including pulmanary edema in some cases, due to decreased oncatic pressure in capillary beds. However, his urinalysis shows no pratein.\n(Choices B and C) Fartal vein thrombosis or compression would cause ascites and peripheral edema but would nat cause increased VP ar hepatomegaly.\n(Choice E) Thoracic duct obstruction would cause lymphedema, a firm, nonpitting edema that does not cause the skin changes associated with venous stasis such as ulceration and dermatitis.\n(Choice F) Venous valve incompetence in the lower extremities causes dependent edema, but ascites and increased VF are not normally observed in the absence of concomitant disease.\nEducational objective:\nConstrictive pericarditis causes hepatomegaly, ascites and increased JWF due to decreased diastolic filling and impairment of cardiac output. Comman causes include radiation therapy, viral pericarditis and cardiac surgery."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion ane month after returning from a vacation in Texas. She says that her symptoms have progressed to the point that she now wakes during the night with a choking sensation that improves only with sitting up. Recently her shortness of breath has required her ta significantly limit her physical activity. She denies having associated chest pain, skin rash ar joint pain. She has no significant past medical history. Family history is significant for thyroid cancer in her aunt and lung cancer in her father, a heavy smoker. On physical examination, her temperature is 37 2°C (99° F), pulse is 86/min, blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, and respirations are 14/min. Bilateral pitting ankle edema is present. Her liver is enlarged 2 cm below the right costal margin. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the bilateral bases. Cardiac exam reveals the presence of a third heart sound. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette and small bilateral pleural effusions. EKG is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Atherosclerosis",

      "F. Hypathyroidism"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has signs and symptoms of CHF including paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and a third heart sound. Myocarditis is the most likely precipitant given her young age and lack of risk factors for caronary artery disease. Viral myocarditis, often due to Coxsackie B virus, is most likely respansible. Patients often, though not always, have preceding viral-type symptoms.\n(Choice A) Atherosclerosis-related ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of CHF butitis unlikely in this young patient with no risk factors.\n(Choice C) Lyme disease can cause myocarditis, but is more comman in the Northeast states than Texas. Accompanying rash ar joint pain may be seen in Lyme disease.\n(Choice D) While endemic to Texas, Coccidioides does not typically cause myocarditis.\n(Choice E) Autoimmune mechanisms can lead to a hypersensitivity myocarditis, often accompanied by rash.\n(Choice F) Hypothyroidism rarely leads to CHF.\nEducational objective:\nIn otherwise young healthy patients who develop CHF, myocarditis should be considered high an the differential. Viral infection, especially with Coxsackie B virus, is the most common cause."

    "question": "A 45-year-old mildly overweight male recovering from an anterior wall myocardial infarction develops sudden anset of sharp pain in the [eft side of his chest. He presented five days earlier with substernal chest pain and diaphoresis. He has had no dyspnea, extremity swelling ar palpitations since admission. His past medical history is significant far diabetes mellitus type 2. He seems mildly restless, especially in the supine position. The pain improves when sitting up and leaning forward. His breathing is fast and shallow due to the pain. His lungs are clear on auscultation. His blood pressure is 120/78 mmHg and his heart rate is G0/min.

      "I. Ventricular aneurysm"
    ],
    "answer": "H",
    "explanation": "Acute pericarditis is a complication of myocardial infarction that typically occurs within the first several days after the event. It is characterized by sharp, pleuritic pain that is warse in the supine position and improved by sitting up and leaning forward. A pericardial friction rub may be heard on examination. Diffuse ST elevations, especially with PR depressions, are typical ECG manifestations of acute pericarditis.\n(Choices A & F) Interventricular free wall rupture and papillary muscle rupture typically occur 3-7 days after myocardial infarction and present with new onset systalic murmur.\n(Choice B) Ventricular free wall rupture typically occurs 3-7 days after anterior wall MI. It presents with rapid deterioration secondary to pericardial tamponade. Pulseless electrical activity Is comman.\n(Choice C) Fulmonary infarction secondary to pulmanary embolism can cause chest pain, but it should not cause diffuse ST elevations on ECG. In addition, while the pain of FE is pleuritic, it should not imprave with leaning forward.\n(Choice D) Recurrent ischemia would most likely present with ST elevations focused in a few contiguous leads, rather than diffuse ST elevation. The positional nature of the pain is also more characteristic of acute pericarditis.\n(Choice E) Right ventricular infarction is most common with inferior wall MI. It presents with hypotension, but is unlikely to lead to such a rapid deterioration as is seen in this patient.\n(Choice G) Aortic dissection can cause acute onset of chest pain but it is not a typical complication of myacardial infarction and the pain is not pleuritic ar positional.\n(Choice I) Ventricular aneurysm is a complication of anterior wall MI that can occur days to months after the initial infarction. It presents with akinesis of the invalved partion of the left ventricular wall, ventricular arrhythmias, and systemic embolization.\nEducational objective:\nAcute pericarditis typically occurs in the first several days after myocardial infarction. It is characterized by sharp, pleuritic pain that is worse in the supine position and improved by sitting up and leaning forward. Diffuse ST elevations, especially with PR depressions, are typical ECG findings."

    "question": "An 88-year-old female nursing home resident is brought to the hospital with a one week history of moaning, decreased oral intake and decreased ambulation. Physical examination reveals a very thin female who is moaning and appears to be in pain. She opens her eyes spontaneously but does not respond to questions. Her blood pressure is 75/43 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, temperature is 35 5°C (96°F), and respirations are 22/min. Oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) is 97% on room air. Her skin and oral mucosa are dry and her neck veins are flat. There is no lymphadenopathy. On chest auscultation, there are crackles in the right upper lung lobe. Abdomen is saft and nan-distended. There is 2+ pitting presacral and lower extremity edema, and a deep pressure ulcer in the sacral area. Laboratory analysis reveals the following:\nSodium                155 mEg/L\nPotassium            5.3 mEglL\nGlucose               88 mao/dL\nBicarbonate           14 mEg/L\nBUN              151 mg/dL\nCreatinine          3.1 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the mast likely cause of her lower extremity edema?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increased plasma hydrostatic pressure",
      "B. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure",
      "C. Renal water and sodium retention",
      "D. Increased interstitial oncatic pressure",
      "E. Decreased lymphatic drainage"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "When a patient presents with multiple, non-specific symptoms and signs, it is helpful ta arganize the relevant clinical data. Here we have an elderly, nursing home resident, with issues including decreased oral intake, pain, and poor communication, as well as physical examination findings of hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, decubitus ulcer, right upper lobe crackles, flat neck veins, and 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. Matable laboratory findings include hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, elevated BUN and creatinine, BUMN/Cr ratio of 48.7 (ratio > 20 indicates prerenal azotemia), and low bicarbonate.\nGenerally speaking, lower extremity edema can result fram increased venous or lymphatic pressure, decreased plasma oncotic pressure, increased capillary leak, ar recent trauma aor infection. This patient has hypotension, flat neck veins and laboratory studies consistent with hypovolemia, so venous hypertension is unlikely. Lymphatic obstruction is a rare cause of edema, and the patient has no histary of lymphadenectomy, lymphadenopathy ar lymphangitis. There is no mention of hemasiderin pigment deposition on physical examination, so capillary leak is less likely, and there is no history of trauma or infection of the legs. Thus, the most likely cause of her lower extremity edema is decreased oncotic pressure resulting from malnutrition and a low serum albumin.\nEducational objective:\nBilateral lower extremity pitting edema may be a sign of hypoalbuminemia secondary to malnutrition. Decreased oncotic pressure causes the edema."

    "question": "A 84-year-old man complains of palpitations and progressive shartness of breath aver the past several hours. He says that he also develops a choking sensation every time he tries to lie down. His medical histary is significant for hypertension for the past 20 years and medication non-compliance. He also has a 35 year smaking history. He reports that his father died of a heart attack at age 70 and his mother suffered from asthma. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 170/100 mmHg and his heart rate is 130/min and irregularly irregular. Lung exam reveals bibasilar crackles.

    "options": [
      "A. Cardiogenic shock",
      "B. Diastolic dysfunction",
      "C. High-output heart failure",
      "D. Small airway bronchocanstriction",
      "E. Increased lung compliance"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This man has heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction, alsa called heart failure with preserved left wentricular ejection fraction. Diastolic dysfunction refers to impaired filling of the left or right ventricle, either because of impaired myocardial relaxation or a stiff, non-compliant ventricle. Contractility (i.e. ejection fraction) may remain normal but diastolic pressures are elevated, consequently reducing cardiac output. This leads to typical findings of congestive heart failure.\nSystemic hypertension is the classic cause of diastolic dysfunction. Chronically elevated left ventricular diastolic pressures cause left atrial dilatation, which in turn can lead ta atrial fibrillation, as in this patient. Treatment is with diuretics and blood pressure contral.\n(Choice A) Cardiogenic shock usually results from compromised left ventricular function due to an acute myacardial infarction or chronic heart failure. Affected patients show signs of heart failure but would not have the left ventricular function to produce a blood pressure of 170/100. An ejection fraction of 55% wauld be very unusual far a patient with cardiogenic shock.\n(Choice C) High-output heart failure refers to supranormal ventricular function that still cannat meet the body’ s metabolic demands. Causes include anemia, hyperthyroidism, beriberi, Faget's disease, and arteriovenous fistulas. The patient abave has a normal ejection fraction.\n(Choice D) Asthma is due to small airway bronchocanstriction and will not cause the signs and symptoms of heart failure described here.\n(Choice E) Lung compliance increases in chronic obstructive lung disease. COPD would not cause this patient's pulmonary edema or signs of right heart failure. Lung compliance is decreased in pulmonary edema.\nEducational objective:\nDiastolic dysfunction refers to impaired ventricular filling due to poor myocardial relaxation or diminished ventricular compliance. Itis usually due to hypertension and is treated with diuretics and antihypertensives. In severe cases, diastolic dysfunction can cause decompensated heart failure."

    "question": "A 22-year-old Caucasian male is evaluated for an episode of syncope that occurred while playing soccer. It lasted only 2 minutes without any post-syncopal confusion, sleepiness ar weakness. He had prior episodes af dizziness while playing active sparts as well as vague chest discomfort. His uncle died suddenly at a young age. Auscultation of his precardium reveals a [IV/VI] systolic murmur along the left sternal border. The patient is mast likely to benefit fram which of the following medications?",
    "options": [
      "A. Nitrates",
      "B. Beta-blockers",
      "C. Disopyramide",
      "D. Amlodipine",
      "E. Digoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 15-25% of patients report syncope as a symptom. Many athers will have presyncope and chest pain with exertion, as this patient has had previously. The disease has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and can often lead to sudden death, s0 the sudden death of his uncle is a strong clue as to the diagnosis. The finding of a systolic murmur at the left sternal border points towards hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as opposed to aortic stenosis which typically produces a murmur at the right upper sternal border. The murmur classically worsens with maneuvers that decrease preload since the smaller ventricular valume then leads to a higher degree of obstruction. The hypertrophied myocardium leads to primarily diastolic heart failure. Therefore, B-Blockers are one af the treatments af choice since they slow the heart and prolong diastole, leading to mare time for the heart ta fill and therefore less outflow obstruction. B-Blockers have an anti-anginal effect as well. A calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem is also a good option if patients are unable to tolerate B-Blockers.\n(Choice A) Nitrates would be a poar choice for this patient and should be avoided. They primarily act as venodilators, and therefare reduce preload. Decreased preload will lead to decreased ventricular volume and therefore mare outflow obstruction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n(Choice C) Disopyramide is an antiarrhythmic drug with negative inotrapic properties as well, and is an aptian for treating patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is very effective in reducing the pressure gradient across the obstructing hypertrophied myocardium. However, it is not considered first line therapy in part ta its potential to be pro-arrhythmagenic.\n(Choice D) Amlodipine is a peripherally acting calcium channel blocker, so it does not have the diastale-pralong effects of a drug such as diltiazem. It acts primarily as a arterial vasodilator.\n(Choice E) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes diastolic heart failure due to an inability of the myocardium to relax properly. Digoxin is therefore contraindicated because its positive inotropic effect may further warsen diastalic relaxation.\nEducational objective:\nThe first line of medical therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is either B-blockers or a cardiac acting calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem since they promate diastalic relaxation."

    "question": "A 55-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with muscle pain of recent onset. His past medical history is significant far hypertension and an acute myocardial infarction experienced 2 months ago. His current medications include metoprolol, captopril, aspirin and simvastatin. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and heart rate is 60/min. Liver function tests are slightly abnormal. Serum creatine kinase level is elevated. You suspect a drug-induced reaction. Which of the following is the mast possible mechanism of drug-induced reaction in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Immune-mediated reaction",

      "D. Synthetic reaction inhibition",
      "E. Damage of membrane-bound lipids"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Elevated liver enzymes and myopathy are well-known side effects of statins, the popular lipid-lowering drugs. They inhibit HWG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol that converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate. It is important to know that mevalonate is used nat anly for the synthesis of cholesteral, but alsa far the production of several other products including dolichol and CoQ10. Reduced CoQ10 production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of statin-induced myopathy; therefore the decrease in the synthesis of such products may be responsible for some adverse effects of statin therapy.\n(Choices B and C) Cell surface receptar blackage and extracellular enzyme blockage are the effects produced by beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors respectively; these are their main mechanisms of action, which may also cause some adverse effects.\n(Choice A) Immune-mediated reactions are responsible for a variety of drug-induced conditions, e.g. membranous glomerulonephritis induced by captopril.\n(Choice E) Damage of membrane-bound lipids is usually by peroxidation due to free radicals.\nEducational Objective:\nDecrease in the synthesis of non-cholesteral products may be respansible for some adverse effects of statin therapy; for example reduced CoQ10 production is implicated in the pathogenesis of statin-induced myopathy."

His medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease far which he takes antacids. On physical examination, he is afebrile. His pulse is 86/min, blood pressure is 140/56 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 14/min. While examining his heart you note a high-pitched, blowing, early diastolic, decrescendo murmur, which is heard best in the left third intercostal space and is intensified by handgrip. There is prominent cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Which of the following medications would improve both this patient's symptoms and cardiomegaly?",
    "options": [
      "A. Quinidine",
      "B. Metapralal",
      "C. Nifedipine",
      "D. Ephedrine",
      "E. Amiodarone"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient likely has aortic regurgitation (AR) based on his symptoms and physical exam findings. A diastolic decrescenda murmur at the left third intercostal space is classic for AR. Handgrip increases peripheral vascular resistance and afterload, which in turn increase regurgitation and cause a louder murmur. Patients with AR also have a widened pulse pressure (systolic — diastolic blood pressure), here 84 mmHg, due to an increased stroke volume. The regurgitant blood flow causes dilation af the left ventricle, seen as cardiomegaly an CXR.\nThe primary medical therapy for AR is afterload reduction with vasodilators like nifedipine or ACE inhibitors. For AR sa severe as ta cause symptoms, valve replacement is generally recommended.\n(Choice A) Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic medication.\n(Choice B) CHF secondary to AR should be treated according to standard CHF management guidelines, except that beta-blockers should not be used. By slowing the heart rate and therefore extending the time during diastole when regurgitation can take place, beta-blockers can actually worsen AR.\n(Choice D) Ephedrine has alpha- and beta-agonist activity and is sometimes used to treat orthostatic hypotension.\n(Choice E) Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication.\nEducational objective:\nThe murmur of aartic regurgitation is typically described as a diastolic decrescendo murmur at the [eft third intercostal space. Medical therapy consists of afterload reduction with calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient mast probably has aortic stenosis. Physical examination findings are characteristic far this condition {increased intensity of apical impulse, narrow pulse pressure, and typical systolic murmur). Exertional syncope is explained by aortic stenosis, which restricts activity-induced increment in cardiac autput. Age-dependant idiopathic sclerocalcific changes are the most frequent cause of isolated aortic stenosis in elderly patients. Usually these changes do not result in significant narrawing of the aartal orifice, but sometimes stenosis is severe.\nBicuspid aortic valve (Choice D) is a congenital anomaly that can lead to severe calcification and aortic stenosis, but usually manifests earlier in life.\nHypertension (Choice C) may contribute to aortal sclerocalcific changes, but does not cause aortic stenosis.\nRheumatic endocarditis (Choice A) rarely leads to isolated aortic stenosis, besides that, valvular abnormalities typically present earlier in life.\nBacterial endocarditis (Choice B) may lead to aortic insufficiency, but not stenosis.\nEducational Objective:\nAge-dependant idiopathic sclerocalcific changes are the most frequent cause of isolated aortic stenosis in elderly patients.

Rheumatic heart disease is the leading cause of mitral stenosis worldwide. The consequence of untreated Streptococcus pyogenes infection, rheumatic heart disease is most common in countries with limited access to antibiotics. Affected women often become symptomatic during pregnancy because of the physiologically increased total blood volume. Pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation may accur due to left atrial overload and enlargement. Physical exam may reveal a diastolic rumble at the apex and/or an opening snap.\n(Choice A) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of sudden death in yaung people, particularly African Americans.

Neurological examination reveals no focal findings, and there are no signs of head trauma. An EKG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. The first set of cardiac enzymes is negative. Which of the following is the mast appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. CT scan of the head",
      "B. Electroencephalogram (EEG)",
      "C. Exercise stress test",
      "D. Echocardiogram",
      "E. CT angiogram of the chest"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's signs and symptoms are consistent with aortic stenosis (AS), which is the most comman cause of left ventricular outflow obstruction in adults. AS is classically associated with calcification of the trileaflet valve (typically in those presenting at sixty years of age or older), a congenital unicuspid ar fused bicuspid valve (typically in thase presenting in the teens and early twenties) and less cammanly, rheumatic disease damage. As the aortic valve stiffens, the resulting high pressure gradient between the left ventricle (LV) and aorta strains the LV and causes hypertrophy. Patients with AS may remain asymptomatic for years. When signs and symptoms finally do develop, exertional angina, dyspnea, and syncope are often reparted. On physical examination, AS is characterized by a crescendo-decrescenda systolic ejection murmur in the right 2nd intercostal space that radiates to the carotids. Fulsus parvus et tardus, a weak S2, and an S4 may be noted. In the later stage of AS the LY may dilate, resulting in a displaced PMI and overt symptoms of heart failure. EKG findings are non-specific and suggestive of LV hypertrophy. An echocardiogram is used ta definitively diagnose AS, and may show aortic valve abnormalities, LV hypertrophy, and an increased LV-aortic gradient.\n(Choices A and B) A CT scan af the head would be an appropriate test if stroke or head trauma were strongly suspected. Similarly, an EEG would be appropriate if seizure were thought probable. The absence af post-ictal confusion makes seizure unlikely, however, and the lack of focal neurologic findings makes stroke or head trauma unlikely.\n(Choice C) Exercise stress testing is of some value in asymptomatic patients. In cases of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis, exercise stress testing is generally avoided because of the risk of inducing arrhythmias. If the patient were to have aartic stenasis requiring valve replacement, then the patient would undergo coranary angiography to allow far simultaneous CABG and aortic valve replacement. Patients with AS are advised to avoid strenuous exercise in general.\n(Choice E) CT angiogram of the chest would be an appropriate next step if there were strong clinical suspician for pulmonary embolism (PE). While severe PE may cause syncope, this patient's cardiac exam and several month history of exertional chest pain and dyspnea are mare suggestive of AS.\nEducational objective:\nEchocardiogram is necessary for the definitive diagnosis of AS. Symptomatic AS requires valve replacement."

    "explanation": "Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) are feared complications of myocardial infarction (MI), occurring in up to 10% of cases. WF may also occur in the setting of electralyte imbalances, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and as a drug side effect. VF is recognized on EKG by fibrillatory waves and absence of regular QRS complexes. The ACLS algorithm for VF and pulseless VT stresses the impartance af early defibrillation (Choice B). The energy required may be 200-360 joules. The greater the length of time that transpires between the onset of YF and use of the defibrillator, the lower the chance of survival. In the case of witnessed arrests of <5 minutes duration, defibrillation should be performed immediately. In unwitnessed arrests or witnessed arrests accurring >=5 minutes befare arrival of the defibrillator, a cycle of CPR should precede defibrillation.\n(Choices A, D, F & G) In the ACLS algarithm far VF and pulseless VT, defibrillation precedes the use af epinephrine and antiarrhythmics. Cnce defibrillation has been attempted, epinephrine should be given. Epinephrine administration is then repeated every 3 minutes while CPR is ongoing. After a repeated attempt at defibrillation, use of antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, lidocaine, and magnesium) is warranted.\n(Choice C) Digoxin is used for atrial tachycardias.\n(Choice E) Echocardiography is not appropriate for the management of YF or pulseless WT. Defibrillation is af primary impartance in these highly fatal conditions, as it has been proven ta improve survival. Attempting an echocardiogram now would interfere with defibrillation.\nEducational objective:\nIn VF and pulseless VT, defibrillation is of primary importance. Time to defibrillation is strongly correlated with survival."

    "question": "A 63-year-old Caucasian female presents ta the emergency room with a recent onset of left-sided weakness. She has been experiencing increased fatigahility, low-grade fevers and occasional palpitations aver the past two months. She has lost seven pounds during the same period. Her temperature is 37C (98.6 F), pulse is B0/min (regular), blood pressure is 120/76mmHg and respirations are 14/min. Her lungs are clear. Cardiac auscultation reveals normal first and second heart sounds and a mid-diastolic rumble at the apex. Echocardiography shows a mass in the left atrium. Which of the following is the mast likely diagnosis?",

      "A. Congenital heart defect",
      "B. Infective endocarditis",
      "C. Intracardiac tumor",
      "D. Myxomatous valve degeneration",
      "E. Rheumatic fever and atrial thrombus"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A mid-diastalic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex is often suggestive of mitral stenosis, but can be due to an intracardiac tumor obstructing the mitral valve as well. The presence of a mass in the left atrium points toward either a thrombus or an intracardiac tumor. The constitutional complaints of low-grade fevers and weight loss point more towards a tumar than a thrombus. The neurologic symptom of left-sided weakness in this patient is likely due to tumor embolization. Atrial myxomas are the most common primary intracardiac tumor, and approximately 80% arise in the left atrium.\n(Choice A) A congenital heart defect would rarely have its first manifestations in a patient of this age, and would be unlikely to present as an intracardiac mass accompanied by systemic symptoms.\n(Choice B) The patient's systemic and neurologic symptoms could be explained by infective endocarditis (IE). However, endocarditis typically causes a regurgitant murmur and fever. Vegetations can be seen on echocardiography in patients with IE. These vegetations are located on the valve itself and not primarily in the left atrium.\n(Choice D) Myxomatous valve degeneration is the pathologic cause of mitral valve prolapse, which causes a midsystolic click. It should not cause systemic symptoms ar a mass on echocardiography.\n(Choice E) The murmur heard in this patient could also be consistent with mitral stenosis, a common result af rheumatic fever. Mitral stenosis can also result in atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus. However, this patient's advanced age and weight loss make atrial myxoma a better explanation far her murmur and atrial mass than rheumatic fever.\nEducational objective:\nAtrial myxoma is the most common primary intracardiac tumor, and is usually located in the left atrium. It can cause systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss, neurologic symptoms due to tumor embalization, and presents as a mass an echocardiography."

      "C. Adenasine",
      "D. Digoxin",
      "E. Metoprolol"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has third degree, ar complete, heart block, meaning there is no conduction between the atria and ventricles (each are beating independently, hence no consistent pattern among PR intervals). The p waves accur in a cansistent pattern with a rate of 90-100 bpm while the ventricles are contracting with a cansistent rate of about 30 bpm. The duration of the QRS complex is longer than 120 msec, suggesting that there is a ventricular escape rhythm. This patient's histary of stable angina suggests that he has caranary artery disease. His new chest pain could very well be due to myocardial infarction, a potential cause af third degree heart block. The ventricular rate of around 30 bpm explains his dizziness and hypotension. The treatment of choice for third degree heart block is pacemaker insertion. Given the patient's potential to deteriorate further, this intervention should be performed in fairly short arder. Further workup to determine the underlying cause af his heart block is also warranted. If myocardial infarction is responsible, it should be treated as well (heparin, cardiac catheterization, etc).\n(Choice A) Cardiac catheterization may be necessary if this patient's heart block is attributed to myocardial infarction. However, complete heart block should be treated first.\n(Choice C) Adenosine increases conduction delay through the AY node, which would nat be helpful in this patient who already lacks AY node conduction.\n(Choice D) Digoxin also decreases conduction through the AY node and would nat be beneficial for a patient with complete heart black.\n(Choice E) Metoprolol is an AV nodal blacker as well and would not be beneficial.\nEducational objective:\nThird degree, or complete, heart black is marked by complete independence of the FP waves and QRS complexes both of which contract at completely separate rates. Treatment for third degree heart block is expeditious pacemaker placement, as the rhythm can degenerate into ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation."

    "options": [
      "A. Amyloidosis",
      "B. Sarcoidosis",
      "C. Hemochromatosis",
      "D. Scleroderma"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has congestive heart failure that is likely secondary to a restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is less comman than either dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It may be caused by infiltrative diseases (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis), storage diseases (hemochromatosis), endomyocardial fibrosis, or it may be idiopathic. Patients present with primarily diastolic function, which explains the patient's prominent physical exam findings of heart failure with anly mild systolic dysfunction an echocardiography. The left ventricular volume is normal in restrictive cardiomyopathy, and the wall thickness may be normal ar symmetrically thickened. Symmetric thickening of the ventricle helps to differentiate restrictive from hypertrophic cardiomyapathy, in which the interventricular septum is thickest. Signs of right sided heart failure often predominate in restrictive cardiomyopathy, as evidenced by this patient's prominent jugular venous distention, bilateral ankle edema, and tender hepatomegaly. Restrictive cardiomyapathy can cause signs and symptoms of left sided heart failure as well, such as the patient's bibasilar rales and pleural effusion. The ECG and chest x-ray findings in the vignette are nonspecific but are consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy.\nAll of the answer choices listed can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, hemachramatasis is the anly form listed in which the heart dysfunction can be reversed with treatment. The primary treatment for hemochromatosis is phlebotomy, which remaves iron fram the bloodstream.\n(Choice A) Once a patient with restrictive cardiomyopathy caused by amyloidosis develops cardiac symptoms, the likelihood of reversal is poor. Treatment is primarily supportive.\n(Choices B & D) Restrictive cardiomyopathy caused by sarcoidosis or scleroderma is treated with carticosteraids. While corticosteroids can slow the progression of these farms af restrictive cardiomyopathy and prolong survival, the damage cannot be reversed.\nEducational objective:\nCardiac dysfunction associated with hemochromatosis can be reversed with early identification of the disease and treatment."

    "question": "A 43-year-old white male is found to have premature atrial complexes (PACs) on routine EKG. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. He has smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. He also has a 20 year history of alcohalism, though recently he has limited his use to 1-2 beers/day. The patient's family histary is significant for a myocardial infarction in his mother at age 65 and a stroke in his father at age 72. He has no personal history of hypertension or diabetes. Physical examination, including vital signs, is entirely within normal limits. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?",

      "B. 24-hour Holter monitoring",
      "C. Echocardiogram",
      "D. Start beta-blocker therapy",
      "E. Advise him to stop alcohal and tobacco"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Atrial premature beats occur when there is premature activation of the atria originating from a site ather than the SA node. EKG will shaw an early P wave. PACs may occur singly arin a pattern of bigeminy. They may be a manifestation of underlying heart disease or may be idiopathic. PACs are usually asymptomatic, but can cause palpitations in some. Occasionally they may result in supraventricular, or less caommanly ventricular, arrhythmias. Treatment is required only when symptoms cause distress or when there is supraventricular tachycardia. Even in asymptomatic patients, precipitating factors like tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and stress should be identified and avoided.\n(Choice A) Reassurance alone is not appropriate as this patient has multiple modifiable risk factors for PACs. The patient can be reassured, however, that the condition itself is benign.\n(Choice B) Holter manitaring is used in the outpatient setting to identify intermittent arrhythmias in patients with symptoms like syncope or palpitations. This patient does not require halter monitoring because he has an asymptomatic arrhythmia that has already been captured on EKG.\n(Choice C) Echocardiography would be of limited value in this patient because there is low suspicion far valvular disease, coronary artery disease, ar heart failure.\n(Choice D) Beta-blockers are the standard treatment for symptomatic PACs.\nEducational objective:\nTobacco and alcohal are reversible risk factors for PACs. Beta-blockers are often helpful in patients wha are symptomatic."

These episodes usually occur after he exerts himself. He does not feel confused or tired after these episodes. He denies any chest pain or palpitations. His wife reports that when he collapses, he seems to lose consciousness for a few seconds, but then is back to being alert right away. She denies any jerking movements. His past medical histary is significant diverticulosis, for which he takes fiber supplements. He is nat an any other medication. His temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 110/98 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min. On examination, he has a fourth heart saund and harsh 3/6 systolic murmur, best heard aver the right sternal barder. The murmur is accentuated on expiration. The lung fields are clear to auscultation. After performing an echocardiograph to confirm the diagnosis, which of the following management options is mast appropriate?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aortic valvotomy",
      "B. Aartic valve replacement",
      "C. Close outpatient follow-up with serial echocardiograms",
      "D. Exercise test looking for arrhythmias",
      "E. Wait for symptoms to worsen"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). The key to this diagnosis is recognizing the harsh systolic murmur aver the right sternal edge, and knowing that only left sided heart murmurs increase on expiration. Furthermare, aortic stenosis causes left ventricular hypertrophy. The S4 results due to the forceful atrial contraction against the thick, non-compliant ventricle. Other suggestive signs are radiation of the murmur to the carotids, and a pulsus tardus et parvus (a slowly rising pulse that is sustained).\nThe classical indicators for surgery in patients with aortic stenosis are SAD: Syncope, Angina, and Dyspnea. Dyspnea results fram congestive heart failure. The onset of any one of these three symptoms indicates that the prognosis without surgery is poor (50% - 3 year mortality rate). This patient denies angina ar dyspnea, but reports syncopal episodes over the past two weeks; therefore, he is a candidate for aortic valve replacement.\nThe American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have published the following indications for aortic valve replacement:\n1. Symptomatic patients with AS\n2. Patients with severe AS undergoing CABG or other valvular surgery\n3. Asymptomatic patients with severe AS and either poor LY systolic function, LV hypertrophy >= 15 mm, valve area < 0.6 cm2 or abnormal response to exercise (eg. Hypotension)\n(Choice A) Aortic valvotomy is not nearly as effective as aortic valve replacement. It should only be considered as a bridge to surgery in the hemodynamically unstable patient or for poor surgical candidates.\n(Choice C) Medical management and close outpatient follow-up should be reserved for asymptomatic patients who do not meet any of the criteria for valve replacement.\n(Choice D) Exercise testing is generally avoided or performed extremely carefully in AS.\n(Choice E) The patient already has symptomatic AS, and is therefore a candidate for surgery. There is no need to wait until he develops more symptoms.\nEducational Objective:\nThe indications far aortic valve replacement are:\n1. all symptomatic patients with AS\n2. patients with severe AS undergoing CABG or other valvular surgery\n3. asymptomatic patients with severe AS and either poar LV systolic function, LV hypertrophy >= 15 mm, valve area =< 0.6 cm2 or abnormal response to exercise"

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Athletes with undetected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be at risk of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia. Performing a detailed medical history and physical examination is the most effective way to screen athletes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other forms of heart disease. The American Heart Association recommends that all school and collegiate athletes be offered pre-participation screening by a skilled healthcare worker. If this initial screening raises suspicion far cardiac disease, then further wark-up is indicated.\n(Choice A) No screening would be inappropriate. Often, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be detected by histary and physical exam. This can prevent sudden cardiac death.\n(Choice C) ECG changes in hypertrophic cardiomyapathy may include left ventricular hypertrophy, left axis deviation, and ST changes. However, these findings are non-diagnostic, and ECG is not used for screening.\n(Choice D) Once suspicion has been raised for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on history and physical, echocardiography is the standard method for confirming the diagnosis. However, it is not used as an initial screening tool.\n(Choice E) Like echocardiography, exercise stress testing is considered only when initial screening raises suspicion for heart disease.\nEducational objective:\nA detailed medical history and physical examination is the most effective way to screen a low risk population for the presence of underlying cardiac disease."

    "question": "A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency room with right-sided weakness that has persisted for the past several hours. He also complains of severe central chest pain that is \"ripping\" in quality and radiates to his back. He has had hypertension far the past seven years and has nat been taking any anti-hypertensive medication. He has been smoking ane pack of cigarettes per day for the past 25 years. His father died of caranary artery disease at age 44 years.

His neurological examination is significant far decreased power and tone in the right upper and right lower extremities. The rest of his physical examination is unremarkable.

    "options": [
      "A. Subarachnoid hemorrhage",
      "B. Hemarrhagic stroke",
      "C. Paradoxical pulmanary embalism",
      "D. Myocardial infarction with thromboembolism",
      "E. Aortic dissection"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The history and physical exam findings in this case are consistent with aortic dissection, an ominous candition in which a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta allows for the creation of a subintimal hematoma. Mast comman in men 40-60 years old, aortic dissection has been strongly associated with hypertension, cigarette smoking, and a family history of coronary artery disease. Three clinical findings are suggestive of aortic dissection, especially in a hypertensive individual: abrupt onset of \"tearing\" chest or back pain, a variation in pulse or blood pressure between the right and left arms, and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. When two ar mare of these clinical findings are present — as in this patient — the incidence of dissection exceeds 80%. ECG findings are non-specific. Dissection of the ascending aorta may extend into the pericardium, coranary arteries, ar carotid arteries, leading to cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, ar stroke, respectively. This patient's right-sided weakness suggests that the dissection of the ascending aorta extended into his left carotid artery.\n(Choices A and B) Subarachnoid hemarrhage may present with sudden onset severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting, and impaired consciousness. Hemarrhagic stroke presents with headache and focal neurologic deficits. As with aortic dissection, hypertension is a major risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke. However, this patient's presentation is not characteristic of either subarachnoid hemorrhage ar hemarrhagic stroke.\n(Choice C) A paradoxical pulmonary embolism (PE) develops in the venous system and travels to the arterial system through an abnormal communication between the right and left sides of the heart. Paradoxical PE can result in strake, which would explain this patient's neurologic symptoms. However, a PE would not cause a difference in blood pressure between both arms and would not cause \"ripping\" chest or back pain.\n(Choice D) Myocardial infarction (MI) features ECG changes such as ST elevations, T wave inversions, Q waves and new left bundle branch block. This patient's ECG contains no such abnormalities, however. The pain of an Ml may radiate to the left arm, neck or jaw, whereas radiation to the back is typical of aortic dissection.\nEducational objective:\nThree clinical findings are characteristic of aortic dissection; abrupt onset \"tearing\" pain in the chest or back, variation in pulse or blood pressure between the right and left arms, and widened mediastinum an chest x-ray. When twa or mare of these findings are present, the incidence of dissection exceeds 80%."

His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg in the right arm and 70/40 mmHg in the left arm. There is an 18 mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure between inspiration and expiration. His jugular veins are distended while sitting. Bedside echocardiogram demanstrates a moderate amount of pericardial fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely experiencing an acute aortic dissection. Classically, this highly fatal condition presents with tearing chest pain radiating to the back. An aortic dissection can extend into the carotid arteries, renal arteries, aortic valve, and/or pericardium, leading to stroke, acute renal failure, aortic regurgitation, and cardiac tamponade, respectively. This patient has substantial evidence of cardiac tampanade. He has hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, pulsus paradoxus, and demonstration af a pericardial effusion on echocardiogram. A difference in blood pressure between the right and left arm is comman in aortic dissection and reflects extension of the dissection into the great vessels feeding the left arm.\n(Choice A) Acute myocardial infarctions (AMI's) are important causes of chest pain and hypotension. However, AMI's typically present with substernal chest pressure radiating to the neck or arm. An AMI should not cause a difference in blood pressure between the arms.\n(Choice B) Acute pericarditis presents with sharp, pleuritic chest pain. Usually due to a viral infection, pericarditis may cause pericardial effusions and, rarely, cardiac tamponade. However, the nature af this patient's pain and the difference in blood pressure between the arms makes aortic dissection more likely.\n(Choice D) Pulmonary emboli (FE) classically present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. Patients with very large PE's may have hypotension due to acute right ventricular failure, however, FE's should not cause pericardial effusions or blood pressure differences between the arms.\n(Choice E) A tension pneumaotharax presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and hypotension. Physical exam reveals absent breath sounds in one hemithorax and a deviated trachea. A tension pneumatharax should not cause a pericardial effusion or a difference in blood pressure between the arms.\nEducation objective:\nAartic dissections are life-threatening emergencies that classically present with tearing chest pain radiating ta the back. Sequelae include cardiac tamponade, acute aortic regurgitation, stroke, and renal failure."

    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient has cardiac tamponade. In this disease, fluid in the pericardial sac limits the amount the heart can expand during diastole. The result is decreased preload and decreased cardiac output. Syncope may result fram decreased cranial blood flood. Tampanade presents as hypotension, right heart failure (distended jugular veins), and tachycardia. In this case, the patient developed pericarditis from an upper respiratory infection, causing a pericardial effusion. The ECG reveals electrical alternans—the amplitude of the QRS alternates as the heart moves in the fluid-filled pericardial sac. Pericardial effusions are well-visualized by echocardiography. The treatment for cardiac tamponade includes volume resuscitation and emergent pericardiocentesis.\n(Choice A) Procainamide is used to treat both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. It is not a first-line agent for either of these conditions, however, and will certainly not help with cardiac tamponade.\n(Choice B) Synchronized DC cardioversion is a treatment far atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.\n(Choice C) Thrambalytic therapy is indicated in an acute myocardial infarction when a cardiac catheterization suite is not available.\n(Choice D) Beta-blockers and aspirin are part of the therapy for an acute myocardial infarction.\n(Choice E) Transvenous pacemakers are temporary devices used to pace the heart before a permanent pacemaker can be placed. They are most often used for sick sinus syndrome and either second degree type II or third degree heart block.\nEducational Objective:\nCardiac tamponade is a grave condition characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, and distended jugular veins. The ECG reveals electrical alternans—the amplitude of the QRS alternates as the heart moves in the fluid-filled pericardial sac. Treatment consists of massive volume resuscitation and emergent pericardiocentesis."

PVCs can be seen in normal individuals, but are mare camman in patients with cardiac pathology. They often occur wath increased frequency following a myocardial infarction. Though numerous PVCs may indicate a worse prognasis, suppressing PVCs with antiarrhythmic medications has actually been shown ta warsen survival.

It has no role in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias.\n(Choice D) PVCs are an intermittent arrhythmia, meaning the patient is in sinus rhythm between FYCs. Thus, DC cardioversion has no rale here.\n(Choice E) Verapamil is not used to treat PVCs.\nEducational objective:\nPYCs are common in patients past-myocardial infarction and can be recognized by their widened QRS (=120 msec), bizarre morphology, and compensatory pause.

It is widely used to control complex forms of ventricular arrhythmia (e.g, ventricular tachycardia) in patients with acute caranary syndromes. At the same time, its use prophylactically to prevent the development of ventricular fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction is discouraged. Clinical trials demanstrated that prophylactic lidocaine decreases the frequency of YPBs (Choice C) and diminishes the risk of ventricular fibrillation (Choice A), but the overall prognosis is unaffected (Choice B). The problem is that lidocaine can increase the risk of asystole in these patients.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Coarctation of the aorta is a relatively comman congenital heart disease. In this condition, the aorta is narrowed, usually distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The severity of the coarctation determines the age of presentation. The most common clinical manifestation is hypertension in the upper extremities. Patients with mild coarctation may remain asymptomatic, however, some may complain of headache, epistaxis, blurred vision, or lower extremity claudication. The murmur of coarctation is systolic, heard best over the back in the interscapular area. Collateral circulation can develop via the intercostal arteries leading to rib notching, which is evident on chest-x ray, particularly in symptomatic individuals. Physical exam may reveal delayed femaral artery pulsations or hypertension in the upper extremity. In adults, enlarged pulsatile collateral vessels may be palpated in the intercostal spaces anteriorly, in the axilla ar in the interscapular area. Also, the upper extremity maybe preferentially well developed. Chest-x ray may show a dilated left subclavian artery and a dilated ascending aorta. Indentations af the aarta at the site of the coarctation and pre and post stenotic dilatation (the 3 sign) along the left paramedian border are almost pathognomanic. Notching of the ribs is an impartant radiological sign, is due to erosion of dilated collateral vessels, it increases with age and usually become apparent in the later years of life (Choice C).\n(Choice A) Tetralogy of Fallat is the most common cyanotic heart disease. The right ta left shunt produces cyanosis and the majority of children are symptomatic, with dyspnea, growth retardation, clubbing and polycythemia. VWhen resting after exertion, infants with tetralogy characteristically assume a squatting position. Chest-x ray typically reveals a normal sized 'boot shaped’ heart with prominence of the right ventricle. The pulmonary vascular markings are generally diminished and the aortic arch may be on the right side.\n(Choice B) Patent ductus arteriosus is an abnormal communication between the descending aorta and pulmonary artery. It is associated with birth at high altitudes and maternal rubella infection. Exam will reveal a hyperdynamic left ventricle and a machinery type of murmur at the left upper sternal border. Chest-x ray will show increased vascular markings. The main pulmonary artery will be enlarged. ECHO is diagnostic.\n(Choice D) Atrial septal defect is generally asymptomatic until the 3rd or 4th decade. Symptoms may include exertional dyspnea, fatigue and palpitations. Physical exam may reveal a characteristic fixed splitting’ of the second heart sound and parasternal RY lift. The chest-x ray will show increased pulmonary vascular markings, prominence of RY and pulmanary arteries. ECHO is usually diagnostic.\n(Choice E) Aortic aneurysms are generally asymptomatic in presentation and may accur in either the ascending or descending aorta. They may present with hoarseness, chest pain, dysphagia or a dry cough. Thoracic aneurysms are not palpable. The chest-x ray may show an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Bath ultrasound and CT scan are diagnostic. Control of hypertension is essential when aortic aneurysms are diagnosed. Surgery is indicated with aneurysm >= 6 cm in diameter, persistent pain, continued elevated BP or wide expansion of the aneurysm.\nEducational objective:\nCoarctation can present with rib natching on the chest-x ray. A \"3\" sign is typically seen with coarctation of longer duration, implying proximal aortic dilation, constriction and descending aorta dilatation."

    "question": "A 87-year-old Caucasian male is hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) with an episode of prolonged hypatension and shortness of breath. His skin is cold and clammy. Intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring is established, and pulmanary artery catheterization is performed to control basic hemodynamic parameters. His blood pressure is 70/40 mmHg, and heart rate is 100/min. Cardiac output (CO) measured by thermadilution method is 2.3 Limin. Pulmanary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is estimated to be 22 mmHg. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) calculated using data on mean arterial pressure, right atrial pressure and cardiac output is 2000 dynes*s/cm5 (N = 700 - 1200 dynes*s/cm5).

      "G. Neurogenic shock",
      "H. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Although history and physical examination typically provide a clue to the underlying conditions of shock and shock-like conditions, differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult. Findings obtained from invasive hemodynamic monitoring not only help to differentiate among various underlying conditions of shock; these findings can also be used in making important therapeutic decisions.\nKnowing the basic pathophysialogic mechanisms af shack makes interpretation of these findings easy. A depressed CO combined with an elevated PCWP (an indicatar of left atrial pressure, and most of the times left ventricular end diastolic pressure) is indicative of left ventricular failure. SVR is elevated as a result of neurchumaral activation {sympathetic hyperactivity, renin-angiotensin system activation) that is intended to preserve cardiac output and maintain tissue perfusion at an acceptable level.\nElevated PCWF is also observed in patients with volume overload (choice D), but CO is not decreased (it will be increased) in these patients, and SVR is nat usually increased.\nDepressed PCWP is characteristic for patients with absolute or relative hypovalemia that can result fram blood loss (choice B) or intravascular volume redistribution (choices C and G); decreased left ventricular end diastalic pressure (decreased preload) is the cause of hypotension and shock in these patients.\n(Choice H) Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) usually has normal or low PCWP.\nEducational Objective:\nDepressed CO combined with elevated PCWP ( an indicatar of left atrial pressure, and most of the times left ventricular end diastalic pressure) is indicative of left ventricular failure.\n*Extremely high yield question far USMLE!"

    "question": "A 32-year-old male complains of progressive weakness and exertional dyspnea. His past medical history is significant for a knife injury to the right thigh two months ago. He has been arrested several times far robbery. He consumes alcohol regularly, and smokes crack occasionally. His younger brather died of cystic fibrosis. His blood pressure is 160/60 mmHg, and heart rate is 100/min. His extremities are warm and flushed. Carotid upstroke is brisk. The point of maximal impulse is displaced to the left, and a soft, holosystalic murmur is heard over the cardiac apex. The murmur does not change with the Valsalva maneuver. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Decreased cardiac output",
      "B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "C. Increased cardiac preload",
      "D. Papillary muscle dysfunction",
      "E. Pulmonary hypertension"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Symptomatic arteriovenous fistula may be congenital, but usually it is after trauma. Shunting of a large amount of blood through the fistula increases cardiac preload and cardiac output. Clinical signs include widened pulse pressure, strong peripheral arterial pulsation (brisk carotid upstroke), and tachycardia. The extremities are typically flushed. The left ventricle hypertrophies, and the point of maximal impulse is displaced to the left. EKG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.\nIn patients with arteriovenous fistula and significant AY shunting, the oxygen requirements of the peripheral tissues are met by increasing the cardiac output. Normal hearts are usually capable of increasing the stroke volume and cardiac output without significant problems; however, cardiac functions can occasionally decompensate over a period of time, and result in cardiac failure. Such patients are considered to have heart failure despite their higher cardiac output because the circulation is unable to meet the oxygen supply of the peripheral tissues. Other causes of high output cardiac failure include thyrotoxicosis, Paget's disease, anemia and thiamine deficiency.\n(Choice A) Decreased cardiac output in patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension or cardiomyopathy is associated with narmal or decreased pulse pressure, weak carotid upstroke, and cold and pale extremities.\n(Choice B) The clinical findings of heart failure due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are mare or less similar to those of low output cardiac failure. The patients have both systolic (decreased cardiac output) and diastalic dysfunction (decreased ventricular filling). The ejection systolic murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy increases with the Valsalva maneuver.\n(Choice D) Papillary muscle dysfunction is ane of the causes of mitral regurgitation {and tricuspid regurgitation], which usually results from ischemic heart disease.\n(Choice E) Patients with pulmonary hypertension usually present with weakness, angina, syncope (ar presyncope) and dyspnea. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, reduced carotid upstroke, right wentricular lift, loud pulmonary second heart sound and tricuspid regurgitation.\nEducational Objective:\nAV fistula causes high output cardiac failure by shunting the blood from the arterial to venous side, thereby increasing cardiac preload. The patient develops heart failure despite maintaining a normal or high cardiac autput because the circulation is unable to meet the oxygen demand of the peripheral tissues."

      "D. Digoxin",
      "E. Dobutamine",
      "F. Home oxygen therapy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "While many of the medications used in heart failure primarily improve symptoms, ACE inhibitors have actually been shawn to prolong life. This benefit holds true for patients with CHF severity ranging from asymptomatic to severe. Patients are typically started on a low dose, which is then titrated upwards as patients talerate, as the improvement in mortality is dose-dependent. ACE inhibitars' benefit is a function of bath their hemodynamic effects (reducing preload and afterload) as well as their effects on the local renin-angiotensin system within the heart. B-blackers and spironolactone have also been shown to improve mortality in CHF.\n(Choice B) Though calcium channel blockers do not impact martality in CHF patients, amlodipine is sometimes used for hypertension control beyond what ACE inhibitors and B-blockers offer.\n(Choice C) While loop diuretics are an essential component of therapy for CHF ta prevent fluid overload, they have not been shown to affect martality.\n(Choice D) Digoxin can be used to improve symptoms of CHF In patients already on ACE inhibitars, B-blockers, and diuretics, but it has no mortality benefit.\n(Choice E) Dobutamine can be used temporarily in patients with severe decompensated CHF to improve cardiac contractility, but it increases the likelihood of arrhythmias and may actually increase mortality if used long-term.\n(Choice F) Patients with hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary edema benefit from oxygen, but there is no data that it improves long-term maortality.\nEducational objective:\nACE inhibitors have been shown in multiple studies to improve mortality in patients with CHF. Other commanly used medications with a martality benefit in CHF include B-blackers, angiotensin Il receptors blockers, and spironolactone."

    "question": "A 60-year-old man is brought ta the ER by his wife because he lost consciousness in the bathroom at night. He says that he woke up, went to the bathroom to urinate, and fainted there. He rapidly recovered his consciousness without any indication of disorientation. He has never had such an episode before. He admits ‘problems with urination,\" including difficulty with initiating urination and frequent awakening to void at night. He does not take any medication. His past medical history is insignificant. He smokes 2 packs of cigarettes per day and does nat consume alcohol His blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg while supine, and 132/80 while standing. His heart rate is T0/min. His physical examination is within normal limits. The ECG is normal. What is the most probable cause af the syncopal episode in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Arrhythmia",

      "C. Situational syncope",
      "D. Seizure",
      "E. Transient ischemic attack"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The most probable diagnosis in this patient is situational syncope related to micturition. The scenario described (middle age or alder male with prostatic hypertrophy, who last his consciousness after awakening and voiding at night) is typical far this type of syncope. The pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the situational syncope includes autonomic dysregulation, which can be partially explained by straining and rapid bladder emptying. Cardicinhibitory and/or vasodepressor mechanisms may be involved.\nCardiovascular causes like arrhythmia (Choice A) are less likely because there are no signs of a structural heart disease an the physical examination and the ECG.\nFaostural hypotension (Choice B) is unlikely because there are no signs of orthostatic BF changes, as well as no obvious cause for the problem, such as medications or hypovolemia.\nA patient with no previous history and a rapid recovery of consciousness argue against seizure (Choice D) as a cause of the episode.\nTransient ischemic attack (Choice E) is a rare cause of syncope, and is usually accompanied by symptoms af focal neurologic dysfunction (ataxia, paresis, diplopia).\nEducational objective:\nSituational syncope should be considered in the differential diagnasis of syncopal episodes. The typical scenario would include a middle age or older male, who loses his consciousness immediately after urination, ar a man who loses his consciousness during coughing fits."

    "question": "A 78-year-old man was operated on for a strangulated inguinal hernia and had approximately 40 cm of small bowel resected. On the morning of his third post-operative day, he falls while getting out of bed. Immediately after the fall, he is responsive but his speech is slurred and he cannat explain what happened. His pulse is 122/min, blood pressure is 96/50 mm Hg, and respirations are 23/min. Lungs are clear to auscultation and his heart has a regular rate and rhythm. His neck veins are distended. An ECG is remarkable far a new anset right bundle branch black (RBBB). Immediate resuscitation is started with wide apen intravenous fluids, but he becomes unresponsive. Shartly thereafter, his pupils start to dilate and his heart rate drops to 45/min. He eventually dies despite resuscitative efforts. What is the most likely cause of his death?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hypovolemia accompanied by syncope",
      "B. Acute ischemic stroke",
      "C. Myocardial infarction",
      "D. Post-operative sepsis",
      "E. Massive pulmonary embolism"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's history and presentation are strongly suggestive of massive pulmonary embalism (PE). Massive PE is defined as a PE complicated by hypotension and/or acute right heart strain. While dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are common symptoms of moderate and severe PE, syncope tends to accur only in massive PE. Jugular venous distension on physical exam and RBBE on ECG are indications of right heart strain. Because there is strong evidence of bath right heart strain and hypotension in this patient, the diagnosis of massive PE is highly likely. In conjunction with respiratory and hemodynamic suppart, fibrinolysis is indicated in the treatment of massive PE. Surgery within the past ten days is, however, a relative contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy. Mare than half of all patients who suffer a massive PE will die within the hour.\n(Choice A) Hypovalemia should be considered in the setting of syncope and hypotension. However, jugular venous collapse — not distension — would be expected in hypovalemia.\n(Choice B) Confusion and slurred speech always raise concern for an acute ischemic stroke. However, new onset jugular venous distension and RBEE are indicative of right heart strain, which is commanly seen in association with PE. Moreover, blood pressure is typically elevated with ischemic stroke. This patient was probably hypoxic, resulting in some central nervous system symptoms.\n(Choice C) The risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is increased during the post-operative period, and an MI could explain this patient's hypotension and jugular venous distension. The absence of ST elevation, T wave inversion, and Q waves on this patient's ECG make MI unlikely.\n(Choice D) Classic cardiovascular changes in the setting of sepsis include hypotension, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, and decreased pulmanary capillary wedge pressure. Fever and warm extremities may also be identified. Jugular vein distension and RBBE do not typically occur, however.\nEducational objective:\nMassive pulmonary embolism is likely in a postoperative patient with jugular venous distensian and new onset right bundle branch block."

    "question": "A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of branchial asthma presents to the physician's office for evaluation af high blood pressure. On her previous twa visits, her blood pressure has been 154/88 and 150/30. Her blood pressure during this visit is 150/90 mmHg. She denies headaches and has no complaints. She uses fluticasone and albuterol inhalers for her chronic persistent asthma. She denies smaking ar alcohol intake, and has no known drug allergies. Her family history is significant far myocardial infarction in bath her mother and father. Exercise and a low salt diet have not improved her hypertension. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's hypertension?",
    "options": [
      "A. Discontinue asthma medications",
      "B. Prescribe prapranalol",
      "C. Prescribe enalapril",
      "D. Prescribe hydrochlorothiazide",
      "E. Obtain an echacardiagram"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has had multiple BF readings of >=140/90. Her hypertension has not improved with lifestyle modifications (exercise and low salt diet). Therefore, the next step is to place the patient an an antihypertensive medication. The JNC guidelines suggest that the best first-line antihypertensive in a patient with no comorbidities is a thiazide diuretic, such as hydrochlorothiazide. The patient does have asthma, which makes B-blockers a poor choice, but is not a contraindication to hydrochlorathiazide.\n(Choice A) The patient is on albuteral for her asthma, which can raise blood pressure due to stimulation. However, asking the patient to stop her asthma medications is not a good choice since this would obviously worsen her asthma. It would be more advisable to continue her asthma treatment and add an antihypertensive agent.\n(Choice B) MNon-selective B-blockers such as propranolol should be avoided in asthmatics due to their branchaospastic effects.\n(Choice C) ACE inhibitors are the first-line antihypertensive agent far patients with diabetes, CHF, myacardial infarction, and chronic kidney disease. The patient does not have any of these comorbidities. However, if her hypertension is not controlled with hydrochlarathiazide, an ACE inhibitor would be a reasonable second agent.\n(Choice E) Long-standing hypertension may result in concentric hypertrophy, which can be diagnosed with echocardiography. However, this patient is newly diagnosed with hypertension and without complaints suggesting end-organ damage. Antihypertensive management and a basic wark-up consisting of a basic metabalic panel, urinalysis, and ECG is mare appropriate in newly diagnosed hypertension.\nEducational objective:\nChoose the appropriate initial antinypertensive therapy in a patient with asthma. HCTZ is the initial drug of chaice in the general population, and B-Blockers are relatively contraindicated with asthma."

    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Sinus arrhythmia",
      "B. Irregularly irregular atrial activation",
      "C. Variable AV node conduction",
      "D. Atrial ectopy",
      "E. Ventricular ectopy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This EKG shows atrial flutter, as evidenced by the saw-taoth pattern of atrial impulses, which are larger in magnitude than typical P waves and which do not all conduct QRS complexes. Atrial flutter is the result of a re-entrant rhythm within the atria. Classic symptoms of atrial flutter include palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness.\nThe saw-tooth pattern in this patient occurs at a rate of 300 per minute. The refractory period of the AY nade limits the ventricular response rate to <=180 beats/min. The mast comman EKG finding in atrial flutter is a 2:1 heart black, where every ather atrial impulse is conducted through the AY nade. Here the conduction of atrial impulses is variable, ranging from 2:1 to 6:1 (Choice C), suggesting an abnormality in AY nodal conduction.\n(Choice A) Sinus arrhythmia refers to the normal variation in heart rate that occurs with the respiratory cycle. EKG shows normal P waves, a QRS complex for every F wave, and a pattern that repeats with each respiration.\n(Choice B) An irregularly irregular rhythm with disorganized atrial activity and no discernible F waves is typical of atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice D) Atrial ectopy describes a phenomenan in which some atrial depolarizations ariginate outside of the sinus nade. The atrial ectopy can be identified by a F wave that is morphalagically distinct from those ariginating in the sinus node. This other P wave will also occur prematurely, and may or may not canduct to the ventricles.\n(Choice E) Ventricular ectopic beats have a wide QRS complex. There is one beat in the abave EKG that may represent ventricular ectopy. However, all of the ather QRS complexes are narrow, suggesting conduction through the AY node.\nEducational objective:\nAtrial flutter is recognized by a sawtooth pattern on EKG. In atrial flutter, the ventricular rate is determined by AY node conduction. A 2:1. 3:1, or 4:1 heart block is often seen."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Differential diagnosis of various hypotensive states requires the knowledge of basic pathophysiologic principles underlying shack. Twa very impartant clues are given in the scenario described above: depressed PCWP and normal MVo2.\nSeptic shock is a form of distributive shock that results from decreased systemic vascular resistance due to significant vasodilatation. Hyperdynamic circulation can be observed during septic shock, leading to an elevated cardiac output. Normal MVo2 can be observed in patients with septic shack, and results from hyperdynamic circulation and improper distribution of the cardiac output. It is not indicative of normal tissue perfusion in this case!\n(Choice A) The decreased FCWF (that reflects decreased left atrial pressure) indicates low left ventricular preload, and therefore helps to rule out cardiogenic shock.\n(Choices G and B) Other forms of distributive shack, such as neurogenic shack and hypovolemic shack, are typically accompanied by a low MVo2 due to increased oxygen extraction by hypaperfused tissues. Low left ventricular preload is also characteristic for volume depletion or intravascular fluid redistribution.\n(Choices D and E) There are no hemadynamic findings or manifestations in the patient's history to suggest volume averload ar right ventricular infarction.\nEducational Objective:\nThe hyperdynamic type of septic shock is characterized by (1) an elevated cardiac output, (2) low systemic vascular resistance, right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and (3) a frequently normal mixed venous oxygen concentration.\n*Please try to understand these concepts.

    "explanation": "Chronic oral contraceptive use is a common cause of secondary hypertension. 5% af chronic oral contraceptive users develop this complication, which is believed to be caused by an estrogen-mediated increase in the synthesis of angiotensinogen in the liver. It is impartant to recognize that oral contraceptives can be a potential cause of hypertensian in this patient, and simply discontinuing its use can carrect the prablem.\n(Choice A) If the hypertension persists after the discontinuation of the oral contraceptive, then essential hypertension would become the most probable diagnosis and lifestyle modification could be tried.\n(Choice C) The next step in the management could be low-dose thiazide diuretic, if the measures mentioned above failed to carrect her hypertension.\n(Choice D) Although renovascular hypertension is a possibility in this patient, routine intravenous pyelagraphy ar any other invasive diagnostic modality is not recommended.\n(Choice E) Just doing nathing is not a good choice because hypertension is an impartant cardiovascular risk factor, and should be treated properly to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.\nEducational objective:\nIt is important to recognize that oral contraceptives can be a potential cause of hypertension, and simply discontinuing its use can correct the problem."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is clearly presenting with congestive heart failure, but it is the extracardiac manifestations (proteinuria and easy bruisahkility) that paint towards amyloidosis as the etiology. In amyloidosis, extracellular deposition of excess proteins results in organ dysfunction. Common causes of amyloidosis include multiple myeloma (AL amyloidosis), and chronic inflammatary diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (AA amyloidosis). Deposition of amyloid fibrils in the kidney can result in proteinuria. Binding of amylaid fibrils to the liver can inhibit the synthesis of coagulation factors, resulting in increased bruisability. In the heart, amyloid deposition leads to restrictive cardiomyopathy with thickened ventricular walls and diastolic dysfunction. Systolic function is relatively well preserved, and ventricular dimensions remain unchanged.\n(Choice A) Consumption of two to three glasses of wine per night is excessive. However, alcohal typically causes a dilated cardiomyopathy This patient has preserved ventricular dimensions.\n(Choice B) Hemaochraomatasis is another cause of restrictive cardiomyapathy. Other classic findings in hemochromatosis include pancreatic dysfunction, bronzed skin and hepatomegaly.\n(Choice C) Sarcoidosis can cause a restrictive cardiomyopathy. tis mare common in African-Americans and usually presents in patients in their 20s-30s. Bilateral hilar adenopathy and erythema nodosum are classic findings in sarcoidosis. Renal involvement and proteinuria would be unusual.\n(Choice E) Constrictive pericarditis can be difficult to distinguish clinically fram restrictive cardiomyopathy. The increased wall thickness and extracardiac manifestations in this case paint away from constrictive pericarditis.\nEducational objective:\nAmyloidosis can result in a restrictive cardiomyopathy with thickened ventricular walls and preserved ventricular dimensions, as well as invalvement of the liver and kidneys."

    "explanation": "This patient has acute heart failure causing pulmonary edema, ar \"flash pulmanary edema\" secondary to an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI). A diuretic such as furosemide is the drug of chaice in this setting. Furosemide rapidly relieves pulmonary edema by decreasing the cardiac preload, thereby decreasing pulmanary capillary pressure. Furosemide also causes venadilation, which further decreases the preload. Other appropriate treatments in this situation include morphine (beneficial for bath anxiolytic and preload-reducing effects), nitrates, and oxygen. This patient also needs emergent PTCA or thrombolysis since he has ST elevations on EKG; in the meantime, anticoagulation with heparin is warranted.\n(Choice A) Even though IV beta-blockers such as metoprolal improve mortality in acute MI, they are contraindicated in the presence of pulmonary edema.\n(Choice B) Digoxin is used to improve symptoms in patients with chronic CHF; it is not used far acute CHF secondary ta an Ml.\n(Choice D) Spironolactone is sometimes used in the treatment of CHF and has been shown to have a mortality benefit. However, it is a weak diuretic, whereas this patient needs aggressive preload reduction.\n(Choice E) This patient has pulmanary edema requiring diuresis; IV fluids would likely make his condition warse.\n(Choice F) Verapamil is not typically used in the management of acute or chronic CHF.\n(Choice G) Amlodipine is a peripherally acting calcium channel blocker that is used for blood pressure contral, not CHF.\n(Choice H) Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic not used in CHF.\nEducational objective:\nDiuretics are a necessary adjunct to the treatment of MI if pulmonary edema is present. Beta-blockers are a standard therapy in MI, but should be avaided in this scenario as they can worsen acute heart failure."

    "question": "During a routine office visit, a 62-year-old male is found to have a pulsatile nan-tender mass above his umbilicus. His medical histary is significant for hypertension, chranic renal insufficiency, myacardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. He quit smoking 10 years ago. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 160/30 mm Hg and pulse is 76/min. Laboratory analyses reveal a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient's abdominal mass?",
    "options": [
      "A. Plain abdominal x-ray",
      "B. CT scan with contrast",
      "C. Abdominal ultrasound",
      "D. Abdominal MRI",
      "E. Mo testing required"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's pulsatile abdominal mass is most likely an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAAs are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. AAA rupture is a potentially life-threatening complication; therefore all incidentally discovered aneurysms require close follow-up. The imaging madality of choice for diagnosis and follow-up is abdominal ultrasound, as it has nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity, facilitates measurement of aneurysm size, and can show the presence of any associated thrombus. Ultrasound is relatively inexpensive compared to CT or MRI and has the benefit of not requiring contrast administration.\n(Choice A) Flain abdominal films may occasionally incidentally detect A&As in patients with calcified aortic walls, but the sensitivity is too low for use as a screening modality.\n(Choice B) Drawbacks to CT imaging as compared to ultrasound include higher cost, requirement far cantrast (which would be contraindicated in this patient with chranic renal insufficiency), and poor visualization of aortic branch arigin. CT imaging can add valuable information when the differential diagnosis af a patient's abdominal pain is broad, as it provides a better overall examination of the abdomen.\n(Choice D) MRI is a poar imaging choice for patients with renal insufficiency given the association of nephrogenic dermatopathy with gadolinium administration. It is also much mare expensive than ultrasound.\n(Choice E) AAA rupture should be suspected in a patient with a pulsatile abdominal mass, hypotension, and abdominal pain. In this scenaria it is appropriate to forego imaging and emergently send the patient to the OR.\nEducational objective:\nAbdominal ultrasound is the study of choice for diagnosis and follow-up of abdominal aortic aneurysms, as it has nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity for this condition."

    "question": "A 20-year-old white female presents with chest pain for the past few weeks. She describes the pain as sharp, located to the left of the sternum, and lasting 5-10 seconds at a time. There is no associated fever, cough, breathlessness, palpitations, or syncope. She does nat smake aor drink alcohol. On cardiac examination, there is a short systolic murmur at the apex that disappears with squatting. Which of the following is the mast likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mitral valve prolapse",
      "B. Ventricular septal defect",
      "C. Rheumatic heart disease",
      "D. Bicuspid aortic valve",
      "E. Infective endocarditis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's murmur is mast cansistent with mitral valve prolapse (MVF). MVP typically causes a mid-systolic click aver the cardiac apex, with an accompanying short systolic murmur if mitral regurgitation is present. Squatting increases the cardiac preload by augmenting venous return, which in return decreases ar in this case eliminates the prolapse. Patients with MVP have a higher-than-expected incidence of chest pain compared with the normal population, which cannot be explained by the valvular abnormality. The pain is atypical for cardiac pain and is easily distinguishable fram angina (e.g., pain lasting 5-10 seconds), although the patient should still undergo the standard chest pain work-up. Anxiety, palpitations, and hyperventilation are also reportedly more common in patients with mitral valve prolapse, although this is somewhat cantraversial. This association is sametimes referred to as the mitral valve prolapse syndrome.\n(Choice B) Ventricular septal defects typically cause a left-to-right shunt and holosystolic murmur. The intensity of the murmur increases with squatting.\n(Choice C) Rheumatic heart disease is uncommon in developed countries. It may lead to mitral regurgitation, but mitral stenasis is a more comman complication.\n(Choice D) A bicuspid aortic valve can cause early aortic stenasis, but aortic stenosis would cause a systolic ejection murmur that is loudest at the right upper sternal border and radiates to the carotids.\n(Choice E) Infective endocarditis can cause mitral regurgitation, but patients usually have signs of systemic illness including fever.\nEducational objective:\nMitral valve prolapse (MVP) typically causes a mid-systolic click over the cardiac apex, with a short systolic murmur at the apex after the click if mitral regurgitation is present. Squatting decreases the murmur. MVP is sometimes associated with chest pain, anxiety, palpitations, and/or hyperventilation."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of two weeks of weakness, low-grade fevers, and exertional shortness of breath. He also nates fingertip pain and urine that has been dark and cloudy recently. On physical examination, several of his proximal interphalangeal joints are swollen. Which of the following diagnoses is most consistent with his presentation?",
    "options": [
      "A. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "B. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis",
      "C. Adult Still's disease",
      "D. Infective endocarditis",
      "E. Adrenal insufficiency"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has infective endocarditis (IE), or subacute bacterial endocarditis. IE often causes non-specific symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise) making it difficult to diagnose. Duke's criteria are used to make the diagnosis. The major criteria are: two or more blood cultures pasitive far a typical organism (e.g. S. viridans, S. aureus), endocardial involvement on echocardiography, or presence of a new murmur. The minor criteria are: presence of a predisposing condition (e.g. prosthetic valve, IV drug use), fever of 38.0°C or greater, suggestive vascular phenomena (e.g. septic embali), immunologic phenomena (e.g. glomerulonephritis), or one positive blood culture. The presence of two major criteria, one major and three minor criteria, ar five minor criteria are considered diagnostic of IE.\nMany of the non-cardiac complications of IE are related to septic embali lodging in sites distal to the infected valve, such as mycotic aneurysms, abdominal abscesses, septic pulmonary emboli, renal abscesses, conjunctival hemarrhages, and Janeway lesions. Several other complications result from immune-complex deposition within tissues. This patient has several suggestions of immunalagic phenomena related to IE, such as Osler's nodes (painful fingertip nodules) and glamerulonephritis. His arthritis may also be due to immune-complex deposition.\n(Choice A) Rheumatoid arthritis can cause fevers and progressive fatigue. However, it is unlikely to account for this patient's fingertip pain ar dark, cloudy urine.\n(Choice B) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is typically preceded by a sore throat or a skin infection. It presents with edema, dark urine, and hypertension. Arthritis and fingertip pain are not characteristic.\n(Choice C) Adult Still's disease is an inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent high fevers (39°C or greater), rash, and arthritis. The rash is often a maculopapular, non-pruritic rash affecting the trunk and extremities during febrile episodes. Renal disease and painful skin nodules are not characteristic.\n(Choice E) Adrenal insufficiency causes nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, weakness, anorexia, Gl disturbances, and weight loss. Physical exam and lab studies typically reveal hypotension, hyperpigmentation, and hyponatremia. This patient's arthritis, renal disease, and painful hands are not consistent with adrenal insufficiency.\nEducational objective:\nInfective endocarditis often presents with progressive subacute fevers, chills, malaise, and dyspnea. Itis diagnosed using Duke's criteria. Complications include vascular (i.e. embolic) and immune complex phenomena."

    "question": "A 59-year-old man comes to visit his friend in the hospital and collapses in the parking lot. He had been feeling unwell all day due to vague chest discomfort. A bystander witnesses his collapse, finds no pulse, and immediately calls for help. Which of the following is the most important factor for survival in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Time ta chest compressions",
      "B. Time ta defibrillation",
      "C. Time to endotracheal intubation",
      "D. Time to epinephrine injection",
      "E. Time to cardiac catheterization lab"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The leading cause of witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests is a ventricular arrhythmia, either ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Technically, this patient is having an out-of-hospital arrest since he is not, himself, hospitalized. According ta the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ALCS) algorithm, immediate defibrillation within the first 4-5 minutes after witnessed cardiac arrest should be performed as it improves survival. For unwitnessed cardiac arrests, or cases in which the defibrillator is nat available within 5 minutes af cardiac arrest, a two minute trial of CPR prior to defibrillation improves survival. The time ta defibrillation is af critical importance in unstable ventricular rhythms.\n(Choice A) When a cardiac arrest is unwitnessed or when there is a greater than 4-5 minute lapse between arrest and arrival of the defibrillator, a trial of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should precede defibrillation. CPR should be started immediately after defibrillation in patients who have had witnessed arrests.\n(Choice C) The new ACLS algorithm downplays the impartance of endotracheal intubation. It should be performed after several rounds of CPR.\n(Choice D) Epinephrine injection is in the ACLS algorithm for tachycardic and pulseless electrical activity/systolic arrests. However, it is not the first or most impartant step for any form of cardiac arrest.\n(Choice E) The leading causes of ventricular arrhythmias are ischemia and structural heart disease. For this reason, patients with witnessed arrests often require cardiac catheterization: however, a normal rhythm must be restored for catheterization to be beneficial.\nEducational objective:\nOptimally, the first step in treating a patient with a witnessed cardiac arrest is defibrillation. When a cardiac arrest is unwitnessed or when there is a greater than 4-8 minute lapse between arrest and arrival of the defibrillator, a trial of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should precede defibrillation."

This marning, his knee felt better and he attempted to get up from bed. However, upon attempting ta stand, he sustained a brief loss of consciousness. He had no symptoms ar medical history prior to the knee injury. Medications include acetaminophen and ibuprofen far knee pain. On exam, his pulse is 73/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 136/83 mmHg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's syncope?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cardiac arrhythmia",
      "B. Valvular obstruction",
      "C. Orthostatic hypotension",
      "D. Vagal nerve hyperactivity",
      "E. Hyperventilation",
      "F. Transient ischemic attack"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely experienced syncope due to orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure greater than 20 mmHg when moving from lying down ta standing. It is cammaon in patients who are elderly, are hypavolemic, ar have autonomic neuropathy (e.g, diabetes ar Parkinson's disease). Additionally, medications such as diuretics, vasodilators, and adrenergic-blocking agents can cause orthostatic hypotension. Prolonged recumbence increases the risk. People will aften note a pre-syncopal lightheaded sensation. The scenario described in this vignette is classic for arthostatic hypotension—an older person who experiences syncope upon standing after a period of bed rest.\n(Choice A) Syncope due to a cardiac arrhythmia may occur due to conduction disorders (e.g, AV block), tachyarrhythmias (e.g. ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia), ar disorders of automaticity (e.g. sick sinus syndrome). Patients with cardiogenic syncope usually have a history of underlying cardiac disease, such as coronary artery disease ar cardiomyopathy.\n(Choice B) Syncope may result from valvular obstruction, particularly in patients with critical aortic stenosis (AS). Syncope due to AS most often occurs with activity. Patients that experience syncope secondary to AS usually have a preceding history of exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and/or fatigue.\n(Choice D) Excessive vagal tone is the mechanism behind vasovagal syncope. This disorder is characterized by nausea, diaphoresis, and pallor prior to syncope. It frequently occurs in response to stress, pain, and certain actions (e g., urination). It is particularly cammaon in young women.\n(Choice E) Hyperventilation is a rare cause of syncope. Overbreathing decreases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood and promotes vasoconstriction. In severe cases, syncope may occur. There is usually a preceding psychological stressar or sensation of anxiety.\n(Choice F) Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are another rare cause of syncope. The TIA must affect the posterior circulation and brainstem in arder for syncope to occur.\nEducational Objective:\nCrthostatic hypotension is characterized by a drop in blood pressure after standing and is typically preceded by a lightheaded ar presyncopal sensation."

    "question": "A 47-year-old female, who is a chronic alcoholic, is admitted to the hospital with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her serum amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated and the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is made. She is maintained nothing by mouth (NFO), and receives intravenous hydration and narcotic analgesics. On the second day of hospitalization she develops progressive shortness of breath. Her temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F), blood pressure is 110/66 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 24/min. Her oxygenation is measured at 84% on 100% non-rebreather mask and the decision is made to intubate. Since the time of admission she has received 5 liters of normal saline and has produced 3 liters of urine output. On examination, there is no evidence of jugular venous distention. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse bilateral crackles. Auscultation of the heart reveals normal heart sounds with no murmurs. A chest x-ray from the time of admission and one from the time of intubation are shown below:\nBased an these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "image": "",

      "A. Acute respiratory distress syndrome",
      "B. Hospital acquired pneumania",
      "C. latrogenic valume overload",
      "D. Congestive heart failure from myocardial infarction",
      "E. Alcohol induced dilated cardiomyopathy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient is mast likely suffering from ARDS secondary to acute pancreatitis. The twa most comman causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol and gallstones. Given her history, alcohal induced pancreatitis is mast likely. ARDS results from endothelial injury and the leakage of fluid fram capillaries; the fluid then fills the interstitial spaces and alveoli. ARDS results in intrapulmonary shunting, and therefare the hypoxia suffered by patients is typically refractory to oxygen administration. The alveoli are so full of fluid that they are unable to participate in gas exchange. The diagnostic criteria for ARDS include acute onset, a PaO2/FIO2 < 200, the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a Swan-Ganz pressure <18 mm Hg. ARDS is a farm af non-cardiogenic pulmanary edema, and shauld be distinguished from cardiogenic pulmanary edema, as accurs in congestive heart failure (CHF). A low Swan-Ganz pressure and the absence of JVD and cardiomegaly aid in distinguishing ARDS from CHF.\n(Choice B) Hospital acquired pneumania (HAP) is highly unlikely in the absence of fever, cough, sputum, and pleuritic chest pain. In addition, this is only the second day of hospitalization, and by definition HAP has an onset >=48 hours after admission.\n(Choice C) Acute pancreatitis is managed by providing the patient with large amounts of intravenous fluids and keeping the patient NFO. This patient has received 5L of intravenous fluids thus far with 3L of urine autput. This difference should nat result in fluid overload in a young and otherwise healthy patient.\n(Choice D) Absence of an S3 gallop, peripheral edema, and jugular venous distention make the diagnosis of congestive heart failure unlikely. A diagnosis of myocardial ischemia is also very unlikely in a relatively woung patient with no CAD risk factors and no chest pain.\n(Choice E) Our patient's CXR does not show cardiomegaly, which one would expect in the case of alcohol induced dilated cardiomyopathy. The acute onset and lack of edema or JVD also point against alcohol induced cardiomyopathy.\nEducational objective:\nThe diagnastic criteria for ARDS include acute onset, bilateral patchy airspace disease on CXR, PCWF <18 ar na clinical evidence of increased LVEDP, and PaO2/FIO2 <= 200."

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's pain, EKG findings, and cardiac markers are all consistent with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Of the above medications, nifedipine is the anly one not shawn to improve survival in STEMI patients. In fact, it is actually contraindicated in STEMI because it causes vasodilation and reflex tachycardia, which can warsen cardiac ischemia. MNon-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil can be used in STEMI patients and in patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms after beta-blockers have been administered, but even in that scenario they do not improve martality.\n(Choice A) Heparin is indicated in all acute Ml patients.\n(Choice B) Captapril is an ACE inhibitor, and has been shawn to improve martality in STEMI patients. This benefit is especially pronounced for patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and/or poor LY function.\n(Choice D) Beta-blockers like metaprolal are known to imprave martality in STEMI patients. This benefit is likely the result of their ability to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, prolong diastole (thereby increasing coronary perfusion), and reduce ventricular remodeling.\n(Choice E) Aspirin decreases platelet activity and has been shown to improve survival in STEMI patients. The pill should actually be chewed so that it can enter the blood stream mare quickly.\nEducational objective:\nDihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine can worsen cardiac ischemia since they cause peripheral vasodilation and reflex tachycardia; as such they are contraindicated in patients with acute coronary syndrome."

    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This woman mast likely has secandary hypertension due to Cushing's syndrome. High levels of cortisal enhance vasoconstriction, insulin resistance, and mineralocorticoid activity. This results in blood pressure elevation, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Proximal muscle weakness, central adiposity, thinning of the skin, weight gain, and psychiatric problems (e.g. sleep disturbances, depression, and psychaosis) are also comman in Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome may result from adrenal cortical hyperplasia, ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease), ectopic ACTH production, or fram administration of exogenous steroids.\n(Choice A) Renal parenchymal disease causes hypertension. However, parenchymal disease severe enough to cause hypertension should also cause a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. This patient's creatinine concentration is normal.\n(Choice B) Renal artery stenasis is an important cause of secondary hypertension. Usually due to atherosclerosis, renal artery stenosis generally presents with few systemic complaints and may be entirely asymptomatic. It would not explain this woman's weight gain, hypokalemia, ar hyperglycemia. A bruit may aften be heard upon auscultation of the affected renal artery.\n(Choice C) Aortic dissections present with tearing chest pain that radiates ta the back. They most commonly occur in patients with hypertension but are nat, themselves, causes of hypertension.\n(Choice D) Hypothyroidism causes weight gain, fatigue, bradycardia, depression, and skin and hair changes. It does not typically cause hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, or severe hypertension.\n(Choice E) Hyper- and hypoparathyroidism typically present with asymptomatic hyper- or hypocalcemia, respectively. Hyperparathyraidism may cause elevated blood pressure but this diagnosis is unlikely in a patient with a normal calcium concentration.\n(Choice G) Increased activity within the adrenal medulla would cause elevated catechalamine production (pheochromocytoma). Symptoms include weight loss, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphaoresis, and anxiety.\nEducational objective:\nCushing's syndrome is an important cause of secondary hypertension.

Amiodarone can cause a range of lung pathology including chronic interstitial pneumonitis, arganizing pneumonia, and even acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients with underlying lung disease, like the patient above, are more likely ta experience these side effects (possibly due to decreased pulmonary reserve). Amiodarone lung toxicity is related to the cumulative total dose administered. Though this is largely a diagnosis of exclusion, amiodarone should be discontinued if lung toxicity is suspected.\n(Choice A) Verapamil could be useful for slowing this patient's rapid ventricular rate.\n(Choice B) Digoxin would be a second-line choice for rate control here.

    "question": "A 37-year-old Cambodian woman presents ta the emergency room with acute onset of left-sided weakness. She has been experiencing progressive exertional dyspnea, nocturnal cough and occasional hemoptysis aver the past six months. She also describes frequent episodes of palpitations and irregular heart beats. Which of the following is the mast likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Mitral stenosis",
      "B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "C. Aartic insufficiency",
      "D. Wolf-Parkinsan-VWhite syndrome",
      "E. Primary pulmonary hypertension"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The most likely underlying diagnosis for all of this patient's symptoms is mitral stenasis secondary to rheumatic fever. The information that the patient is from Cambodia is helpful since rheumatic fever is mare comman in developing countries. The stenotic mitral valve causes an increase in the left atrial pressure which in turn gets transmitted to the pulmonary vascular bed. This increase in pulmanary vascular pressure causes pulmonary congestion which results in symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, nocturnal cough, and hemoptysis. Hemoptysis in particular should raise suspicion for mitral stenosis. Patients with mitral stenosis are at a high risk of developing atrial fibrillation due to left atrial dilation. The patient's episodes of palpitations and irregular heartbeats likely represent untreated atrial fibrillation. The patient in this scenario probably developed a thrombus in her left atrium secondary to untreated atrial fibrillation. The thrombus then embolized to her cerebral circulation causing a stroke and left-sided weakness.\n(Choice B) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is less likely to be the correct diagnosis. Syncope, angina, and palpitations are most typical of HCM. Hemaoptysis and nocturnal cough are less typical of HCM. Atrial fibrillation and strake may result from HCM, but this patient's other symptoms and the fact that she is from a developing country point towards rheumatic mitral stenosis.\n(Choice C) Aortic insufficiency can be associated with syphilis or rheumatic fever, bath of which have a higher incidence in developing countries. Aortic insufficiency could also possibly cause dyspnea and cough from pulmonary congestion. However, left atrial pressure is typically less elevated in aortic insufficiency than in mitral stenosis. Therefore, in aortic insufficiency there is a much lower likelihood of hemoptysis, atrial fibrillation and cardioembalic stroke.\n(Choice D) The patient's palpitations and irregular heart rate could possibly be explained by WPW, but since WPW causes a transient tachycardia it would be unlikely to cause progressive dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis over 6 manths.\n(Choice E) Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare disorder that is mare common in females in the fourth and fifth decades, so this patient is in the appropriate demographic. However, it involves the pulmanary arteries, so the left atrium is unaffected. Therefore, left atrial dilation and left atrial thrombus formation are unlikely in primary pulmonary hypertension.\nEducational objective:\nMitral stenosis results in left atrial dilation and a risk of atrial fibrillation and cardiac emboli. The pressure is also transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature, which can result in dyspnea, cough and hemoptysis."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The patient in this case scenario is presenting with features of cocaine intoxication. His age, presence of venous track marks, and EKG changes of myocardial ischemia are strong indicatars of cocaine abuse. Cocaine intoxication frequently presents with cardiac complications like ischemia and infarction due to its sympathomimetic effect. Tachycardia and hypertension are other features. Benzodiazepines are the first-line medication, along with aspirin, and nitrates in the treatment of cocaine-related cardiac ischemia. It allays the anxiety and reduces the hypertension and tachycardia that are associated with cacaine-induced cardiac ischemia. Aspirin retards thrombus formation, and nitrates, being vasodilators, are beneficial for the cacaine-induced coronary artery vasoconstriction.\n(Choice A) Cardiac catheterization should be performed in those patients with cocaine-related myocardial infarction. This patient has no evidence of myocardial infarction so far, so there is no need of emergency catheterization. Thrombalytics should be considered in ST elevation myocardial infarction (Choice C)\n(Choices B) Fure beta-blockers (metoprolol) would be contraindicated here, as they may aggravate the cocaine-mediated vasoconstriction. Otherwise, pure alpha blockers and calcium channel blockers can be added to nitrates if desired.\n(Choice D) Merely observing without any active intervention is likely to worsen and complicate the situation.\nEducational objective:\nIn the treatment of cocaine-related cardiac ischemia, the first-line drugs are benzodiazepines, nitrates, and aspirin."

    "question": "A 87-year-old man presents to the emergency department after losing consciousness while shoveling snow near his house. He reparts having had a similar episode one manth ago while carrying heavy bags from the grocery store. The patient has reduced his physical activity level over the last several months because of progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue. His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and hyperchalesteralemia. Metformin and simvastatin are his anly medications. Which of the following physical examination findings is mast likely in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Fulsus paradoxus",
      "B. Capillary pulsations",
      "C. Late diastolic murmur",
      "D. Systolic ejection murmur",
      "E. Pleural friction rub",
      "F. Opening snap"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Comman causes of exertional syncope include ventricular tachycardia and left ventricular outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis ar hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy). This patient's presentation is consistent with exertional syncope secondary to aortic stenosis (AS) because he also has symptoms of heart failure (fatigue, dyspnea an exertion). In general, AS becomes symptomatic when it is severe i.e with valve areas less than 1.0 cm2.\nOn physical exam, patients with AS have a systolic murmur typically heard best at the right second intercostal space. The murmur begins after S1 and terminates before S2, with an intensity dependent upan the degree of turbulence across the valve. The murmur classically radiates to the carotids. Palpation of the peripheral pulses reveals pulsus parvus et tardus (a pulse that rises gradually and has a delayed peak). There may also be a prolonged cardiac impulse palpated at the apex.\n(Choice A) Fulsus paradoxus refers to an exaggerated decrease (>=10 mmHg) in the systemic arterial blood pressure with inspiration. Classically, this phenomenon is seen in cardiac tamponade.\n(Choice B) Capillary pulsations in the fingers and lips may be observed in aortic regurgitation. Aartic regurgiation presents with chronic heart failure and is unlikely to cause exertional syncope.\n(Choices C and F) Late diastolic murmurs are heard most commonly in mitral stenosis. An opening snap is also characteristic of mitral stenosis. Patients present with pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice E) Fleural friction rubs indicate pleuritis. Pleuritis is not a cause of exertional syncope or heart failure.\nEducational Objective:\nThe typical symptoms af aortic stenosis are exertional dyspnea, syncope, and angina. The physical exam will reveal a systolic ejection murmur radiating to the apex and carotid arteries."

    "question": "A GE-year-old white male presents for evaluation of progressively worsening dyspnea that affects him at rest and wakes him fram sleep. He also notes bilateral ankle swelling. His medical history is significant for coronary artery disease for which he has undergone angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting. On examination today, his pulse is 86/min, blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, and respirations are 19/min. His neck veins are distended and there is bilaterally symmetric pitting ankle edema. On chest auscultation, you hear crackles at the bilateral lung bases and a third heart sound. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette and bilateral alveolar and interstitial pulmonary edema. Of the medications listed below, which has not been shawn to imprave survival in patients with the above presentation?",
    "options": [
      "A. Captopril",
      "B. Losartan",
      "C. Metoprolol",
      "D. Digoxin",
      "E. Aspirin",
      "F. Spironolactone"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Of the above medications, digoxin is the only one that does not improve survival in patients with CHF. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that helps increase the heart's contractility. It is therefore very useful for improving CHF symptoms like dyspnea and fatigue. Though it has no mortality benefit, digoxin has been shown to decrease hospitalizations in patients with CHF.\n(Choice A) Captopril is an ACE inhibitor shawn to improve mortality in CHF. [tis a first-line therapeutic agents.\n(Choice B) Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). ARBs have been shawn to improve survival in CHF, though to a lesser degree than ACE inhibitors. ARBs are typically reserved for patients unable to tolerate ACE inhibitars.\n(Choice C) Metoprolal is a beta-blocker shown to imprave martality in CHF | particularly in NYHA classes lI and lll. The beta-blockers carvedilol and bisoprolal also have a survival benefit in CHF, while beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity should be avoided.\n(Choice E) Given that this patient's CHF is likely due to his underlying coronary artery disease, aspirin would have a survival benefit far this patient by helping to prevent myacardial infarction.\n(Choice F) Loop diuretics are extensively used in patients with heart failure. However, they provide only symptomatic relief, not survival benefit. The anly class of diuretics with a demonstrated survival benefit in patients with heart failure is aldosterone antagonists like spironolactone and eplerenane. Use of spironolactone was associated with a 30% reduction in averall martality at twenty-four months in patients with MYHA class lll to IV heart failure wha were receiving an ACE inhibitor and loop diuretic (RALES trial).\nEducational objective:\nACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and spironolactone all confer a survival benefit in CHF. While digoxin and furosemide (loop diuretics) can reduce CHF symptoms and hospitalizations, they do not improve survival."

      "D. Lidocaine",
      "E. Digoxin",
      "F. Quinidine"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by lack of organized atrial activity. Itis a common complication of CABG, occurring in up to 40% of patients. In CABG with aartic valve replacement, the incidence jumps ta aver 50%. On EKG, AF is characterized by absent FP waves, an irregularly irregular rate, and a narrow GIRS complex. This patient has AF with rapid ventricular response.\nThe treatment of AF depends on a number of factors, most impartantly whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable (e.g. hypotension, altered mental status), immediate cardioversion is indicated. This patient's low blood pressure and crackles on lung examination demanstrate hemodynamic instability. Therefore, immediate cardioversion is indicated (Choice C). DC cardioversion is preferable to pharmacologic cardioversion (Choices A & F) in this setting because it has a higher success rate and is less likely to induce an arrhythmia. In a patient with recent-onset AF—as appears to be the case here—the success of cardioversion is approximately 90%.\n(Choice B) Transcutaneous pacing is most often used in the management of symptomatic bradycardia.\n(Choice D) Lidocaine is used far ventricular arrhythmias.\n(Choice E) Digoxin may be used for rate control in hemodynamically stable AF. However, immediate cardioversion—not rate control—is needed in hemodynamically unstable AF.\nEducational objective:\nFeatures of atrial fibrillation on EKG include an irregularly irregular R-R interval with absent P waves and narrow QRS complexes. In unstable patients immediate OC cardioversion should be performed."

He has never had pain like this before. He has no significant past medical history and he takes no medications. A routine health maintenance visit two weeks ago was normal. On physical examination in the ER, his blood pressure is 140/30 mmHg and his heart rate is 100/min. Chest auscultation reveals a grade [IV/VI] blowing systolic murmur at the cardiac apex and bibasilar crackles in the lungs. ECG shows ST segment elevations in leads I, aVL, and V1 - V5. Which of the following is most likely increased in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Left atrial pressure",
      "B. Left atrial size",
      "C. Left ventricular compliance",
      "D. Left ventricular ejection fraction",
      "E. Right ventricular preload"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient presents with an acute anterolateral myocardial infarction (AMI) and a murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation (MR). With an AMI, there may be papillary muscle ischemia ar rupture, which can cause secondary MR. (Classically, papillary muscle dysfunction occurs with posteroseptal MIs, due to the salitary blood supply of the posterior medial papillary muscle, but it can occur with AMIs as well. MR due to papillary muscle ischemia is sometimes reversed when the damaged myocardium is reperfused, but papillary muscle rupture requires emergent surgery.) In addition to acute MR, this patient has orthopnea and bibasilar crackles, signs of pulmonary edema — a comman sequela of MR. Measurement of his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with a Swan-Ganz catheter would reveal increased pressure in the left atrium.\n(Choice B) Chronic mitral regurgitation results in increased left atrial size as it dilates to accommodate chranically increased left atrial pressures. However, this process does not occur with acute-onset mitral regurgitation.\n(Choice C) Left ventricular compliance decreases with hypertrophy and increases with dilatation. Meither of these processes occurs with acute MR, though chronic MR will often cause left ventricular dilatation due to persistently elevated preloads.\n(Choice D) There is not a significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with acute mitral regurgitation. In chronic MR, the LVEF eventually decreases as the LV weakens and its compliance increases.\n(Choice E) Right ventricular preload is governed by systemic venous return and is not affected by acute MR.\nEducational objective:\nAcute mitral regurgitation can occur due to papillary muscle dysfunction in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Acute mitral regurgitation characteristically causes a rise in left atrial pressure without significant changes in left atrial size, left ventricular size ar left ventricular ejection fraction."

The first heart sound is loud and a mid-diastalic rumble is heard at the apex. Crackles are present in both lung fields. ECG shaws an irregularly, irregular heart rhythm and the absence of 'P' waves. Which of the following is the mast likely cause of this patient's abnarmal heart rhythm?",
    "options": [
      "A. Left atrial dilatation",
      "B. Right atrial dilatation",
      "C. Left ventricular dilatation",
      "D. Left ventricular hypertrophy",
      "E. Pulmonary hypertensian"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has mitral stenasis as a consequence of rheumatic heart disease. The mitral stenosis has in turn led to dilatation of her left atrium and resulted in atrial fibrillation. Rheumatic fever is more comman in patients from developing countries. While rheumatic fever can cause damage to any heart valve, mitral stenosis is the most comman valvular manifestation. The auscultative findings of a loud S1 and a mid diastalic rumbling murmur at the apex are classic for mitral stenosis. The pressure in the left atrium can become greatly elevated in order to compensate for the high resistance of the stenotic mitral valve. The increased pressure in the left atrium causes it ta dilate, which predisposes ta the development of atrial fibrillation. In fact, up to 70% of patients with mitral stenosis develop atrial fibrillation. The ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm and loss of 'P' waves describes atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation causes a lack of an \"atrial kick\", which could cause worsening flaw through the stenotic mitral valve and increased congestion in the lungs, thus leading to the patient's acute onset of dyspnea.\n(Choice B) Rheumatic fever can affect any valve, including the tricuspid valve. Tricuspid stenosis could lead to right atrial enlargement, which in turn would increase the patient's propensity to develop atrial fibrillation. However, the murmur of tricuspid stenosis would be most prominent at the left lower sternal border and symptams of right sided heart failure (peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, jugular venous distention) would predominate.\n(Choice C & D) The left ventricle is usually narmal in patients with mitral stenosis from rheumatic disease unless they have associated aortic valve disease.\n(Choice E) Mitral stenasis can result in secondary pulmonary venaus hypertension. However, mitral stenosis is the primary disease process in this patient, and the cause of atrial fibrillation.\nEducational objective:\nUp to 70% of patients with mitral stenosis will develop atrial fibrillation because of the significant left atrial dilatation."

    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought ta the ER 30 minutes after an episode where she lost consciousness. She is accompanied by her father who witnessed the event. He says that the patient recently broke up with her boyfriend and has been under a lot of stress. Her sleep has been poor. She has had three similar episodes aver the last month. On exam, her heart rate is 90/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. She seems sleepy but can be aroused easily. She gives her carrect name but is disariented to time and place. Fupils are symmetric and reactive to light. Blood glucose level is 100 mg/dL.

      "A. Systolic murmur that increases with standing",
      "B. Pulsus paradoxus",
      "C. Orthastatic hypotension",
      "D. Positive stool guaiac test",
      "E. Bitten tongue",
      "F. Unilateral calf swelling"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient is suffering from complex partial or generalized seizures. The key historical element that suggests that she had a seizure rather than a syncopal event is that she is confused following the episode. People who experience syncope should return to their baseline mental status immediately after regaining consciousness. This patient's continued confusion and disarientation are more consistent with a post-ictal state. Additionally, she has been stressed and sleeping poorly recently, twa common seizure triggers. Aside from altered sensaorium, other findings that would be suggestive of a seizure include tongue biting, and sore muscles. This patient needs to be evaluated for new-onset seizures with a CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, drug screen, EEG, and brain MRI\n(Choice A) A systolic murmur that increases with standing is characteristic of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM], a common cause of sudden death among young adults. Syncope associated with HOCM typically occurs during activity.\n(Choice B) Pulsus paradoxus is a physical exam finding of cardiac tamponade. Hypotension is required to diagnose cardiac tamponade and this patient is normotensive.\n(Choice C) Orthostatic hypotension is characterized by a drop in blood pressure after standing. Patients typically experience a lightheaded or presyncopal sensation prior to losing consciousness.\n(Choice D) A positive stool gquaiac test would indicate occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood loss can cause syncape via arthostatic hypotension. As described above, this patient's history is not suggestive of arthostatic hypotension.\n(Choice F) Unilateral calf swelling is often indicative of deep vein thrombosis. Pulmonary embali resulting from deep vein thromboses can cause syncope by increasing pulmanary arterial blood pressure and decreasing cardiac output. This patient does not have dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, or tachypnea to suggest a pulmonary embolus. Her age and lack af other risk-factars also makes DVT unlikely.\nEducational Objective:\nIt is essential to distinguish between a seizure and a syncopal event. A seizure resulting in loss of consciousness will often be followed by a post-ictal state of clouded sensarium, whereas people rapidly return ta their baseline mental status after a syncaopal event."

    "explanation": "Patient is most likely suffering from dissection of the aorta. Pregnancy is associated with dissection of aorta, probably due to changes in connective tissue associated with pregnancy. Other risk factors for dissection include a bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of aorta, and Marfan's syndrome. Aortic dissection is a medical emergency and should be diagnosed and treated. If hypertension is present it should be treated aggressively befare any diagnastic studies are done. ECG changes are due to invalvement of the caranary ostia (usually the right caronary artery), which lead ta inferior wall ischemia, manifested by the abnormalities on ECG.\nChoice (A): Obtaining cardiac enzymes is incorrect because the patient doesn't have any risk factors far an MI.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The physical exam finding of a heart murmur at the [eft lower sternal border that decreases with an increase in preload is classic for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The increased preload distends the myocardium and decreases the outflow obstruction fram the hypertrophied myocardium. This is in contrast to most murmurs, which typically are more severe with increased preload. The patient's young age and lack of coronary disease risk factors also points towards hypertrophic cardiomyopathy since this is more common in younger patients. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is more comman in African-Americans than whites as well. A variety af different genes for myocardial contractile proteins have been implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but all of them are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashian.\n(Choice E) Many common diseases are inherited in a multifactarial pattern, such as diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease.\nEducational objective:\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern."

He presented five days earlier with substernal chest pain and diapharesis. He has had no dyspnea, extremity swelling ar palpitations since admission. His past medical history is significant far diabetes mellitus type 2. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "F. Papillary muscle rupture",
      "G. Aortic dissection",
      "H. Acute pericarditis",
      "I. Ventricular aneurysm"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's rapid deterioration is most likely due ta ventricular free wall rupture and resulting pericardial tamponade. Ventricular free wall rupture can occur during remodeling of transmural infarcts. Like interventricular free wall rupture and papillary muscle rupture, this complication most cammonly presents between three to seven days after a myacardial infarction, but can occur up to twa weeks later. The majority af ventricular free wall ruptures occur in cases of anterior wall myocardial infarction, as is the case in this patient. The rapid onset of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is a common finding in left ventricular free wall rupture, and is a result of pericardial tamponade. As blood fills the pericardial sac, the left ventricle becomes compressed and stroke volume is compromised, resulting in hypotension. To compensate for decreased stroke volume, sinus tachycardia ensues. PEA is the result of severe mechanical compromise in this patient’s heart function. Rapid diagnosis and pericardiocentesis is needed to save the patient's life.\n(Choice A) Interventricular wall rupture is pathologically similar to ventricular free wall rupture and they bath have a peak incidence around five days after infarction. However. interventricular wall rupture causes a VSD and nat pericardial tamponade. The development of a new holosystolic murmur, rather than rapid development of pulseless electrical activity, is typical of interventricular wall rupture.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary infarction secondary to pulmonary embolism (PE) could conceivably occur in this patient. He is at risk far PE assuming he has been immobile since his Ml. While massive PE is a cause of pulseless electrical activity, it is the embolus itself and not pulmonary infarction which causes PEA.\n(Choice D) Recurrent ischemia is a possibility, but is more likely to cause a ventricular arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia ar ventricular fibrillation than to cause PEA.\n(Choice E) Right ventricular infarction is most common with inferior wall Ml. It presents with hypotension, but is unlikely to lead to such a rapid deterioration as is seen in this patient.\n(Choice F) Papillary muscle rupture has its peak incidence around 5 days after infarction and can cause hypatension secondary to severe acute mitral regurgitation. However, it would present with a new onset holasystolic murmur at the apex, and would be unlikely to cause the rapid decompensation seen in this patient.\n(Choice G) Aortic dissection can cause acute onset of chest pain and can even lead to acute pericardial tampanade if the dissection involves the aortic root. However, it is not a typical complication status post myocardial infarction.\n(Choice I) Ventricular aneurysm is a complication of anterior wall MI that can occur days to months after the initial infarction. It presents with akinesis af the involved portion of the left ventricular wall, ventricular arrhythmias, and systemic embolization.\nEducational objective:\nRupture of the ventricular free wall is a mechanical complication of Ml with peak incidence 3-7 days after anteriar wall Ml. Acute decompensation and PEA secondary to rapid development of tamponade is typical."

      "C. Simvastatin",
      "D. Ramipril",
      "E. Metformin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Sometimes, diagnosing coronary heart disease in a patient who presents with chest pain may be difficult. A thorough clinical history is essential during these instances, but additional investigations may alsa be necessary far making the diagnasis, estimating the prognosis, and guiding therapy. Coronary angiography is considered as the gold standard for diagnosis; however, it is invasive, expensive, and therefare not a suitable initial diagnostic test for most patients. For these reasons, exercise EKG testing is the most commonly performed non-invasive test for evaluating patients with stable angina.\nThe exercise EKG test has a high predictive accuracy, therefore, a positive test result is mare likely to be a true positive. The testis mast useful in patients with an intermediate pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). tis less useful in those with high and low probabilities of CAD. Patients with very high pretest probabilities far CAD (i.e., men over the age of 40 and women over the age of 60 with a history of typical angina) do not require exercise EKG testing for diagnosis. Similarly, patients with low pre-test probabilities (e.g., men under age 40 or women under age 50 with atypical chest pain) do not require EKG testing since such patients will give a relatively high false positive rate. Furthermore, an impartant precaution regarding exercise testing is that certain medications should be withheld prior to the test. These include anti-ischemic medications, digoxin, medications that slow the heart rate (e.g, beta-blockers), and any other drugs that can adversely affect the accuracy of the test. Current recommendations state that beta-blockers should be withheld 12-24 hours before the test. In this case, the patient fits inta the category of intermediate risk because of her age and atypical chest pain; therefore, arranging for an exercise EKG test and withholding atenolol prior to the test are appropriate.\n(Choices B, C, D, and E) Hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, ramipril, or metformin will not affect the result of the exercise EKG test.\nEducational Objective:\nExercise EKG testing is recammended for patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of angina based an clinical features and risk factors. Medications that should be withheld prior to testing include anti-ischemic medications, digoxin and medications that slow the heart (e.g., beta-blockers)."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question tests your knowledge of the management of hypertension, which includes non-pharmacologic therapy and pharmacologic therapy. Maon-pharmacalogic therapy ar lifestyle modification should be encouraged in all hypertensive patients regardless of the need far medication. Some of these lifestyle modifications include cessation of smoking, reduction in body weight, and sensible consumption of alcahal. This patient is consuming alcahal, and this could be partly why his blood pressure is sa difficult ta contral eventhough he has already been taking a thiazide diuretic and a beta-blocker for hypertension. The next best step is therefore be to help the patient reduce or eliminate his alcohol intake.\n(Choice C) In terms of pharmacologic therapy, several classes of medications are effective. In the absence af a specific indication ar contraindication, diuretics and beta-blockers are still recommended as the initial drug treatment. Although it is reasonable to increase the dose of the thiazide diuretic, reducing his alcohol intake is the best first step.\n(Choice B) Diabetics and patients with reduced LV systalic function should always be started an an ACE-inhibitor first. Cur patient has none of these specific indications. Fost-M| patients should be on a beta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor. Studies have shown that black patients respond better to diuretics and calcium channel blockers.\n(Choice A) There is no reason to admit this patient to the hospital.

Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 110/66 mmHg. Which of the following mast likely accounts far this patient's chest pain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Pulmanary artery distention",
      "B. Myocardial ischemia",
      "C. Pericardial inflammation",
      "D. Pleural infection",
      "E. Pulmonary infarction"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The patient in this vignette has pleuntic chest pain in the setting of prolonged immability, hemoptysis, dyspnea, tachycardia, and oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use. This combination is highly concerning for a pulmanary embolism. Pleuritic chest pain, or chest pain upon inspiration, occurs when the visceral and parietal pleurae of the lung become irritated and inflamed. One common cause of pleuritic chest pain is a pulmonary embalism with subsequent minor ar massive pulmanary infarction. Other comman causes include pneumania, pneumothorax, callagen vascular disease, viral pleuritis, and radiation pneumonitis. This patient has several risk factors for acute pulmanary embolism, and thus should be presumed to have a pulmanary embalism until proven otherwise. The diagnostic test of choice is a helical CT of the chest with IV contrast.\n(Choice A) Pulmonary artery distention can occur acutely in the setting of a pulmanary embolism due to a rapid increase in pulmonary artery pressure. It can alsa occur mare indalently in patients with primary or secondary pulmonary artery hypertension. The distention of pulmonary arteries is not thought to be a significant source of pain, and would be a very unlikely cause of pleuritic pain.\n(Choice B) The pain of myocardial ischemia is typically described as a substernal squeezing or pressure sensation. tis not classically pleuritic in nature. Moreover, this young woman does not have significant risk factors for myocardial ischemia.\n(Choice C) Pericardial inflammation (i.e. pericarditis) causes pleuritic chest pain. These patients will often be leaning forward in the exam room in arder to decrease their discomfort. This patient has mare risk factars for pulmonary embolism than pericarditis. Additionally, hemoptysis is a relatively cammoaon finding with pulmanary embolism, but is not characteristic of pericarditis.\n(Choice D) Fleural infections can certainly present with pleuritic chest pain. In fact, pneumaonia with ar without a parapneumanic effusion ar empyema is a leading cause of chest pain. However, this patient does not have a cough ar fever to further suggest a pulmonary infection.\nEducational Objective:\nPulmonary embolism is a common cause of pleuritic chest pain. It should be high in the differential of a young person presenting with pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and dyspnea, particularly if the patient is taking an OCP. One comman cause of pleuritic chest pain is a pulmonary embalism with subsequent minar ar massive pulmanary infarction."

    "question": "An 82-year-old male presents for evaluation of chronic back pain. On physical examination, he is found to have a blood pressure of 160/35 mmHg while supine and 135/70 mmHg while standing. He is otherwise healthy; his only medicine is occasional ibuprofen for back pain. Which of the following age-related changes best explains the observed finding?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increased left ventricular wall stiffness",
      "B. Decreased left ventricular contractility",
      "C. Decreased baroreceptor responsiveness",
      "D. Decreased stress-mediated catecholamine release",
      "E. Decreased glomerular filtration rate"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has orthostatic hypotension, which is defined as a postural decrease in blood pressure by 20 mmHg systolic ar 10 mmHg diastolic (sometimes accompanied by an increase in heart rate) that occurs on standing. In general, orthostatic hypotension results from insufficient constriction of resistance and capacitance blood vessels in the lower extremities on standing, which may be due to a defect in autonomic reflexes, decreased intravascular volume, or medications. Some baroreceptor sensitivity is lost as a normal part of aging. Arterial stiffness, decreased norepinephrine content of sympathetic nerve endings, and reduced sensitivity of the myocardium to sympathetic stimulation all contribute to a tendency toward arthostatic hypotension with age.\n(Choices A & B) Normal changes to the aging heart include decreased resting and maximal cardiac output, decreased maximum heart rate, increased contraction and relaxation time of heart muscle, increased myocardial stiffness during diastole, decreased myocyte number, and pigment accumulation in myocardial cells.\n(Choice D) The adrenal medulla continues to release catecholamines in respanse to stress (fight or flight) throughout life. The adrenal medulla does not participate in the fine control of blood pressure.\n(Choice E) While the GFR does tend to decline with old age, a decreased GFR would promote sodium retention and expansion of the intravascular volume, counteracting arthostatic hypatensian.\nEducational objective:\nFrogressively decreasing baroreceptor sensitivity and defects in the myocardial response to this reflex are the main reasons for the increased incidence of orthostatic hypotension in the elderly."

    "question": "A 84-year-old diabetic with a long history of uncontrolled hypertension is admitted for chest pain. ECG reveals elevated ST segments in the anterior wall leads. Cardiac enzymes are elevated and the patient is admitted to the ICU for supportive care. He receives low molecular weight heparin and is placed on a nitroglycerin drip. He continues ta have chest pain and requires intravenous marphine. Three days later, the patient is transferred ta the floor and he remains an bed rest. During the night the nurse an call informs you that the patient has a cold leg. On examination, the left leg is cold and there are no distal pulses. There is minimal swelling and the leg appears mottled. Emergency vascular surgery consult was placed and the appropriate treatment was given. Which of the following should also be considered in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Venous duplex study",
      "B. Chest x-ray",
      "C. Echocardiogram",
      "D. V/Q scan",
      "E. D-dimer level"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "From the above scenario, it appears that the patient had a Ml. The patient is treated with law malecular weight heparin. He later suffers a cold leg. This is a mechanical complication resulting fram an embolus from the left ventricle. When the Ml is large, a thrombus can form and embolize, generally to the legs. ECHO is used to make a diagnosis of a thrombus. The Ml results in blood stasis in the akinetic part of the heart with resultant thrombus formation. The thrombus in the left ventricle if identified early, is treated with heparin and ECHO follow-up.\nChoice A: Venous duplex study is an errar. The leg is cold and without pulses which indicates an arterial occlusion. Venous obstruction will present with a swollen leg and the pulses will be present. In the setting of an Ml and administration of heparin, the chances of a OVT are law.\nChoice B: The chest x-ray in the above patient is non-diagnastic. If the patient did become shart of breath, ane may get a chest x-ray to rule out CHF.\nChoice D: V/( scan is done to rule out the possibility of a PE. In the above patient there are na respiratory symptoms and the probability of a DVT in the presence of heparin is law. However, in patients with an Ml wha do not receive any blood thinners and remain at bed rest are prone to formation of DVT.\nChoice E: D-dimer is a very sensitive test for detecting thrombus formation but it is very nonspecific and is usually elevated in many hospitalized patients. It has nao diagnostic utility in this situation.\nEducational objective:\nIn a patient with an Ml who develops a cold leg, one has to get an ECHO to rule out a thrombus in the left ventricle."

    "question": "A GBB-year-old male is rushed to the emergency department because he feels dizzy and light-headed. He denies chest pain or palpitations. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes. His blood pressure is 116/62 mm Hg and his pulse is 35-40/min. He is alert, awake, and fully oriented. He is breathing comfortably and does not appear to be in any distress. His extremities are slightly cold and capillary refill is 3 seconds. His EKG is shown below.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Intravenous adenosine",
      "B. Intravenous atrapine",
      "C. Intravenous epinephrine",
      "D. Intravenous amiodarone",
      "E. Transcutaneous pacing"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "At rest, the normal heart rate ranges from 60-100 beats per minute. This patient's symptoms, heart rate, and EKG are consistent with sinus bradycardia, which is identified on EKG as a heart rate <= 60 with regular rhythm and a constant PR interval. Sinus bradycardia is associated with excellent physical conditioning, exaggerated vagal activity, sick sinus syndrome, hypoglycemia, and certain medications (eg, digitalis, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers). Mast individuals with sinus bradycardia are asymptomatic, but some develop dizziness, light-headedness, syncope, fatigue, and worsened angina. In symptomatic patients, the administration of intravenous atropine is the proper first step in management. Atropine provides an immediate increase in the heart rate by decreasing vagal input.\n(Choice A) The administration of intravenous adenosine causes temparary AV block, which is useful in identifying — and in some cases, terminating — supraventricular tachycardias. Adenosine has no role in the management of bradycardia.\n(Choice C) In hemodynamically unstable patients with sinus bradycardia, the use of epinephrine is appropriate. While this patient's capillary refill is slowed, his blood pressure is adequate.\n(Choice D) Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic used in many cases of supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Amiodarone is not used in cases of bradycardia because it slows the SA and AY nodes. Consequently, it could warsen this patient's symptoms.\n(Choice E) Transcutaneous pacing is the next step after atropine, as it provides a sustained increase in heart rate. At that point, the identification and reversal of the underlying etiology of the sinus bradycardia is essential. If a medication is responsible, it should be replaced with an alternative therapy that is not associated with bradycardia. Permanent pacemakers may be required in those individuals with chronic symptomatic sinus bradycardia.\nEducational objective:\nSymptomatic sinus bradycardia should be treated with intravenous atropine, followed by transcutaneous pacing. Medications that slow the heart rate should be replaced with alternative therapeutic regimens. If the bradycardia does nat resolve, a permanent pacemaker may be necessary."

      "C. Occlusion of the left anterior descending artery",
      "D. Inflammation of the pericardium"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has clear evidence of ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) suggesting acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. Inferior wall myocardial infarction results fram the occlusion of either the right caranary artery or the left circumflex artery. In most studies with acute inferior myocardial infarction, the culprit lesion was in the right coronary artery than in the left circumflex artery with a ratio of 4-5:1. Also, remember that in patients with inferior myocardial infarction who have right ventricular infarction, the culprit artery virtually always is the right coronary artery. This patient has bradycardia and hypotension suggesting involvement of SA node and right ventricle; so, in this case itis mast likley a RCA occlusion.\n(Choice C) Left anterior descending artery occlusion causes anterior wall myocardial infarction.\n(Choice D) Pericarditis will have diffuse ST elevation in all leads.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most likely culprit lesion for acute inferior wall myacardial infarction is right caranary artery occlusion, especially If it is complicated by right ventricular infarction (hypotension) and bradycardia.\n*Extremely high yield question far USMLE!"

      "A. Urine metanephrines",
      "B. Abdominal ultrasound",
      "C. Captopril-enhanced radionuclide renal scan",
      "D. Aldosterane:renin ratio",
      "E. 24-hour urine cortisol measurement"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient mast likely has polycystic kidney disease (PED) and should undergo abdominal ultrasonography. PKD is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by bilateral cystic dilation of the renal tubules. Hypertension is one of the earliest manifestations of the disease. Hematuria is often the presenting symptom. Other signs and symptoms include flank or abdominal masses, pain, secondary erythrocytosis due to increased erythropoietin production, and renal failure. PKD is associated with cerebral aneurysms and patients with PKD may have a family history of stroke ar sudden death. PKD is easily diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography.\n(Choices A, D & E) Urine metanephrines are used to diagnose a pheochromocytoma. An elevated aldosterone to renin ratio would suggest primary hyperaldosteronism, a leading cause of secandary hypertension. A 24-hour urine cortisol measurement is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal masses are almost never palpable.\n(Choice C) A captopril renal scan is used to diagnose renal artery stenosis. This typically presents with refractory hypertension but few other symptoms. It does not cause bilateral kidney enlargement.\nEducational objective:\nFPalycystic kidney disease is a relatively common autosomal dominant disease. It typically presents with hematuria and hypertension but may also cause abdominal masses and pain. It is associated with intracerebral aneurysms."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man complains of frequent chest pain. The pain typically occurs at night and is described as retrosternal and burning in quality. He leads a sedentary lifestyle but does not smoke or drink alcohal. His past medical history includes a chronic cough and occasional hoarseness. He does not take any medications. His BMI is 28.5 kg/m². ECG stress testing reveals 1 mm ST segment depression in the inferior leads at 90% of predicted maximal heart rate. He did not experience chest pain during the stress test. Which of the following is most likely to relieve this patient's chest pain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ibuprofen",
      "B. Mitroghycerin",
      "C. Propranolal",
      "D. Alprazalam",
      "E. Omeprazole",
      "F. Amitriptyline"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has symptoms most consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He has the standard finding of retrosternal burning (i.e, heartburn) that is worse when he lies down and is not associated with exertion. Classically, patients may report symptoms 30-60 minutes after eating and describe relief with antacids. This patient also has a chronic cough due to reflux of gastric secretions into the lungs, and hoarseness resulting from reflux-induced laryngitis. Medical treatment includes either H2-receptar antagonists (e.g., ranitidine} or praton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole). Patients refractory to medical therapy may require surgical fundoplication or endoscopic treatment. The long-term consequences of GERD can include Barrett's esophagus and esophageal carcinoma.\n(Choice A) Ibuprofen is an excellent analgesic for patients with musculoskeletal chest pain. A musculoskeletal etiology of chest pain would not account for his cough or hoarseness.\n(Choice B) Mitroglycerin is a good treatment for angina pectoris. There are several reasons to think that this patient's chest pain does not reflect angina. First, his discomfart is not associated with activity. Second, the character of his pain is burning, whereas cardiac chest pain is more typically a squeezing or pressure sensation. It's true that he may have coronary disease. His ECG stress test revealed ST depressions in an anatomic distribution, the typical cut off for a positive test being 1 mm. However, 10-30% of people with 1 mm depression will not have significant coronary disease, and his ECG changes did not appear until near-maximal exertion.\n(Choice C) Beta blockers are indicated in acute myocardial infarctions, heart failure, and chranic angina. They will not be of significant benefit in GERD.\n(Choice D) Alprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine beneficial in treating panic attacks and anxiety disorders. Classic chest pain resulting from anxiety is characterized by a sense of impending doom, tachypnea, and numbness of the lips and digits.\n(Choice F) Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat depression, insomnia, and neuropathic pain.\nEducational Objective:\nGERD is characterized by a retrosternal burning sensation after eating and with lying down. It may also be accompanied by hoarseness and chronic cough, especially while recumbent. The initial treatment is an Hz-receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor."

She has no history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or heart disease, and she does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. On physical examination, her pulse is irregular. There are no murmurs. Her lungs are clear to auscultation and her legs are free of edema. An EKG shows atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute. An echocardiogram is unremarkable except for evidence of atrial fibrillation. What is the most appropriate management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Warfarin and clopidogrel",
      "B. Heparin followed by warfarin",
      "C. Low-malecular weight heparin",
      "D. Aspirin alone",
      "E. Warfarin to maintain an INR of 2 to 3"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Patients with atrial fibrillation are at risk for development of mural thrombi and subsequent embolic stokes. Thus, anticoagulation therapy is generally recommended far these patients. In patients with atrial fibrillation wha are otherwise healthy, like the woman in the vignette abave, anticoagulation with aspirin alone is sufficient. However, in patients with atrial fibrillation and additional risk factars far stroke (histary of strake ar TIA, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, age >= 75 years, valvular heart disease), the risk of future embalic stroke is increased, and anticoagulation with warfarin is generally necessary.\n(Choice A) Clopidogrel does not have a role in preventing thrombotic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation. Rather, it is indicated for preventing in-stent thromboses following coronary artery stenting.\n(Choice B) When starting warfarin therapy, it takes at least 3-4 days to achieve appropriate levels of anticoagulation. In fact, warfarin therapy may actually cause hypercoagulability initially. (This is because the first vitamin K-dependent factars to be lost are proteins C and 5, which are both anticoagulants) In arder to provide anticoagulation during this window of time patients are often “bridged” with a heparin product.\n(Choice C) Low-malecular weight heparins are very effective anticoagulants in treating venous thromboembolism and acute coronary syndrome and may play a role in bridging patients starting warfarin therapy in other settings. However, these agents are expensive and are not ideal for long-term treatment of atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice E) Warfarin with a goal INR of 2-3 is the recommendation for patients who have atrial fibrillation and ather risk factors for stroke as discussed above. In patients without other risk factars for stroke, such as the patient in the vignette the risk of bleeding while on warfarin outweighs its potential benefits.\nEducational objective:\n“Lane atrial fibrillation” is atrial fibrillation in the absence of other risk factors for stroke, such as a previous strake or TIA, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, age >= 75 years, or valvular heart disease. Aspirin is the only antithrombotic therapy required far patients with lone atrial fibrillation."

    "question": "A middle-aged man was recently diagnosed with hypertension. The antihypertensive medication prescribed to him enhances natriuresis, decreases serum angiotensin Il concentration, and decreases aldosterone production. This medication most likely belongs to which of the following drug classes?",
    "options": [
      "A. Angiotensin receptor blocker",
      "B. Direct renin inhibitor",
      "C. Aldosterone receptor antagonist",
      "D. Loop diuretic",
      "E. Alpha-adrenergic blocker"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is of critical impartance in understanding hypertension. To review, renin is produced in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to hypoperfusion. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. In turn, angiotensin I is converted into angiotensin Il by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the lung. Angiotensin Il is a potent vasoconstrictor. It also promotes vasopressin (ADH) release from the pituitary and aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts to promote sodium and water resorption from the kidneys. The net result of activation of this system is an increase in blood pressure, total body sodium, total body water, and blood volume.\nThe medication in this vignette increases natriuresis, decreases serum angiatensin Il concentration, and decreases aldosterone production. Of the listed medications, anly a direct renin inhibitor will cause these changes.\n(Choice A) Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prevent angiotensin Il from acting on angiotensin receptors. They do not decrease angiotensin Il levels but do cause natriuresis and decreased aldosterone production.\n(Choice C) Aldosterone receptor antagonists do not decrease angiotensin Il concentration ar aldosterone production, but they do induce natriuresis.\n(Choice D) Loop diuretics induce natriuresis but do not decrease angiotensin Il or aldosterone concentrations.\n(Choice E) Alpha-adrenerqgic blockers are direct vasodilators used to treat hypertension. They decrease blood pressure but do not decrease angiotensin ll or aldosterone concentrations, nor do they induce natriuresis.\nEducational objective:\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is integrally involved in the pathophysiology and treatment of hypertension. Numerous antihypertensives perturb this system and understanding haw different agents affect it is impartant."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Chronic venous insufficiency is a leading cause of lower extremity edema. Thought to result fram incompetence of the valves in the lower extremity veins, venous insufficiency causes manifestations ranging fram mild varicasities to leq pain, severe edema, stasis dermatitis, skin fibrosis, ulceration, and immability. Risk factars for venous insufficiency include age, female gender, obesity, a history of lower extremity surgery, and a history of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Leg elevation, compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression dressings can all help to decrease the edema. Skin fibrosis and ulcerations require more intensive medical management.\n(Choice A & E) Smoking cessation and oxygen therapy will improve edema that is secondary ta right heart failure. However, this patient does not have other evidence of car pulmanale such as elevated jugular venous pressure ar ascites.\n(Choice C & D) Blood pressure contral and salt restriction can help alleviate edema secondary to left heart failure. Crackles on lung auscultation and/ar jugular venous distention would suggest this diagnosis.\nEducational objective:\n“enous insufficiency results from incompetence of the valves within the lower extremity veins.

      "F. Esophageal perforation",
      "G. Aortic dissection"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient is presenting with a spontaneous esophageal rupture, or Boerhaave's syndrome. The classic presentation is acute, severe chest or epigastric pain after an episode of retching. Fever and dyspnea are comman but hematemesis, when present, is not a prominent feature. The physical exam can be non-specific but often involves tachycardia, tachypnea, subcutaneous emphysema, and unilaterally decreased breath sounds. Signs of shock may be present. Radiologic studies can reveal a unilateral pleural effusion (usually left), subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema (widened mediastinum), and contrast extravasation from the esophagus after a swallow study. The pleural fluid will have a high amylase concentration, low pH, and may contain particles of food.\n(Choice A) Acute pancreatitis can cause a unilateral, left-sided pleural effusion with a high amylase concentration. However, pancreatitis should not cause widening of the mediastinum. Chest pain would be unusual in pancreatitis, which classically presents as epigastric pain radiating to the back.\n(Choice B) Peptic ulcer disease typically presents as epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and an upper Gl bleed. The symptoms are usually mare chronic than the patient's symptoms in this vignette. Feptic ulcer disease would not cause a unilateral pleural effusion with an elevated amylase concentration.\n(Choice C) Pneumonia can present with a unilateral pleural effusion due to an empyema or parapneumaonic effusion. However, this vignette does not describe an infiltrate on chest x-ray and the patient does not complain of cough. If this patient's effusion were secondary to infection, pleural fluid analysis would be expected to show many white blood cells, increased protein, and increased LOH, but not an elevated amylase level.\n(Choice D) A myocardial infarction certainly needs to be in the differential diagnosis for any patient with chest pain. This patient has been using cocaine, which can cause vasospasm and lead to a myocardial infarction in otherwise healthy people. However, his EKG is normal and an Ml would nat account far his unilateral pleural effusion or widened mediastinum.\n(Choice E) Pulmonary embali are a common cause of chest pain and unilateral pleural effusion. The effusion, however, will not have a high amylase concentration. Nausea and vomiting are not typical with pulmanary embali.\n(Choice G) Cocaine use can predispose him to have an aortic dissection, which classically presents as tearing chest pain radiating ta the back with a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray. However, aortic dissection is not associated with a pleural effusian.\nEducational Objective:\nSpontaneous rupture of the esophagus (Boerhaave's syndrome) is a rare and dangerous condition. It typically occurs after severe retching and presents as chest or epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and unilateral pleural effusion."

Any patient in cardiac arrest with a non-shockable rhythm (anything other than WYFA/T) should immediately receive CFR including manual chest compressions, establishment of a definitive airvay and ventilation with 100% oxygen. IMPORTANT! Unlike ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation is NOT a shockable rhythm during cardiac arrest with no palpable pulses!

It is important to make the diagnosis of PEA as there are a variety of potentially treatable causes (can be remembered asthe 6 Hs and 6 Ts):\nHs: hypovalemia, hypoxia, hydrogen ions (acidosis), hypothermia, hypoglycemia, hyperfhypokalemia\nTs: tamponade (cardiac), tension pneumathorax, thrombosis (MI, PE), trauma (hypovolemia), tablets (drugs) and toxins.\n(Choice A) Synchronized electrical cardioversion may be used to canvert patients with perfusing tachyarrhythmias who are experiencing signs and symptoms of serious hemodynamic compromise. BUT those patients are NOT in full cardiac arest (no pulse or blood pressure)!\n(Choice B) Defibrillation is utilized as early as possible in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), but NOT in atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice C) In a patient with FEA, epinephrine 1 mg IV ar vasopressin 40U IV would be the first-line pharmacalogic interventions after CPR is initiated. Lidocaine may be used for patients with VF or VT who remain in cardiac arrest after three shacks.\n(Choice E) An arterial blood gas to assess for hypoxemia or acidemia, which can both promote PEA, would pravide useful information, but CPR and pharmacalogic intervention take precedence.\nEducational objective:\nA patient in cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity requires immediate initiation of CPR including manual chest compressions."

    "question": "A 24-year-old male experiences syncope while shoveling snow. He regained consciousness within ane minute. He has been having some shartness of breath and chest pains recently, mostly related to exercise. He denies any illicit drug use. His temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F), and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows a well built male in no apparent distress. Lungs are clear. A crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur is heard along the left sternal border without carotid radiation. Chest X-ray is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his syncopal episode?",
    "options": [
      "A. Atrioventricular conduction delay",
      "B. Left ventricular hypertrophy",
      "C. Aortic dissection",
      "D. Coronary atherosclerosis",
      "E. Mitral valve degeneration"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur along with left sternal barder without carotid radiation is the description of the murmur present in hypertrophic cardiomyapathy, hence left ventricular hypertrophy is the carrect answer. The location of the murmur and lack of carotid radiation helps to differentiate from aortic stenosis. Common symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy include syncope, dyspnea, and chest pain; all af which this patient has experienced. Syncope in HCMP is multifactorial. In large part it is due to outflow abstruction from the hypertrophied myocardium. However, syncope can alsa be secondary to arrhythmia, ischemia, and a ventricular baroreceptor response that inappropriately causes vasodilation.\n(Choice A) Atrioventricular conduction delay occurs when canduction through the AV node is slowed, typically due to medications such as B-Blockers ar ischemic heart disease. This typically results in bradycardia, but this patient's heart rate is within the normal range.\n(Choice C) Syncope can occur with aortic dissection, particularly with those involving the ascending aorta. However, the primary complaint in patients with aortic dissection is chest pain, which this patient does not appear to have at the current time. Painless aortic dissection is rare. Most patients with aortic dissection are also older and hypertensive.\n(Choice D) Coronary atherosclerosis is unlikely in a patient this young without any underlying coranary disease risk factors. It would also be unlikely to cause a murmur by itself.\n(Choice E) Mitral degeneration leading to regurgitation rarely causes syncope. In addition, mitral regurgitation typically causes a holosystalic murmur as apposed to the crescendo-decrescendo type murmur heart in this patient.\nEducational objective:\nSyncope in a young patient with a crescendo-decrescenda murmur at the lower left sternal border is most likely due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Syncope in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is often multifactorial and can be due to outflow obstruction, arrhythmia, ischemia, and a ventricular baroreceptor response that inappropriately causes vasodilation."

      "C. Complete heart block",
      "D. Atrial fibrillation",
      "E. First degree heart block"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Wenckebach or Mabitz type I heart block is characterized by a narrow QRS, progressive increase in PR interval until a ventricular beat is dropped, then the sequence is repeated. It may be seen after digitalis toxicity, increased vagal tone, and inferior wall myocardial infarction. It can occur in narmal subjects, athletes and older adults. It is also associated with structural heart disease affecting the AV node. Treatment includes observation in asymptomatic patients, correction of reversible causes (e.g., holding medications that affect AV node conduction) and, uncommonly, cardiac pacing.\n(Choice B) In type Il block, the PR interval remained unchanged prior ta the 'F' wave and it suddenly failed to conduct to the ventricles. So, you will see a dropped 'QRS' complex with normal 'FR' interval. If you look at the lead Il in the above EKG, PR interval is progressively prolonged and it is followed by a dropped beat, which is type-l Mobitz block not the type Il Mobitz\n(Choice C) In third degree AV block, no atrial impulses will travel ta ventricles. So, atria and ventricles beat independently and have their respective rates.\n(Choice D) In atrial fibrillation the heart rate is irregularly irregular and you will not see any 'P' waves.\n(Choice E) First-degree heart black is characterized by a prolonged constant 'FPR' interval (>=0.2s). There will not be any dropped beat.\nEducational objective:\nWenckebach or Mobitz type I heart block is characterized by a narrow QRS, progressive increase in PR interval until a ventricular beat is dropped, then the sequence is repeated. Itis a benign arrhythmia and is transient. Unless the patient is symptomatic, it requires na treatment."

His past medical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension. Which of the following physical findings is most consistent with this patient's clinical presentation?",
    "options": [
      "A. Fixed splitting of S2",
      "B. Ejection-type systolic murmur",
      "C. Friction rub",
      "D. Fourth heart sound",
      "E. Pulsus paradoxus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is presenting with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). He has typical symptoms (substernal chest pain with radiation to the left neck, diaphoresis, and shortness af breath) and is at high risk far atherosclerotic vascular disease (diabetes, hypertension). The large meal he ate before going to bed is a distraction because gastroesophageal reflux disease will not cause diaphoresis and shortness of breath. The cardiac exam can vary significantly in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but a new fourth heart sound is ane classic finding of MI. Ischemic damage in the setting of Ml may lead to diastolic dysfunction and a stiffened left ventricle, resulting in an atrial gallop (fourth heart sound).\n(Choice A) Fixed splitting of S2 is found in patients with an atrial or ventricular septal defect. Itis nota physical exam finding of acute ischemia.\n(Choice B) Ejection-type systolic murmurs typically reflect turbulent blood flow through the aortic ar pulmanic valves. Ejection murmurs are nat strongly associated with acute myocardial infarction.\n(Choice C) Friction rubs are seen in patients with pericarditis. This patient's symptoms are mare consistent with an acute myacardial infarction than with pericarditis.\n(Choice E) Pulsus paradoxus refers to a significant drop in systolic blood pressure with inspiration. It occurs in patients with cardiac tamponade. This patient has chest pain and cardiac tamponade is nat typically painful, however.\nEducational objective:\nIschemic damage in the setting of Ml may lead to diastolic dysfunction and a stiffened left ventricle, resulting in an atrial gallop (fourth heart sound)."

    "question": "A 68-year-ald male is hospitalized following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction that was treated with thrombolytic therapy 4 days ago. On day 4 of his hospitalization, he develops recurrent chest pain, similar in quality and severity ta his previous pain. Sublingual nitroglycerin is administered but does not help. His blood pressure is now 140/90 mmHg and his heart rate is 82/min. S1 and S2 are normal, and there are no cardiac murmurs or rubs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following laboratory tests would be most useful to send in this setting?",
    "options": [
      "A. Troponin T",
      "B. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)",
      "C. CK-MB",
      "D. Alkaline phosphatase"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's current symptoms are likely due to re-occlusion of his left anterior descending (LAD) artery fram failed thrombalysis. The key clue is that his current chest pain is identical to his pain at presentation. Generally speaking, troponin T is the most sensitive and specific test in the setting of a myocardial infarction, but it is slow to return to normal. In contrast, CK-MB levels normalize mare rapidly (within 1 ar 2 days), so a CE-MB elevation now wauld be suspicious far new ischemia. Of course, a repeat EKG should alsa be obtained since new ST changes may be seen if reinfarction is occurring.\n(Choice A) As described above, troponin T takes up to 10 days to return to normal, so itis not a helpful diagnostic toal in evaluating chest pain in a patient with a myocardial infarction that occurred 4 days ago.\n(Choice B) In the past, LDH was used as a marker of cardiac injury. Now, troponin T and CK-MB are measured instead as they are more specific for cardiac tissue.\n(Choice D) Alkaline phosphatase is a marker of biliary and/or bone pathology, not of cardiac injury.\nEducational objective:\nCK-MB is the mast useful lab test in assessing for coronary re-occlusion after an Ml because it typically returns to normal levels within 1-2 days. While troponin T is generally a more sensitive marker for cardiac injury, it takes up to 10 days to return ta normal after an Ml, making elevations difficult to interpret in this sort of scenario."

    "question": "A 64-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. An ECG reveals ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF. Thrombolytic therapy and heparin are administered, and the pain resolves. Eight hours after admission, the patient develops hypotension. He denies recurrence of chest pain. His temperature is 37.8°C (99.6°F), blood pressure is 84/55 mm Hg, pulse is 30/min, and respirations are 15/min. His medications include a nitroglycerin drip, beta-blocker, aspirin, heparin, and simvastatin. Examination reveals an elevated jugular venous pressure of 14 cm, cold clammy extremities, and clear lung fields. Based an this information, what is the next best step in this patient's management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Start dopamine",
      "B. Administer normal saline bolus and stop nitroglycerin",
      "C. Administer intravenous furosemide",
      "D. Initiate temporary cardiac pacing",
      "E. Stop nitroglycerin and start dobutamine drip"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The ST elevations in leads II, III, and AVF indicate that this patient has suffered an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). Acute management of an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) generally includes reperfusion (thrombolysis or percutaneous angioplasty), antiplatelet therapy, morphine, heparin, nitrates, and beta-blockers. Nitrates and beta-blockers are contraindicated in certain circumstances, however. Nitrates are not indicated in the setting of aortic stenosis, recent phosphodiesterase inhibitor use, ar right ventricular infarction (which occurs in mare than 30% of cases of inferior wall MI). While left ventricular infarctions severe enaugh to cause hypotension also present with pulmanary edema, right ventricular infarctions present with clear lung fields. Jugular venous distention and hypotension are also frequently seen in the setting of a significant RY infarct, as in this patient. When the right ventricular stroke volume decreases, cardiac output is impaired. Therefare, any medication that reduces preload (eg, nitrates ar diuretics) will exacerbate rather than improve symptoms. The first step in the treatment of right ventricular MI is generally IV fluid resuscitation to increase the RY stroke volume and enhance left ventricular filling.\n(Choices A and E) When fluid resuscitation does not improve hemodynamics, dobutamine may be used to increase cardiac output through inotropic and chronotropic stimulation. However hypotensive patients should also receive dopamine because dobutamine can warsen hypotension if given alone.\n(Choice C) Intravenous furosemide would be inappropriate because it would decrease the preload in this patient.\n(Choice D) Right ventricular stroke volume is constant, and therefore the output of the right ventricle (RY) depends on the heart rate. In cases of BY myocardial infarction complicated by bradycardia, temporary pacing is used to optimize BY output. This patient, hawewer, is not bradycardic.\nEducational objective:\nClear lung fields, hypotension, and jugular venous distension in the setting of an inferior wall Ml are suggestive af an BY infarct. Fluid resuscitation is the appropriate management, and nitrates should be avoided."

      "G. Addison's disease",
      "H. Cardiac tamponade",
      "I. Tension pneumothorax"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is suggestive of an anaphylactic reaction caused by latex. Widespread use of latex in medical products have made it a cammon cause of allergy. The hypotensive episode that developed in this patient while having sex with her partner was mast probably caused by an allergic reaction ta latex contained in condoms. Latex gloves used by surgeons (or during pelvic examinations) provoked a second episade af anaphylactic reaction. Latex allergy is particularly commaon (18 to 73 percent) in individuals with spina bifida.\nBlood loss (choice A) and pulmanary embalism (choice E) can cause hypotension, but do nat cause a rash.\nCoagulation abnormalities (choice B) like DIC may cause hypotension due to excessive bleeding from the aperative site and venous punctures. Septic shock (choice D) is characterized by fever, and an established focus of infection is usually present.\nAddison's disease (Choice G) should also be suspected in any patient who suddenly becomes hypotensive under a stressful condition such as surgery. However, a sudden onset of rash is not seen with Addison's disease. Patients can have hyperpigmentation, not a sudden onset of generalized rash.\nEducational objective:\nLatex allergy can manifest as an anaphylactic reaction during exposure to latex-containing products such as surgical gloves and condoms."

His medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and major depressive disorder. He cannot remember his medication list at this time. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 127/74 mm Hg and his heart rate is 102/min. His left lower extremity is cool and pale below the level of the knee. Neither the posteriar tibial nor the dorsalis pedis pulse is palpable. Which medication could have prevented this acute problem?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aspirin",
      "B. Metoprolol",
      "C. Clopidogrel",
      "D. Warfarin",
      "E. Diltiazem",
      "F. Amiodarone"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has acute limb ischemia and requires immediate revascularization in arder to salvage the limb. Acute limb ischemia is defined as a sudden decrease in perfusion that threatens limb viability and presents within 2 weeks of symptom onset. Classically, patients present with some or all of the \"five P's\": pain, pulselessness, pallor, paresthesias, and paralysis. Acute limb ischemia may be due to embolism, thrombosis, ar trauma. Arterial emboli account for a large fraction of acute limb ischemic events, and 80% of embali start in the heart. In fact, up to 75% of patients with lower extremity emboli have atrial fibrillation ar a histary of recent myocardial infarction. Embaoli tend to lodge in areas of arterial narrowing such as at bifurcations. Given his history of atrial fibrillation, this patient's limb ischemia is likely secondary to an embolus lodged at an arterial bifurcation. Anticoagulation with warfarin could have prevented this episode.\n(Choices A & C) Aspirin and clopidogrel are less effective than warfarin in decreasing embolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n(Choices B, E & F) Metoprolol and diltiazem are used for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Unfortunately, rate control is not sufficient to decrease the embolic risk. Amiodarone can be used far both rate and rhythm control, but again would not prevent the embolic complications.\nEducational objective:\nAnticoagulation with warfarin is the most effective way to decrease the risk of embolic phenomena in patients with atrial fibrillation. Embaoli can cause stroke and limb ischemia."

He is currently wheelchair-bound secondary ta stroke-related left-sided hemiparesis. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg and his heart rate is 100/min. There is no jugular venous distention or hepatojugular reflux. His chest is clear to auscultation but his abdomen is enlarged with shifting dullness and a fluid wave, suggestive of ascites. His liver is palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin. His spleen is also palpable. On examination of his lower extremities, you note right-sided calf swelling and tenderness. Which af the following is the most likely cause af this patient's ascites?",
    "options": [
      "A. Right-sided heart failure",
      "B. Pulmonary embalism",
      "C. Protein C deficiency",

      "F. Nephrotic syndrome",
      "G. Chronic liver disease"
    ],
    "answer": "G",
    "explanation": "This patient's history of intravenous drug abuse puts him at increased risk for cirrhosis secondary to infection with hepatitis B or C. The findings of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and ascites aon physical examination paint toward this diagnosis. Indeed, the most common cause of ascites is hepatic cirrhosis. The patient's leg swelling may be due to deep venous thrombosis resulting from impaired mabhility.\n(Choice A & B) Right-sided heart failure can raise the portal venous pressure, but is less likely in this case due to the absence of jugular venous distention and hepatojugular reflux. Recurrent pulmonary embolism could also cause right heart failure and ascites.\n(Choice C) Protein C deficiency predisposes to venous thromboembolism. This condition can be inherited ar acquired in patients wha develop liver disease. Potentially, protein C deficiency could explain an incidental deep venous thrombosis in this patient as well as partal or hepatic vein thramboses, but these would be less likely causes of partal hypertension than chronic liver disease, especially in a former [V drug user.\n(Choice D) Atherosclerosis may have contributed to this patient's previous stroke but would not cause ascites unless congestive heart failure due to chronic ischemic heart disease was responsible. The fact that this patient's lungs are clear ta auscultation argues against left heart failure. He does not have signs of right heart failure.\n(Choice E) A paradoxical embolism, defined as the passage of an embolus fram the venaus circulation across a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect into the systemic circulation, could conceivably have caused this patient's past stroke but would not explain his current ascites.\n(Choice F) MNephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, edema, and hyperlipidemia) can cause ascites, but this condition alsa typically causes anasarca as well due ta severe hypoalbuminemia.\nEducational objective:\nFartal hypertension is the most common cause of ascites. Portal hypertension is usually due to cirrhosis fram chronic liver disease (alcoholic ar viral). Intravenous drug abuse predisposes ta cirrhosis by putting individuals at increased risk far chranic infection with hepatitis B or C."

      "A. Bounding pulses",
      "B. Fixed splitting of S2",
      "C. Pulsus paradoxus",
      "D. Pulsus parvus and tardus"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's auscultatory findings demonstrate an early diastolic murmur, which is characteristic of aortic regurgitation (AR). The murmur associated with AR varies considerably with the degree of regurgitation, with mild AR associated with only an early diastolic murmur and severe AR often resulting in a holodiastalic murmur. In addition to cardiac auscultation, other aspects of the physical examination are also very impartant in the diagnosis of AR. A commanly encountered physical finding is a bounding pulse or \"water hammer\" pulse. This results because AR Is associated with an increased stroke volume, which produces an abrupt rise in the systolic blood pressure and rapid distension of the peripheral arteries. Then during diastole, there is a regurgitation of blood back into the left ventricle, resulting in a low diastalic pressure and collapse of the peripheral arteries. This hyperdynamic pulse is also associated with several other named physical findings, which are by themselves nonspecific but may be helpful in the diagnosis of AR.\n(Choice B) Atrial septal defects produce fixed splitting of S2, and may also be associated with a midsystolic pulmonary flow murmur.\n(Choice C) Pulsus paradoxus refers to a fall in the systemic arterial pressure by mare than 10 mmHg during inspiration, and is often associated with cardiac tamponade.\n(Choice D) Fulsus parvus (i.e. decreased pulse amplitude) and pulsus tardus (i.e. delayed pulse upstroke) are associated with aortic stenosis as opposed to aortic regurgitation.\nEducational objective:\nAartic regurgitation produces an early diastolic murmur and can be associated with several physical signs caused by a hyperdynamic pulse, including bounding or \"water hammer\" peripheral pulses."

      "E. High-range proteinuria",
      "F. Polycystic kidney disease"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's EKG does nat reveal P waves, ST segment elevation ar depression, ar T wave inversion suggestive of ischemia. Instead, his EKG reveals atrial fibrillation. This most comman chronic arrhythmia typically presents asymptomatically but may present acutely with chest discomfart, palpitations, weakness, and shortness of breath. An EKG will reveal irregular, narrow QRS complexes with absent P waves. The ventricular rate may range significantly.\nThe causes of acute atrial fibrillation are myriad and may be divided into cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, and drug-related etiologies. Cardiac causes include hypertension, acute ischemia, heart failure, myopericardial inflammation, valve disease, and surgery. Pulmonary causes include any acute lung disease (e.g. pneumania), pulmonary embali, and hypoxia. Metabolic conditions, such as catecholamine surges or hyperthyroidism, also may cause atrial fibrillation. Drugs that can induce atrial fibrillation include alcohal, cocaine, amphetamines, and theophylline. Hyperthyroidism is the most commaon cause of acute atrial fibrillation listed amangst the answer choices.\n(Choice A) Cushing's syndrome is a condition characterized by chronically elevated levels of systemic corticosteroids. Typical changes include central obesity, diabetes mellitus, proximal muscle weakness, psychosis, thin skin, and osteoporosis. Atrial fibrillation is not a comman finding.\n(Choice C) A proximal aortic dissection could potentially cause atrial fibrillation by interfering with coranary blood flow and aortic valve function. However, the EKG is not concerning for ischemic changes and typical symptoms of an aortic dissection (tearing pain radiating ta the back, hypertension) are absent.\n(Choice D) High-frequency hearing loss is associated with aging and certain congenital long QT syndromes. Itis not strongly correlated with acute atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice E) High-range proteinuria, or nephratic syndrome, may be caused by a range of glamerular disorders. However, high-range proteinuria is not strongly associated with acute atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice F) Valve diseases associated with ADPKD predispose patients to atrial fibrillation; however, ADPKD-related valve disease is much less common than hyperthyroidism.\nEducational objective:\nAtrial fibrillation presents on EKG as an irregularly irregular, narrow QRS complex tachycardia that lacks P waves. The causes of acute atrial fibrillation are numerous and include cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, and drug-related etiologies."

The patient reports that he is afraid his heart attack is recurring. He localizes the pain to the middle of the chest, and says that he can only take shallow breaths because deep breaths make the pain warse. Leaning forward in his chair makes the pain somewhat better.

      "E. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The pattern of this patient's pain (worse with deep inspiration, improved on leaning forward) suggests pericarditis rather than myacardial infarction. Furthermare, the EKG findings described are classic for pericarditis (diffuse ST elevation with the exception of reciprocal depression in aVR), whereas only specific leads are affected in MI. Post-MI acute pericarditis typically occurs in the first several days after the infarction. This patient mast likely has Dressler's syndrome, a pericarditis that can occur weeks after an MI. Dressler's syndrome is believed ta be due to immunalogic phenomena. Malaise and sometimes fever are also characteristic. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is typically elevated. NSAIDs are the mainstay of therapy for Dressler's syndrome. Corticosteroids can be used in refractory cases or when NSAIDs are contraindicated.\n(Choice A) Anticoagulation with heparin would be appropriate if this patient was having another myocardial infarction, but the characteristics of his pain as well as the EKG findings are mare suggestive of pericarditis.\n(Choice B) Coumadin is used for long-term anticoagulation, and should probably be avoided in a patient with pericarditis to prevent the development of a hemarrhagic pericardial effusion.\n(Choice C) Mitroglycerine and beta-blockers are treatments for myocardial infarction, but are not helpful in the treatment of pericarditis.\n(Choice D) Broad-spectrum antibiotics are nat indicated for Dressler's syndrome since itis caused by an immunalagic abnarmality and not infection.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with Dressler's syndrome present weeks after a myocardial infarction with chest pain that is impraved by leaning forward. NSAIDs are the treatment of choice. Anticoagulation should be avoided to prevent development of a hemarrhagic pericardial effusion."

    "explanation": "This patient appears to have suffered an episode of rheumatic fever one year ago. Rheumatic fever results from untreated streptococcal pharyngitis and is more comman in developing nations due to a lack of access to antibiotics. Diagnosis of rheumatic fever is made by using the Jones criteria, which require evidence of a Group A Strep infection along with two major criteria or one major with two minor criteria. Major criteria include carditis, polyarthritis, chorea, rash (erythema marginatum), and subcutaneous nodules. Minor criteria include arthralgias, fever, elevated acute phase reactants, and prolonged PR interval.

The patient's mid-diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex is consistent with mitral stenosis, the most comman valvular complication of rheumatic fever.\nRepeated episodes of rheumatic fever can worsen valvular function. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with a prior episode of rheumatic fever be given antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin ta prevent a recurrence. The duration of treatment is not firmly established, but most physicians will treat until the patient reaches the age of 18.\n(Choice B) Patients with mitral stenosis may eventually go on to develop heart failure. B-blockers such as metoprolol can improve exercise tolerance in patients with NYHA Stage lll or IV heart failure. However, this patient appears to exercise regularly without symptoms of heart failure. Therefore B-blockers would not be beneficial.\n(Choice C) Medical treatment far mitral stenasis consists primarily of preload reduction with diuretics ar nitrates as opposed to afterload reduction with ACE-inhibitors.\n(Choice D) Digoxin can be used in patients with mitral stenosis if there is coexisting left ventricular dysfunction, which this patient does nat appear to have. It can also be used for rate contral if the patient develops atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice E) Patients with mitral stenosis are at increased risk far atrial fibrillation secondary to left atrial enlargement. This can result in cardioembaolic embali. However, this patient does not have atrial fibrillation; therefore anticoagulation with warfarin is not indicated.\nEducational objective:\nPatients who have had an episode of rheumatic fever should receive antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin ta prevent further attacks."

    "question": "A 48-year-old man presents to the emergency department with difficulty breathing and chest discomfart. His pain worsens with inspiration but does not radiate. He says that he has never had symptoms like this before. His past medical history is unremarkable. He works as a long-haul truck driver. Cn physical examination, his blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, his heart rate is 110/min, his respiratory rate is 31/min, and his temperature is 36.7° (98°F). ECG reveals sinus tachycardia but no ischemic ST-segment ar T-wave changes. His chest X-ray is shown below.\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascending aortic dissection",
      "B. Myocardial infarction",
      "C. Pneumotharax",
      "D. Pulmonary embalism",
      "E. Pleural effusion"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's histary (chest pain following long-distance driving) should raise strong concerns for pulmonary embolism (PE). His shartness of breath and the pleuritic quality of his pain further support this idea. His physical exam is consistent as well; the mast commaon physical exam findings in a patient with a PE are tachypnea and tachycardia. Fever, cough, and hemoptysis may also be present. Chest X-ray may reveal dilatation of the pulmonary artery proximal to the clot and collapse of the vessels distal to the clot (Westermark's sign). Pleural infiltrates corresponding to areas of pulmonary infarction (Hampton's hump), pleural effusions, and atelectasis may be seen as well. However, the most common finding an chest X-ray is a normal film, as in the patient described above. Laboratory studies reveal an elevated D-dimer.\n(Choice A) An ascending aortic dissection arises from an intimal tear that allows a false lumen to be created between the media and adventitia of the aorta. Patients present with severe chest pain that radiates to the back and neck. Hypertension is a major risk factar. The chest X-ray may reveal a widened mediastinum.\n(Choice B) Myocardial infarction must be considered high an the differential diagnosis in this patient with chest pain. However working against this diagnosis is the nan-exertional, pleuritic quality of his pain and the absence of ST-segment and T-wave changes on his ECG.\n(Choice C) Pneumathaorax is air in the pleural space. The classic chest x-ray finding is a radiolucency at the apex of the lung. A severe pneumothorax can cause esophageal and mediastinal deviation.\n(Choice E) Pleural effusions cause blunting af the costophrenic angles and are easily seen on lateral chest X-ray. A free-flowing effusion will layer on lateral decubitus X-ray.\nEducational Objective:\nPulmonary emboli cause dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia. While there are suggestive chest X-ray findings, the chest X-ray is normal in mast cases. The most common ECG finding is sinus tachycardia."

    "question": "A 60-year-old white man comes into the Emergency Room with intensive retrosternal pain that began ten minutes ago. He has never had such pain before. His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, type 2, controlled with diet. His blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg and HR is 80/min. You give him one chewable tablet of aspirin and two sublingual tablets of nitroglycerin with a 5-minute interval After the second tablet of nitroglycerin, the pain is greatly relieved. What is the most important mechanism responsible far pain relief in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increase in coranary blood flow",
      "B. Increased cardiac contractility",
      "C. Dilation of resistance vessels",
      "D. Dilation of capacitance vessels",
      "E. Change in the activity of baroreceptors"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The primary mechanism respansible for the effect of nitroglycerin in patients with anginal pain is dilation of veins (capacitance vessels). Increased venous capacitance and venous pooling of the blood lead to significant decrease in ventricular preload and decrease in heart size. As the result of these changes, oxygen requirement of the heart greatly reduces. Nitroglycerin also causes arterial dilation (Choice C) and, therefore, decreases ventricular afterload, but this effect has less significance in relieving anginal pain. It is unclear whether nitroglycerin significantly increases coronary blood flaw in patients with obstructive caranary heart disease (Choice A), although it does so in healthy subjects. Secondary effects provoked by nitroglycerin like increased heart contractility (Choice B) and reflex tachycardia are due to change in the activity of barareceptars (Choice E) in respanse to the decrease in blood pressure. These effects increase myocardial oxygen demand.\nEducational Objective:\nThe main mechanism responsible far pain relief in patients with anginal pain treated with nitroglycerin is dilation of veins and decrease in ventricular preload."

    "question": "A 34-year-old male who recently immigrated from Brazil presents with a 5 month history of exertional dyspnea without associated chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, or syncope. His past medical history is significant for an episode of megacolon, which was treated 2 years ago. On physical examination, there is 1+ pedal edema and mild jugular venous distention. Cardiac exam is significant for the presence af an S3, but no murmurs are heard. Chest x-ray reveals prominent cardiomegaly. Based on these findings, which of the following is most likely causing his symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Diphtheric myocarditis",
      "B. Coronary artery disease",
      "C. Protozoal disease",
      "D. Giant cell myacarditis",
      "E. Rickettsial myocarditis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has Chagas disease, a chranic protozoal disease caused by Trypanosama cruzi. The organism is common throughout Latin America, and should be considered in a symptomatic patient wha has recently immigrated from that area. The two primary manifestations of Chagas disease are megacalon/megaesophagus and cardiac disease. Megacolon or megaesophagus (focal Gl dilatation) occur secondary to destruction of the nerves controlling the Gl smooth muscle. This patient's pedal edema, jugular venous distention, S3, and cardiomegaly all paint toward congestive heart failure. The pathophysiology of Chagas heart disease is not well understood, but probably represents a prolonged myocarditis secondary to the protozoal infection.\n(Choice A) Diphtheria is unusual in present times because of widespread immunizations. Furthermore, diphtheria myocarditis is exceedingly rare. Upper respiratory tract symptoms would be expected.\n(Choice B) Coronary artery disease would be fairly unlikely in this young patient without risk factars far atherosclerosis.\n(Answer D) Giant cell myocarditis is a rare and frequently fatal form of myocarditis. The underlying pathophysiology is not well understood but likely involves autoimmunity. Patients with giant cell myocarditis tend to present with symptoms that are bath mare severe and mare acute than those affecting the patient described here.\n(Choice E) Rickettsial infection can cause myocarditis, but megacolon would not be expected.\nEducational objective:\nChagas disease is a chronic disease that can cause megaesophagus, megacolon, and/or cardiac dysfunction. The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, endemic to Latin America, is responsible."

    "question": "A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath. His blood pressure is 146/92 mmHg, respiratory rate is 26/min, and oxygen saturation is 87% on room air. Cardiac auscultation findings over the apex are given below. Based an the physical findings, which of the following is the best initial therapy for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Inhaled bronchodilators",
      "B. Intravenous beta-blockers",
      "C. Intravenous diltiazem",
      "D. Intravenous diuretics",
      "E. Pericardiocentesis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "In addition to hearing the narmal S1 and S2 on auscultation, there is an extra sound occurring after S2 known as the third heart sound (S3). The presence of this additional heart sound produces a rhythm that has been described as sounding like \"ken-tuc-KY\", with the third syllable corresponding to the S3. The S3 is believed to result when inflow from the left atrium strikes blood that is already in the left ventricle, causing reverberation of blood between the left ventricular walls. Although this extra sound can be normal in younger individuals and well-trained athletes, its appearance later in life is often a sign of left ventricular failure. This patient has several signs cansistent with left heart failure including shortness of breath, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. When combining these clinical findings with a S3, the most likely diagnosis is left ventricular failure, far which the most appropriate treatment at this time would be intravenous diuretics.\n(Choice A) Inhaled bronchodilators would be the appropriate treatment far patients suffering from an acute COPD ar asthma exacerbation. However, such patients would present with wheezing on chest auscultation.\n(Choice B) Although patients with heart failure will benefit from beta-blockers in the long term, they are not as effective as diuretics at providing symptomatic benefits in the shart term.\n(Choice C) Due to its negative inotropic effects, diltiazem is not beneficial in the treatment of patients with decompensated heart failure.\n(Choice E) A pericardiocentesis is indicated in some patients with a pericardial effusion, which is not associated with S3.\nEducational objective:\nThe third heart sound (S3) is a low frequency diastolic sound heard just after S2 that is associated with left ventricular failure. Intravenous diuretics provide symptomatic benefits to patients with decompensated heart failure."

    "question": "Neighbors find a 65-year-old male unconscious in his garden and immediately call EMS. The man is intubated at the scene. Inthe ER, he develops sustained ventricular tachycardia and requires cardioversion. He is started on an antiarrhythmic agent and, ance recovered, is discharged to home. Three manths later he returns to his physician complaining of dyspnea an exertion. Chest-x ray reveals bilateral lung fibrosis. All cultures are negative and lung biopsy reveals lipoid pneumonitis. Which of the following medications is most likely responsible for his current condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Procainamide",

      "H. Flecainide",
      "I. Ibutilide",
      "J. Sotalal"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The above patient had an episode of ventricular tachycardia and, after receiving treatment, developed lipoid pneumanitis. Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic known to cause lung damage. Recall the 5 comman side effects of amiodarone:\na Pulmanary toxicity: Amiodarone lung toxicity is associated with total cumulative dose rather than serum drug levels. The longer the patient uses amiodarone, the greater the chance of pulmonary fibrosis developing. It is an excellent drug for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, but its multiple side effects limit long-term use.\n= Thyroid dysfunction: Hypathyroidism is more commonly seen (85%), but hyperthyroidism can occur as well (15%). Since thyroid dysfunction is so comman with amiodarone, patients should have TSH levels checked before starting treatment, and also at 3-4 manth intervals thereafter.\n= Hepatotoxicity: Up to 25% experience transient elevations of aminotransferase levels. This is usually asymptomatic, though the drug should be stopped if elevations greater than 2-fold are seen.\n= Corneal deposits: Corneal deposits are a commaon side effect, as amiodarone is secreted by the lacrimal gland. Vision is usually not affected. Development of corneal deposits does not necessitate drug discontinuation.\n= Skin changes: Some patients develop a blue-gray skin discoloration, typically most prominent on the face.\n(Choice A) Procainamide is used to treat atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Potential side effects include nausea, drug-induced lupus, agranulocytosis, and QT prolongation.\n(Choice C) Lidocaine is a class IB anti-arrhythmic agent used to treat ventricular arrhythmias. High doses can cause confusion, seizures and respiratory depression, but it does not cause lung fibrosis.\n(Choice D) Quinidine Is a class IA anti-arrhythmic agent used to treat atrial arrhythmias. It does have a few well-known side effects including diarrhea, tinnitus, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, hemalytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, but it does not cause lung fibrosis.\n(Choice E) Digoxin is an inatrope used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias. It can cause nausea, anorexia, AY block, and ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. It does not affect the lung.\nEducational objective:\nAmiodarone is a class lll antiarrhythmic agent, well known for causing pulmonary fibrosis. Thyroid dysfunction (hypo and hyper), hepatotoxicity, corneal deposits and skin discoloration are other potential side effects."

    "question": "A 12-year-old African American male is found to have a murmur during a routine sparts physical. He has a family history of sudden death at a young age. tis a harsh crescendo-decrescendo murmur that begins after S1 and is best heard at the left lower sternal border. Valsalva maneuver intensifies the murmur. Which of the following is the most likely mitral valve abnormality in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Dilated mitral valve annulus",
      "B. Rupture of chordae tendinae",
      "C. Abnormal mitral leaflet motion",
      "D. Mitral annulus calcifications",
      "E. Prolapse af the mitral valve"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the left lower sternal boarder in a young individual is mast likely due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The disease is more common in African-Americans. The murmur classically increases during Valsalva maneuver due to decreased preload and decreased filling of the left ventricle. This is in cantrast to most other cardiac murmurs which decrease in intensity with decreased preload. The autflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is due ta bath a hypertrophied interventricular septum and an abnormality in the motion of the mitral valve leaflets referred to as systolic anterior motion (SAM). SAM results in increased outflow obstruction, and in some patients may be of greater clinical consequence than septal hypertrophy.\n(Choice A) Dilation of the mitral valve annulus can occur with dilated cardiomyopathy ar ischemic cardiomyopathy and leads to mitral regurgitation. This murmur is typically heard as a holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla.\n(Choice B) Rupture of the chordae tendinea can occur secondary to mitral valve prolapse, endocarditis, trauma, or myocardial infarction. The result is mitral regurgitation.\n(Choice D) Mitral annulus calcification is most common in patients over age 40. It may result in mitral regurgitation.\n(Choice E) Prolapse of the mitral valve can occur due ta myxomatous degeneration of the valve and chardae tendinae. tis typically heard as a midsystolic click at the apex.\nEducational objective:\nQutflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results from both septal hypertrophy and systolic anteriar motion (SAM) of the mitral valve."

She also reports shortness of breath, palpitations and diapharesis. The pain is retrosternal and radiates to the left arm. There are no aggravating or relieving factors. On review of systems, the patient reports having had a runny nose, sare throat and dry cough for the past 3 days. Her past medical histary is significant for panic attacks, for which she takes paroxetine, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding, for which she takes estrogen. Her family history is significant for the sudden death of her father at age 44 from a heart attack. Social history reveals that she has smoked ane pack of cigarettes per day far the past 15 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lorazepam",
      "B. Heparin",
      "C. Aspirin",
      "D. Ibuprofen",
      "E. Acetaminophen",
      "F. Oxycodone"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This vignette describes a 36-year-old waman with a history of panic attacks wha presents with sudden-onset chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Despite her psychiatric history and relatively young age, a thorough evaluation for an acute caronary event is necessary because she has multiple cardiac risk factors. First, she has a pasitive family history far acute coronary syndrome at a young age. Additionally, she has a longstanding personal histary of smoking and is taking estrogen therapy, factors which together dramatically increase her risk of thrombosis. This risk is increased further given that she is >= 35 years of age.\nMyocardial infarction is probable in this patient. thus aspirin should be administered as soon as possible. Aspirin therapy has been shown to greatly decrease the martality associated with acute coronary events. Even if this episode turns aut not to have been an acute caronary event, one aspirin would not be detrimental.\n(Choice B) Pulmonary embolism is possible, especially in light of this patient's risk factors for thrombosis (smoking, estrogen treatment, age). However, her clinical presentation is somewhat atypical, thus further work-up Is required before heparin can be administered.\nEducational objective:\nChest pain in a young persan with cardiovascular risk factors warrants a thorough cardiac work-up. Aspirin should be the first drug administered when suspicion of a coronary artery event is high due to its ahility to prevent platelet aggregation."

    "question": "A 65-year-old female is admitted to the hospital with increasing shortness of breath, weight gain and lower extremity edema. She has a history of hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, and hyperlipidemia. Her home medications include oral aspirin, digoxin, furosemide, metoprolal, lisinopril and atorvastatin. She is started on intravenous furosemide. On day three of hospitalization telemetry reveals six beats of wide complex ventricular tachycardia. Physical examination now shows decreased leg edema and clear lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's tachycardia?",
    "options": [
      "A. Add spironolactone",
      "B. Add metolazone",
      "C. Measure serum electrolytes",
      "D. Discontinue atorvastatin",
      "E. Discontinue metoprolal"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "When a patient experiences recurrent VT (ventricular tachycardia), the first thing to do after stabilizing the patient is to search far an underlying cause. This patient most likely has an electralyte imbalance due ta diuretics. Furosemide commonly causes hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. If uncorrected, bath hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can lead to ventricular tachycardia. Furthermore, hypokalemia potentiates side effects of digoxin, which include arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia. Therefore, ardering serum electrolytes and serum digoxin level is the most reasonable initial approach.\n(Choice A) Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretic, and has proven martality benefits in patients with severe CHF It would be of benefit in the long-term management of this patient, and could balance out the potassium wasting caused by furosemide. However, immediate identification and reversal of the underlying cause of this patient's VT is the priority.\n(Choice B) Metolazone is a thiazide diuretic. Adding anather diuretic is unnecessary because the patient's fluid overload has resolved. In addition, metolazone could further worsen her electrolyte imbalances and increase her risk of developing recurrent ventricular tachycardia.\n(Choice D) Stopping the patient's atorvastatin is unnecessary because it does not cause ventricular arrhythmias and the patient needs it to treat her hyperlipidemia.\n(Choice E) Beta-blackers should be avoided in acute decompensated heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. However, the patient's congestive symptoms have now improved sa halding the metoprolol is currently unnecessary. Metoprolol does not cause ventricular arrhythmias.\nEducational objective:\nLoop diuretics cause hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. These electrolyte abnormalities can cause ventricular tachycardia, and also potentiate the side effects of digoxin."

      "C. Lidocaine",
      "D. Pracainamide",
      "E. Adenosine"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The key to managing this patient is his history of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. In WPW, an accessary pathway conducts depolarization directly from the atria to the ventricles without traversing the AV node. In general, patients with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular rate are treated with AV nodal blockers like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and adenosine. However, in WPW, drugs that increase refractoriness of the AV node only serve to increase conduction across the accessory pathway, which can lead to degeneration into ventricular fibrillation. Thus, the best treatment far a patient with WPW and atrial fibrillation is conversion back to sinus rhythm, either through electrical cardioversion or with antiarrhythmic medications like pracainamide.\n(Choices A, B and E) Digoxin, verapamil, and adenosine increase AY node refractoriness and are thus contraindicated in patients with WPW because they favor conduction across the accessory pathway.\n(Choice C) Lidocaine is used for ventricular arrhythmias.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with Waolf-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate should be treated with cardioversion or antiarrhythmics like procainamide. AY nodal blockers like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and adenosine should be avoided because they can cause increased conductance through the accessory pathway."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "First-degree heart block is characterized by a prolonged constant PR interval (>=0.2s). The heart block may be entirely normal or may be secondary to increased vagal tane ar use of digitalis. The AY conduction must be narmal and intact. When first-degree heart block is identified, na treatment is required. The majarity of patients are asymptomatic and remain so. Almost all cases of first-degree heart black are discovered as an incidental finding while working up the patient far a different disorder.\nOption A: First-degree heart block requires no treatment. The heart rate is not affected and neither bradycardia nar any form of AY block is seen. Atropine, which is an antichalinergic agent, is never used to treat first-degree heart block. Atropine increases heart rate.\nOption B: Beta-blockers have no role in the treatment of heart block of any form. Beta-blockers can precipitate and warsen heart block. First-degree heart block does not affect the heart rate or the farce of contraction. Beta-blockers are generally used as anti-hypertensives, anti anginals and anti arrhythmics.\nOption C: Pacemakers are never inserted far first-degree heart block. Pacemakers are more suitable for bradycardia or trifascicular blocks.\nOption D: When an individual is diagnosed with a first-degree heart black, no further studies are required. The disarder is benign and does not progress to heart block of any form. If the patient has been on digoxin, digoxin levels may be ordered ar the drug with held for a few days. Electrophysialogical studies are generally done when the site and focus of arrhythmias is required for ablation or resection. EF studies are almost never dane for first-degree heart block, as there is no pathology ever identified.\nOption E: Catheterization is an invasive procedure and certainly not indicated for this benign arhythmia.\nOption F: Atropine is used for symptomatic bradycardia resulting fram type Il and type lll heart block, not far type I block.\nEducational objective:\nFirst-degree heart block is a completely benign arrhythmia and requires no treatment."

      "F. IV fluid resuscitation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient is presenting with a hemodynamically significant supraventricular tachycardia and requires emergent DC cardioversion. In mast patients with supraventricular tachycardia (i.e. tachycardia presenting with a narrow CRS complex), medications or maneuvers to increase vagal tone are sufficient to break the arrhythmia and restore sinus rhythm. However, when a patient has unstable vitals signs ar refractory chest pain, the Adult Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) algarithm recommends DC cardioversion. This patient's blood pressure is dangerously low and he should undergo emergent DC cardioversion.\n(Choice A) Adenosine decreases conduction through the AY node and is the first-line pharmacologic agent for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, though patients should try vagal maneuvers before medications are attempted. Neither medications nor vagal maneuvers are appropriate when there is hemodynamic instability, however.\n(Choice B) Frocainamide is a class la anti-arrhythmic that may be used to treat supraventricular tachycardia when AY nodal blockers and/or DC cardioversion have failed or are contraindicated.\n(Choice C) Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that slows AV node conduction. It may be used to terminate supraventricular tachycardias in cases where vagal maneuvers and adenosine administration have failed.\n(Choice D) Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that slows AY node conduction. It may be used to terminate supraventricular tachycardias in cases where vagal maneuvers and adenosine have failed.\n(Choice F) Hypovolemia is a potential precipitant of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. There is little historical information here to suggest hypovolemia: this patient's hypotension mare likely reflects his SVT than volume depletion.\nEducational objective:\nHemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia should be treated with vagal maneuvers followed by adenosine and AV nodal blockers. Unstable patients with supraventricular tachycardia should undergo DC cardioversion."

    "explanation": "This patient is presenting with uremic pericarditis. Uremic pericarditis is seen in 6-10% of patients with chranic renal failure. Uremic pericarditis is an absolute indication of initiation of dialysis, or for intensification of dialysis for those already an dialysis. Pericardial fluid in uremic pericarditis is most often hemarrhagic. The clinical features of uremic pericarditis are similar to other pericarditis; however; it is most commonly associated with BUN >= 60 mg/dL and anemia. Most of the patients with uremic pericarditis respond rapidly to dialysis with resolution of chest pain, as well as a decrease in the size of the pericardial effusion.\nIndication and contraindication of renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in end stage renal disease are as follows:\nAbsolute indications:\n1. Fluid overload not respansive to medical treatment.\n2. Hyperkalemia not responsive to medical management.\n3. Uremic pericarditis.\n4. Refractory metabolic acidosis.\nRelative indications:\n1. Glomerular filtration rate < 10 ml/min (<= 15 ml/min in diabetics).\n2. Serum creatinine >= 8 mg/dL (>= 6 mg/dL in diabetics).\nJ. Severe uremic symptoms (Uremic seizure and coma is an indication of immediate dialysis).\nCaontraindications:\n1. Debilitating chronic disease.\n2. Severe irreversible dementia.\nNote: Indication of renal replacement therapy is not strictly based on serum creatinine or BUN levels.\n(Choice A and B) NSAIDs (sometimes corticosteroids) are the first line of therapy for most cases af pericarditis, but nat with uremic pericarditis. They may be used in patients with uremic pericarditis who do not respond to dialysis; however, they have low success rates.\n(Choice C) Pericardiocentesis is indicated in cases of pericardial tamponade; however, this patient has no symptoms or signs suggestive of tampanade (hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds).\nEducational Objective:\nUremic pericarditis is an absolute indication for initiation of dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure. Know the indications and contraindications of dialysis in uremic patients. Remember that the decision to start dialysis is not strictly based on serum creatinine ar BUN levels."

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman with a long history of hypertension faints after experiencing the sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiates to her back. She is rushed to the emergency room. Upan arrival she is agitated and demands quick pain relief. Her heart rate is 110/min and blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg. Jugular veins are distended. An intraartenal catheter shows significant variation of systolic blood pressure related to the respiratory cycle. Chest x-ray reveals widening of the mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's syncope?",
    "options": [
      "A. Papillary muscle dysfunction",
      "B. Intravascular volume loss",
      "C. Pencardial fluid accumulation",
      "D. Vagal hyperactivity",
      "E. Cardiac tachyarrhythmia",
      "F. Aortic stenosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient suffered an aortic dissection complicated by cardiac tamponade, which led to syncope. Aortic dissection typically occurs in patients with hypertension and presents as severe chest pain radiating to the back. Chest x-ray may reveal a widened mediastinum.\nOne complication of aortic dissection is rupture into the pericardial sac, leading to cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade occurs when enough blood accumulates in the pericardial space that the pressure exerted on the heart chambers begins to limit diastalic filling. The result is decreased preload and decreased cardiac output. Syncope may result from decreased cranial blood flood. Tamponade presents as hypotension, evidence of right heart failure (distended jugular veins), and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus, or a disappearance of distal pulses on inspiration, may be present.\n(Choice A) Papillary muscle dysfunction is a well-described complication of acute myocardial infarction in which a papillary muscle is no longer able to hold the corresponding valve leaflet in place. It presents as acute mitral regurgitation with a holosystolic murmur and left-sided heart failure. Papillary muscle dysfunction is not a consequence of aortic dissection.\n(Choice B) Intravascular volume loss typically occurs from bleeding, poar oral intake, vomiting, or diarrhea. Patients may present in shock with or without an obvious source of bleeding. More commanly, however, patients present with orthostatic hypotension and syncope.\n(Choice D) Vagal hyperactivity is the mechanism behind vasovagal syncope. This disorder is characterized by nausea, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and pallor prior ta syncope.\n(Choice E) Cardiac tachyarrhythmias, both atrial (e.g, atrial fibrillation or flutter) and ventricular (e.g, ventricular tachycardia), may cause syncope. However, they typically present without warning, not preceded by chest pain. They also do not cause pulsus paradoxus or a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray.\n(Choice F) Aortic stenosis can cause syncope but is nat likely to be the cause in this case for several reasons. In aortic stenosis, syncape usually occurs with activity. Patients frequently have a preceding history of exertional symptoms (dyspnea, chest pain, andfor fatigue). The chest pain seen with aartic stenosis is not as severe as with aortic dissection and the pain does not typically radiate to the back. Also, aortic stenosis does not cause pulsus paradoxus or a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray.\nEducational Objective:\nCardiac tamponade is one of the mast deadly consequences of aortic dissection. ltis characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, and heart failure."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has a Marfanoid habitus and has suffered an aortic dissection. Defects in fibrillin are responsible far the abnormalities that arise in patients with Marfan's syndrome. Clinical findings often include: ligamentous laxity of joints, long thin digits and limbs, blood vessel fragility, spontaneous pneumathorax, pectus excavatum, mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, and retinal detachment. Marfan's syndrome and poorly controlled hypertension are significant risk factors for aortic dissection. Aortic dissection presents with severe chest pain that radiates to the back and neck. Chest X-ray may reveal a widened mediastinum. A comman physical exam finding is an early diastolic murmur as the dissection causes aortic regurgitation.\n(Choice A) An audible fourth heart sound (S4) may be heard in normal, young patients and in people with left ventricular hypertrophy. A fourth heart sound is not associated with Marfan's syndrome or aortic dissection.\n(Choice C) An opening snap is heard in patients with mitral stenosis. Significant mitral stenosis can cause left atrial enlargement, pulmanary hypertension and eventually right ventricular failure. Mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, not stenosis, are associated with Marfan's syndrome.\n(Choice D) Fixed splitting of the second heart sound (S2) is associated with atrial septal defects.\n(Choice E) Kussmaul's sign is an increase in jugular venous pressure that occurs in response to deep inspiration. It occurs in situations that cause right ventricular failure like constrictive pericarditis and right ventricular infarction. Kussmaul's sign is nat found in aortic dissection.\n(Choice F) Pulsus parvus et tardus refers to a carotid pulse that is slow (parvus) and late (tardus). tis classically observed in aortic stenosis, not aortic regurgitation or aortic dissection.\nEducational objective:\nAortic dissection is the most dangerous complication of Marfan's syndrome. It typically presents as tearing chest pain that radiates to the back and neck, and it must be identified immediately to decrease the risk of death. One common exam finding is an early diastolic murmur as the dissection causes aortic regurgitation."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with hypertension and a benign essential tremor. An essential tremor is characterized by a postural tremor (not a resting tremor unlike Parkinson's disease) and usually disturbs the performance of fine matar tasks. Sometimes, it runs in families with autosomal-dominant inheritance. The pathophysiologic basis of this condition is unclear. The inhibition of the tremor by a small amount of alcohal is typical. Propranalol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is effective in reducing the tremor probably by blocking beta-2 receptors. Therefare, administering prapranaolal ta this patient wauld help ta cantral bath the hypertension and the essential tremaor.\nOther anti-hypertensive medications, like thiazide diuretics (Choice D), calcium antagonists (Choices B and C), and ACE inhibitors (Choice E), do nat affect a benign essential tremor.\nEducational Objective:\nPropranolol is the drug of choice in patients who present with hypertension and a benign essential tremar."

      "E. Asystole"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The most common cause of death in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) is complex ventricular arrhythmia. Acute ischemia creates heterogeneity of conduction in the myocardium. Areas of partial block of conduction are frequently formed that predispose the patient to reentrant arrhythmia. Ventricular fibrillation is a typical example of reentrant arrhythmia. Decline in mortality of patients hospitalized with acute caronary syndromes is largely attributable ta the effective detection and treatment of reentrant ventricular arrhythmias.\nFull conduction black (Choice C) may occur in patients with acute myacardial infarction, especially inferiar wall MI, but it is a less comman cause af death.\nAsystole (Choice E) usually occurs in patients with severe complications of Ml (e.g. heart failure).\nElectramechanical dissociation (Choice A) is typical for pulmanary thromboembolism and pericardial tamponade.\nIncreased automaticity (Choice D) is a frequent cause of arrhythmia in patients with glycoside intoxication.\nEducational Objective:\nReentrant ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation) is the mast common cause of death in patients with acute myocardial infarction."

    "question": "A 60-year-ald Caucasian man presents to the office with a 2-week history of worsening shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. His breathlessness is worse at night. He thinks his legs are swelling up. He has hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He used to drink heavily and smoke 1 pack of cigarettes daily but has quit recently, although he still reports occasionally drinking a \"few beers.\" He currently denies any chest pain, palpitations or cough. His temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 96/min and respirations are 22/min. The pertinent physical findings are an S3, bibasilar crackles, JVP 10 cm above the sternal angle, mild hepatomegaly, and 4+ pitting lower extremity edema. The patient is immediately treated with oxygen, intravenous furosemide, and nitrates. Which af the following markers is mast likely elevated in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ejection fraction",
      "B. Mean carpuscular volume",
      "C. B-type natriuretic peptide",
      "D. Urine sodium",
      "E. Neutrophil count"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sometimes, it may be difficult to identify the cause of worsening dyspnea in elderly patients, especially if there exists a history of both congestive heart failure (CHF) and chranic obstructive pulmanary disease (COPD). In this case, CHF is the mast likely culprit due ta the following features: arthopnea (breathlessness worse while lying flat), lower extremity edema, S3, bibasilar crackles, jugular venous distention, and hepatomegaly. Therefore, the marker that is mast likely elevated in this case is B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP).\nBNP is a natriuretic harmane similar to ANP; however, in contrast to ANP which is released from the atria, BNP is released from the cardiac ventricles in response to volume overload. For this reason, measurement of plasma BNF has recently become a useful laboratory test to distinguish between CHF and ather causes of dyspnea. Studies have shown that a value >=100 pg/mL diagnosed CHF with a sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of 90, 76, and 83 percent, respectively.\n(Choice A) In cases of CHF secondary to coronary artery disease you would expect a reduced ejection fraction indicating systolic dysfunction.\n(Choice B) MCV could be slightly elevated due the patient's history of alcohol use; however, since the question is asking far the most likely elevated marker in the setting of acute heart failure, B-type natriuretic peptide is the best response.\n(Choice D) In a patient with CHF, sodium is reabsorbed via the kidneys in response ta a simulated renin-angiatensin-aldosterane system; therefore, this patient's urine sodium levels are mast likely low.\n(Choice E) Current studies are suggesting that an increased absalute neutrophil count (ANC) in patients with acute myocardial infarction may be used to predict the onset of subsequent acute congestive heart failure; however, there are no current approved recommendations regarding this matter.\nEducational Objective:\nThe measurement of serum BMP can help distinguish between CHF and other causes of dyspnea. A value >=100 pg/mL diagnoses CHF with a sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of 90, 76, and 83 percent, respectively."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical picture is most consistent with aortic dissection. The chest pain of aortic dissection is aften described as sudden, severe, tearing in quality, and radiating to the back. The patient's severe hypertension is a strang risk factor. That his symptoms now include leg weakness suggests that the dissection has progressed to include the descending aorta, possibly with ischemia of the arteries feeding the spinal cord. Chest xray often, though not always, shows mediastinal widening. Pleural effusion is another nonspecific radiographic finding. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a contrast chest CT aor transesophageal echocardiogram.\n(Choice A) Angina pectaris can present with chest pain, but it would nat last for 6 hours and should improve with rest.\n(Choice B) Myocardial infarction can cause prolonged chest pain, but the location of the pain and associated unilateral leg weakness would be unusual.\n(Choice C) Acute pericarditis causes chest pain that is positional in nature (worse while supine, improved an sitting up).\n(Choice E) Pulmonary embolism is possible given the patient's history of DVT and presence of pleural effusion on chest x-ray. However, the overall clinical presenation is not consistent with pulmonary embolism.\n(Choice F) Mediastinal tumors rarely present with acute onset chest pain. Furthermare, no mass was seen an chest x-ray.\n(Choice G) Fleuritis can cause chest pain and pleural effusion, but the pain is typically worse with inspiration.\n(Choice H) Pancreatitis causes epigastric pain that can radiate to the back, and may cause pleural effusions as well. The patient's alcohol intake does put him at risk for pancreatitis. However, pancreatitis would not explain the accompanying leg weakness.\n(Choice I) While it is possible for atherosclerotic emboli to break off and block the arteries that supply the leg, acute artenal blockade should produce leg pain or numbness along with weakness.\n(Choice J) This patient does have a history of peptic ulcers, making perforation a possibility; however free air under the diaphragm wauld be expected an chest x-ray.\nEducational objective:\nAortic dissection presents as sudden, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back. Mediastinal widening is often, though nat always, seen on chest x-ray. Leg weakness can occur if the dissection progresses to involve the arteries feeding the spinal cord."

He was punched in the face during a street fight two weeks ago. On admission he receives empiric intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin. Three days later, three out af four blood cultures grow Streptococcus vindans highly sensitive to penicillin. Which of the following is the best next step in managing this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Continue current regimen",
      "B. Switch antibiotics to IV ceftriaxone",
      "C. Switch antibiotics to IV aminoglycosides",
      "D. Switch antibiotics to oral penicillin VV",
      "E. Switch antibiotics to aral amoxicillin/clavulanate"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This vignette most likely describes a case of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), caused by transient bacteremia following the facial injury that seeded the patient's mitral valve. Abnormal valves predispose to endocarditis because turbulent flow denudes the valve endocardium, inviting bacterial colonization. Infection af native heart valves is most commonly caused by Streptococcus viridans. SBE typically presents with progressive fatigue and a chronic waxing and waning low-grade fever.\nThe patient was appropriately given empiric, broad spectrum antibacterial coverage upon admission. Mow that culture data and sensitivities have been obtained, the antibiotic coverage should be narrowed. Strepiococcus viridans highly susceptible ta penicillin (MIC <= 0.1mcg/ml) is best treated with IV penicillin G or IV ceftriaxone, a third generation cephalasparin. This is based on American Heart Assaciation recommendations. Unlike penicillin G, ceftriaxone is administered only once daily.\n(Choice C) IV aminoglycosides are NOT used as manatherapy in patients with endocarditis!\n(Choices D & E) Oral antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of endocarditis.\nEducational objective:\nOnce the specific causative bacterium responsible for native valve bacterial endocarditis is identified, the antibiotic coverage can be narrowed from empiric ta specific. Native valve bacterial endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans highly susceptible to penicillin is well-treated with IV penicillin G or IV ceftriaxane."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The mast probable diagnasis in this patient is Jervell-Lange-Nielsan syndrome. It is ane of the congenital 'QT' prolongation syndromes caused by molecular defects in ion channels. Jervell-Lange-MNielson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by congenital deafness and QT interval prolongation on EKG. QT interval prolongation predisposes patients with this syndrome to a particular type of ventricular tachycardia called torsades de pointes. Tarsades de pointes cause syncopal episodes and sudden death. The clues ta the correct diagnosis in this patient are a syncopal episode without following disorientation (post-episade confusion is mare characteristic for a seizure), hearing impairment and family histary.\nThe mast commanly used treatment modality for these patients is a beta-blocker like propranolol. If the patient is asymptomatic ar does not have a clearly documented syncope, beta blocker alone is sufficient. If the patient is symptomatic or has a documented episode of syncope, the treatment will be beta-blocker plus a DDD pacemaker.\nYerapamil (Choice B) is a Ca-channel blocker; it is not effective in patients with Jervell-Lange-Nielson syndrome.\nCluinidine (Choice C) is an anti-arrhythmic agent that prolongs QT interval, therefore it is contraindicated in this case.\nEthosuximide (Choice D) and phenobarbital (Choice E) are medications used to treat seizures.\nEducational objective:\nSyncaopal episode without following disorientation (post-episode confusion is mare characteristic for a seizure), hearing impairment, normal physical exam, and family history of sudden cardiac death should make you think of congenital lang \"QT\" syndrome.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient mast likely has subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), a diagnasis suggested by his fever, malaise, new systolic murmur, and painful skin lesions (Osler nodes). A valvular abnormality secondary to his childhood rheumatic fever would predispose to endocarditis. The mast common causes of subacute bacterial endocarditis are Viridans group streptococci, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staph (such as Staphylococcus epidermidis). Staph aureus is also a common cause of endocarditis, but the usual presentation is an acute, severe illness in a patient with normal heart valves.\nThis patient's recent cystoscopy likely precipitated a bacteremia that subsequently caused SBE. In general, the risk of bacteremia with genitourinary procedures is low, but can be greater in patients with preexisting urinary infections. Given that the apparent source of his bacteremia is his urinary tract, enterococci are far mare likely than viridans streptococci (usually upper respiratory) or coagulase negative staphylococci (usually from the skin).\n(Choice A) Streptococcus pyogenes causes strep throat.

      "F. Neck bruit"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Several cardiac and respiratory disorders can manifest with dyspnea. Given his elevated pro-brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP) level, this patient most likely has dyspnea secondary to congestive heart failure.\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted in response to ventricular stretch and wall tension when cardiac filling pressures are elevated. Specifically, cardiac myocytes secrete the BNP precursor, proBNF, which is then cleaved into biologically active c-terminal BMF and inactive n-terminal proBNF. It is common practice in the emergency department to measure the BNF level to differentiate dyspnea of heart failure from dyspnea of non-cardiac etiology. The level of circulating BMF correlates both with the severity of left ventricular filling pressure elevation as well as with martality. A low BMP level argues against acute heart failure with a very high negative predictive value.\nS3, the third heart sound, is a soft diastolic sound produced by tensing of the papillary chordal apparatus when there is rapid influx of blood into the ventricle in early diastole (about 0.15 secands following S2). S3 is alsa associated with elevated ventricular filling pressures.\n(Choice A) In general, wheezing is a sign of respiratary illness. Occasionally, however, patients with heart failure can develop expiratory wheezes due to bronchial wall edema.\n(Choice B) Cyanaosis can occur in many lung conditions that are not associated with heart failure.\n(Choice D) Peripheral edema can be a sign of heart failure, but there are several other non-cardiac causes that can alsa be responsible, including inferior vena cava obstruction, cirrhosis, etc.\n(Choice E) Renal artery stenosis produces periumbilical bruits.\n(Choice F) Carotid artery stenosis produces neck bruits.\nEducational objective:\nElevated BNF levels and an audible S3 are bath signs of increased cardiac filling pressures."

      "D. Increasing the dose of digitalis may be indicated",
      "E. Increasing sodium intake is needed to correct the electrolyte abnormality"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described reflects the importance of recognizing electrolyte abnormalities in patients with heart failure. The presence of hyponatremia indicates that the heart failure is severe. Water retention and the associated reduction in the plasma sodium concentration parallel the severity of the heart disease; they reflect the degree of neurchumaral activation in patients with heart failure. Low serum sodium level is associated with high levels of renin, aldosterone, vasopressin, and norepinephrine (Choice A). As a result a patient's survival is significantly reduced if the serum sodium level is below 137 mg/dL. Decreasing the intake af water, not increasing sodium intake (Choice E) can help to control the electrolyte abnormalities.\nHyperkalemia present in this patient may be due to the combination of enalapril, digoxin, and spironolactone (Choice B) Furosemide causes hypokalemia.\nIncreasing the dose af digoxin in this patient may be dangerous because of decreased renal function; he needs more diuretics.\nEducational Objective:\nHyponatremia is a bad prognostic factar in patients with heart failure. It indicates the presence of severe heart failure and a high level of neurahumaoral activation. Other important electrolyte abnarmalities in patients with heart failure include hypo- and hyperkalemia that may reflect the activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterane system or may be due to different drugs and drug combinations."

His past medical histary is significant far hypertension far which he takes hydrochloraothiazide and type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metfarmin. He had a medical check-up five manths aga which did not uncover any new abnormalities or medical issues. On physical examination today, his blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and his heart rate is 110 and irregularly irregular. His lab values are:\nHematocrit           41%\nWBC count          4,700/mm3\nPlatelets              200,000/mm3\nSodium               137 mEq/L\nPotassium         4.1 mEgiL\nCreatinine            0.8 maddL\nFasting glucose      285 mgidL\nWhich of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",

      "B. Salmeteral",
      "C. Amlodipine",
      "D. Aminophylline",
      "E. Spironolactone",
      "F. Warfarin",
      "G. Fluoxetine"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic arrhythmia, affecting nearly 10% of people over age 80. It is characterized by a ventricular rhythm that is irregular and often rapid, as well as indistinguishable atrial contractions. AF itself is rarely dangerous, but there can be serious complications. In particular, AF is often associated with blood stasis in the atria, which can promate atrial thrombus formation. These thrombi can embolize to the brain and cause strokes. Overall, AF increases the risk of stoke to 5 events per 100 patient-life years, though the risk is higher in older patients and those with a history of stroke, heart failure, valvular disease, diabetes, or hypertension.\nThere are two approaches to decreasing the risk of stroke in patients with AF. The first is rhythm contral via chemical ar electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. The ather strategy is anticoagulation with warfarin coupled with rate control using AY nodal blocking agents. Twa large randomized control trials revealed that these two strategies are statistically equivalent in terms af stroke prevention, with perhaps a slightly better outcome far rate control plus anticoagulation. Thus, the best approach to this patient in atrial fibrillation is warfarin therapy plus a rate-controlling agent like diltiazem, metoprolol, ar digoxin.\n(Choice A) Captopril will treat this patient's hypertension but will nat treat his atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice B) Salmeteral is a long-acting B2-adrenergic agonist that could actually warsen this patient's tachycardia.\n(Choice C) Amlodipine can effectively contral hypertension but not atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice D) Aminophylline has no role in treating atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice E) Spironolactone is most beneficial in treating patients with ascites from cirrhosis and those with Mew ark Heart Association class ll and IV heart failure. It will not improve this patient's atrial fibrillation.\n(Choice G) Fluoxetine is effective in treating major depressive disorder but will not benefit this patient's atrial fibrillation.\nEducational objective:\nAtrial fibrillation is the most common chronic arrhythmia in adults. It is characterized by an irregular heart rhythm and an oftentimes rapid rate. Rhythm control ar rate control plus anticoagulation may be used ta decrease the risk of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation."

    "question": "A 48-year-old African American man presents to the emergency room with severe retrosternal chest pain. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), blood pressure is 190/100 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 16/min. On physical examination, his lungs are clear to auscultation and his heart sounds are normal. EKG shows evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. A CT image af his chest is shawn below.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate immediate pharmacotherapy for this patient?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Labetalal",
      "B. Nifedipine",
      "C. Heparin",
      "D. Hydrochlorothiazide",
      "E. Hydralazine",
      "F. Streptokinase"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This man's retrosternal chest pain and elevated blood pressure should raise concern for cardiac or aortic pathology. The absence of ST changes on EKG puts aortic dissection high on the differential diagnosis. Hypertension is the leading risk factor for aortic dissection, and this patient's left ventricular hypertrophy suggests that his present hypertension is chronic. Chest CT is a sensitive study for diagnosing aortic dissection, and the image above makes this diagnasis very clear. We see a descending aorta that has both a true and a \"false\" lumen separated by an intimal flap, and an ascending aorta that is normal in comparison. Far patients unable to tolerate iodinated contrast, transesophageal echocardiography can also be used for diagnosis.\nThe patient above has a Stanford type B (descending aorta only) dissection. In patients wha are hypertensive, both type A and type B aortic dissections are treated acutely with intravenous labetalol. Beta-blockers are ideal because they simultaneously lower the heart rate and blood pressure, minimizing stress an the aortic wall. Type A dissections typically require surgery in addition to medical therapy, while type B dissections can usually be managed with medical therapy alone.\n(Choice B) Nifedipine vasodilates to decrease blood pressure. Vasodilation can induce a reflex tachycardia, which would increase aortic shear stress. Vasodilators should only be considered in the treatment of aortic dissection if further blood pressure lowering is needed after beta-blockers have been administered.\n(Choice C) Heparin must be avoided when there is any suspicion of aortic dissection. An anticoagulant, heparin would inhibit the body's efforts to contain the dissection and could greatly exacerbate the condition.\n(Choice D) Hydrochlorothiazide is not a component of the acute management of aortic dissection since itis not a fast-acting antihypertensive.\n(Choice E) Hydralazine, like nifedipine, vasodilates, and would increase shear stress on the aorta. Hydralazine alone should not be used to treat aartic dissection.\n(Choice F) Fibrinalytics like streptokinase should never be used if aortic dissection is suspected. By dissolving blood clots, streptokinase would inhibit the body's efforts to contain the dissection and could greatly exacerbate the candition.\nEducational objective:\nBeta-blockade is the most appropriate initial intervention for acute aortic dissection. Type A dissections involve the ascending aorta and are treated with medical therapy and surgery, while Type B dissections involve anly the descending aorta and are usually treated with medical therapy alone."

    "question": "A 70-year-old male is brought to the ER, by his wife, because he lost consciousness while getting up in the marning. The syncaopal episode lasted for several minutes, and the patient rapidly recovered consciousness. He had diarrhea and a decreased appetite ane day earlier, which resalved spontaneously. His past medical history is significant far hypertension that is effectively controlled with the combination of hydrochlorathiazide/amiloride. His blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, while supine, and 98/50 mm Hg, while standing. The physical examination revealed a mucosal dryness. The EKG is normal. Which af the following labaratory values is the mast sensitive indicator of the patient's underlying condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Decreased sodium concentration in the urine",
      "B. Hypokalemia",
      "C. Increased BUN/creatinine ratio",
      "D. Metabolic acidosis",
      "E. Decreased hemotocrit"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The most probable cause of the syncopal episode, in this patient, is postural hypotension, induced by mild hypovolemia. The clues to the correct diagnosis are a recent episode of diarrhea with decreased appetite (decreased food and fluid intake), diuretic therapy, and mild mucosal dryness. There are two very impartant points you should remember from this scenario. The first point is that elderly patients very poorly tolerate even what seems to be an insignificant loss of fluid. The second paint is that mild hypovalemia may predispose an individual (especially elderly) to orthostatic syncope after bed rest (like nighttime sleep) because it takes time for the body to adjust to the sudden change in the body position. This is caused by getting up fram the bed. Increased BUM/creatinine ratio is a sensitive indicator of the patient's hydration status, although it is not very specific.\nDecreased urine sodium concentration (Choice A) occurs during dehydration, but taking saluretics may make this test useless.\nHypokalemia (Choice B) and metabolic acidosis (Choice D) can complicate this patient's condition, but they are not good markers of hypovolemia.\nHematocrit decrease (Choice E) should be expected during blood loss. Dehydration usually causes an increased hematocrit, secondary to hemoconcentration.\nEducational objective:\nElderly patients are particularly sensitive to fluid loss, and even mild hypovolemia may predispose them to arthostatic syncope, especially upan getting up in the morning. BUN/creatinine ratio is a useful indicatar of dehydration."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man complains of lower leg swelling, fatigue and poor appetite. His past medical history is significant for recurrent chest infections, wheezing, cough, recent pyelonephritis, and arterial hypertension. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day but denies alcohol or intravenous drug use. His physical examination reveals a barrel-shaped chest with bilateral scattered wheezes. His abdomen is distended and his liver edge is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. You note pitting edema and dilated, tortuous, superficial veins over the bilateral lower extremities. Manual pressure on the abdomen causes persistent distention of the jugular veins. The patient's serum sodium level is 135 mEg/L and his creatinine concentration is 1.2 mg/dl. An abnormality of which of the following is most likely ta explain his edema?",
    "options": [
      "A. Serum albumin level",
      "B. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure",
      "C. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure",
      "D. Portal venous resistance",
      "E. Urinary protein excretion"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has recurrent pulmanary infections, chranic cough, a significant smaking history, and an increased anterior-posterior chest diameter and wheezing on physical examination, all consistent with chranic obstructive lung disease. The associated chronic hypoxemia causes constriction of the pulmonary arterial system and, with time, leads to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular failure. Right heart failure has in turn caused this patient's elevated jugular venous pressure, congestive hepatasplenomegaly, hepatojugular reflux, and lower extremity edema.\n(Choice A) A low serum albumin level can cause anasarca as fluid moves from the vascular system into the interstitium to equalize osmotic pressures. The leading causes of hypoalbuminemia are nephrotic syndrome and poor albumin synthesis due to cirrhasis or malnutrition.\n(Choice C) The pulmanary capillary wedge pressure reflects the left atrial pressure. This pressure is elevated in cases of left ventricular failure, but is nat elevated in right ventricular failure with pulmonary hypertension because the pathologic lesion is before the pulmonary capillary bed. Crackles on lung exam suggest volume overload in the pulmonary capillaries and pulmonary edema.\n(Choice D) Fortal hypertension is the hallmark of cirrhosis. This patient does not have significant risk factors for cirrhosis (e.g. alcoholism, hepatitis C) and does not have other stigmata of chronic liver disease like spider angiomata, palmar erythema, or caput medusa.\n(Choice E) Mephrotic range proteinuria (greater than 3g protein/day) is an important cause of systemic edema. However, this patient has more risk factors for secondary pulmonary hypertension than nephrotic syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nRight ventricular failure will cause elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema, but is not a common cause of pulmaonary edema."

    "question": "A 60-year-old male presents to the emergency room with the chief complaint of progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue. He denies any chest pain, syncope, cough, or edema. He suffered an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction one month ago. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in his lower chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a pansystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla. ECG shows previously present unchanged Q waves and a persistent ST segment elevation in the anterior leads. Based an these findings, what is the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Interventricular wall rupture",
      "B. Ventricular free wall rupture",
      "C. Pulmonary infarction",
      "D. Recurrent ischemia",
      "E. Right ventricular infarction",
      "F. Papillary muscle rupture",
      "G. Aortic dissection",
      "H. Acute pericarditis",
      "I. Ventricular aneurysm"
    ],
    "answer": "I",
    "explanation": "Yentricular aneurysm is a complication that may occur days to months after myocardial infarction. Camman consequences of ventricular aneurysms include symptoms of CHF | ventricular arrhythmias, mitral regurgitation, and/or thrombus formation. This patient's physical exam finding of a pansystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla is suggestive of mitral regurgitation, the result of aneurysmal alterations of the ventricular geometry. Persistent ST elevations are often seen on ECG in ventricular aneurysm. Echocardiography demonstrating dyskinetic wall motion of a portion of the left ventricle may be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Interventricular wall rupture typically occurs around & days after infarction and causes an acute left-to-right shunt with right sided heart failure and new-onset systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.\n(Choice B) Ventricular free wall rupture typically occurs around 5 days after myocardial infarction and causes acute pericardial tamponade and rapid decompensation with pulseless electrical activity.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary infarction secondary to pulmonary embolism can cause dyspnea, but it should not cause new anset mitral regurgitation or ST elevations on ECG.\n(Choice D) Recurrent ischemia is a consideration, given the ST elevations on ECG. However, it appears that the ST elevations and Q waves are unchanged since the initial infarction. These findings are more consistent with ventricular aneurysm.\n(Choice E) Right ventricular infarction can occur with inferior wall MI, but usually not with anterior wall MI. Since LV function is relatively preserved in RY infarction, crackles would not be expected on lung exam.\n(Choice F) Papillary muscle rupture typically accurs 3-7 days after an infarct and can cause severe acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema. It does not typically cause persistent ST elevations an ECG.\n(Choice H) Acute pericarditis can occur in the first several days after infarction, while Dressler's syndrome is an immune-mediated pericarditis that can occur weeks to manths after infarction. Diffuse ST elevations are typically present on ECG, and positional chest pain is usually the primary complaint.\nEducational objective:\nVentricular aneurysm is a late complication of myocardial infarction characterized by persistent ST elevations an ECG. Patients may have CHF, ventricular arrhythmias, and/or thrombus farmation along with mitral regurgitation."

    "question": "A 65-year-old male presents to your office with a six-month history of periodic substernal pain. The pain episodes are experienced during strong emotion, last for 10-15 minutes, and resolve spontaneously. He has a long history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type 2. His right foot was amputated two years ago due to diabetes-related complications. You suspect angina pectoris and decide to perform myacardial perfusion scanning. It reveals uniform distribution of isotope at rest, but inhomogenesity of the distribution after dipyridamale injection. You conclude that the patient has ischemic heart disease. Which of the following effects of dipyridamole helped you in making the diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increased heart contractility",
      "B. Coronary steal",
      "C. Dilation of diseased vessels",
      "D. Inhibition of platelet aggregation",
      "E. Placebo effect"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The histary is suggestive of angina pectoris in this patient (episodes of substernal pain provoked by emation). Exercise testing is not possible, because this patient's activity is limited by amputation. Myocardial perfusion scanning can be employed instead using dipyridamole ta reveal the areas of restricted myocardial perfusion.\nDipyridamole and adenosine are coronary vasodilators. Infusion of these substances in patients without coranary artery disease, increases caranary blood flow three to five times above the baseline levels. However, in patients with caranary artery disease, the diseased vessels distal to the obstruction are already maximally dilated (Choice C), and their ability to increase myocardial perfusion is limited; therefore, redistribution of caranary blood flow to 'non-diseased’ areas occurs, and the perfusion of 'diseased' segments diminishes. This phenomenon demanstrated by dipyridamale is called coronary steal and is used to diagnose ischemic heart disease.\nDipyridamaole is a patent antiplatelet aggregate (Choice D), but this property is not employed to assist in diagnosis. Increased cardiac contractility (Choice A) can occur as the result of vasodilatation, butitis a secondary phenomenan. Placebo effect (Choice E) is irrelevant in this case.\nEducational Objective:\nDipyridamaole can be used during myocardial perfusion scanning to reveal the areas of restricted myocardial perfusion. The redistribution of the coronary blood flow to 'non-diseased' segments induced by this drug is called coronary steal phenomenon."

He says he smokes a pack a day and drinks one to two beers every weekend. He has no allergies. Examination is unremarkable. The EKG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 72; there are frequent premature atrial beats present. The blood pressure is 120/65mm Hg. The next step in his management is:",
    "options": [
      "A. Digoxin",
      "B. Lidocaine",
      "C. Order potassium levels",
      "D. Complete electrophysiological study",
      "E. Observation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The diagnosis of atrial premature beats depends upan the recagnition of 'P' waves that are premature relative to sinus cycle length and which differ in morphology fram sinus 'P' waves. Atrial premature beats frequently reset the sinus node, producing pauses, which are only partially compensatory. The QRS width is normal.\nPremature atrial beats may be completely normal ar due to anxiety, CHF, hypoxia, caffeine or electrolyte abnormalities. Premature atrial beats never require any treatment and are completely benign (Option E).\n(Option A): Digoxin is a classic inotrope, which is frequently used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias, especially fibrillation. It increases the AY nodal refractoriness and thereby slows the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and flutter. Digoxin is particularly used in patients with heart failure {systolic dysfunction) and atrial fibrillation/flutter. Digoxin has na role in the management of premature atrial beats.\n(Option B): Lidocaine is a class 1 anti arrhythmic agent used in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. It has na role in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias. The drug is usually given intravenously.\n(Option C): Rarely premature atrial beats may be due to electrolyte abnormalities. In such cases, levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium may need to be evaluated. Removing the causative agent or replacing the deficient electrolyte can treat premature atrial beats. Electrolyte abnormalities are unlikely in a healthy patient without comorbid illnesses.\n(Option D): Electrophysiological study can establish whether an anomalous pathway is present or absent and allow its localization. Premature atrial beats do not have an anatomical disturbance and EF studies are not helpful at all.\nEducational objective:\nPremature atrial beats are benign and neither require any fallow up nor treatment."

    "question": "A 56-year-old white male presents with dyspnea for the last 3 manths. His dyspnea was initially exertional but it has worsened progressively and now he is breathless even at rest. He denies any chest pain ar ankle swelling. He has been smoking one-pack/day cigarettes for the last 30 years and has been drinking alcohal heavily for the last 10 years. He is not taking any medication. His mather died of breast cancer at 57. His vitals are, PR: 86/min, BP: 113/76mm of Hg; Temperature: 37.1C(98 9F); RR: 13/min. On auscultation of his precardium an S3 is heard, but there are no murmurs. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral basal crepitations. Chest x-ray shows marked cardiac silhouette enlargement and pulmonary venous congestion. EKG shows non-specific ST-T wave changes. Echocardiography shows a dilated left ventricle and systolic dysfunction (EF of 25-30%). CBC shows hematocrit of 32%, WBC count of 8,000/microL, and platelet count of 60,000/microL. Peripheral blood smear shaws MCV of 101 fL. LFTs show AST of 180U/L and ALT of 66 U/L. The findings of cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are not compatible with the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Which of the following measures is mast likely to reverse his heart failure?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cessation of cigarette smaking",
      "B. Abstinence from alcohal",
      "C. Reduced salt intake",
      "D. Use of ACE inhibitors",
      "E. Use of digoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is mast likely suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to alcoholism. Findings of thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis, and elevated transaminases are all suggestive af alcohalism in this patient. His cardiomyopathy could be due to ischemia but coranary angiography excluded this diagnosis in this patient. Total abstinence from alcohol is the mainstay of alcoholic cardiomyopathy management and it may reverse this condition if it is employed earlier in the course of the disease.\nReduced salt intake only improves symptoms of heart failure and does not reverse the disease process itself.\nDigitalis is most useful in those heart failure patients who have systolic dysfunction and have rapid ventricular rates due to atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. It proves to be useful in these cases by its positive inotropic effect and negative dromatropic (slowing AY conduction). Use of digitalis has not been shown to provide any survival advantage in patients with congestive heart failure and has not been shown ta reverse the disease process.\nACE inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression af heart failure but they don't reverse the disease process of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. ACE inhibitors should be given to all patients with heart failure who have systolic dysfunction unless they are contraindicated or the patients can't tolerate them.\nCigarette smoking is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and its cessation should be encouraged in all patients with heart failure. Cessation of cigarette smoking does not reverse the disease process of alcohalic cardiomyopathy.\nEducational Objective:\nKnow how to diagnose and manage a patient with congestive heart failure due to alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Decreased tolerance to glucose is a well-known side effect of thiazide diuretic therapy. This patient is predisposed to hyperglycemia due to characteristic constellation of metabolic syndrome (hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity). Thiazide diuretics can also unfavorably affect lipid metabolism by increased LDL cholesteral (Choice C) and plasma triglycerides (Choice D). In spite of these undesirable side effects, thiazide diuretics demonstrated decreased cardiovascular martality and morbidity at least equal to that of the novel agents (ACE inhibitars, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) in large-scale clinical trials. These beneficial long-term effects were shown in various subgroups of patients including diabetics. This patient is also at risk of acute gout arthritis due to uric acid retention induced by hydrochlorothiazide.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In addition to the normal S1 and S2, this patient's auscultatory findings demonstrate an additional diastalic sound just prior to S1 known as the fourth heart sound (S4). The presence of the fourth heart sound produces a rhythm that is often referred to as \"TEN-nes-see\", with S4 corresponding to the first syllable. In adults, the S4 is an indicator of a stiff left ventricle, which accurs in the setting of restrictive cardiomyopathy ar left ventricular hypertrophy fram prolonged hypertension. Occurring near the end of diastole, S4 corresponds with atrial contraction and is believed ta result from the sound of blood striking a stiffened left ventricle.\nThis patient's combination of exertional dyspnea and S4 likely indicate the presence of diastolic heart failure, which is most commonly the sequela of left ventricular hypertrophy fram prolonged hypertension.\n(Choice A) An ascending aortic aneurysm is often associated with aortic regurgitation, which would result in a diastolic murmur as opposed ta an extra heart sound.\n(Choice C) Mitral valve prolapse characteristically produces a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur heard best aver the cardiac apex.\n(Choice D) Fericardial effusions can be associated with acute pericarditis, which typically produces a pericardial friction rub on cardiac auscultation.\nEducational objective:\nThe fourth heart sound (S4) is a low frequency sound heard at the end of diastole just before S1 that is commonly associated with left ventricular hypertrophy from prolonged hypertension."

      "E. Alcohol cessation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "For abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAS) greater than about 5 cm in diameter, surgery is typically recommended. This cutoff was chosen because the risk of rupture increases dramatically at this diameter. For patients with smaller AAAs periodic imaging should be done to assess far aneurysm growth. Rapid growth itself can be an indication for surgical repair. Smoking is a major risk factor for aneurysm formation, enlargement, and rupture. Continued smaking increases the rate of aneurysm growth by about 25%. In most patients, atherosclerosis is the underlying precipitant for AAA formation, but altering ather atherosclerotic risk factors has not been demanstrated to have as much impact as smoking cessation. Thus, smoking cessation is the medical intervention with the greatest potential impact far this patient.\n(Choice A) Hypertension is a risk factor far atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation. Hypertensian in patients with AAA should be treated with beta-blockers.\n(Choice B) Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for AAA development and should be treated, but will not have as much impact on AAA progression as smaking cessation.\n(Choice C) Improved diabetes contral will improve the patient's averall survival, but will not have much impact on progression of AAA size as smoking cessation.\n(Choice E) Alcohol cessation will undoubtedly improve the patient's overall health, but will nat slow progression of AAA size.\nEducational objective:\nIndications for surgery in patients with AAA include; diameter greater than about 5 cm, presence of symptoms, or rapid rate af growth. For patients being medically managed, smoking cessation is the intervention with the greatest likelihood of slowing A&A progression."

Involvement of the right ventricle is present in 1/3 of inferior infarcts. Furthermore, ST depression in leads I and AVL (the left-most leads) may reflect STEMI affecting the right side of the heart. Right sided ECG leads can be placed to confirm a right ventricular infarct. Jugular venous distention and Kussmaul's sign (increase in JVD with inspiration) alang with clear lung fields all point towards right ventricular failure. Failure of the right ventricle leads to decreased preload, and therefore can result in decreased cardiac output and hypatension. This patient also has a relatively low heart rate given her hypotension which is suggestive of possible SA node ischemia. Patients with right ventricular infarcts require a high preload to maintain their blood pressure, and are therefore treated with IV fluids. Preload reducing agents such as nitroglycerine and diuretics must be avoided.\n(Answer A) Pulmonary thromboembalism can often present similarly to right ventricular infarction, with right sided heart failure and hypatensian if the embolus is massive. The finding of ST Elevation on the EKG points towards MI, whereas PE is more likely ta present with sinus tachycardia, new onset RBBB or S1Q3T3 on EEE\n(Answer C) Interventricular septum rupture can lead to a left-to-right shunt. The resulting increased strain an the right ventricle can result in right ventricular failure. However, a pansystalic murmur would likely be heard an exam and ST elevations would not be expected.\n(Answer D) Variant angina may present with transient ST elevations, but should not cause hypotension ar physical exam findings of right sided heart failure.\n(Answer E) Intravascular volume depletion can cause hypotensian, but is associated with flattened jugular veins and nat elevated VF.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with an inferior MI may suffer right ventricular infarction, leading to right sided heart failure. Hypotension, jugular venous distention and clear lung fields should raise suspicion for right ventricular infarction. Such patients are preload dependent and should be treated with IV fluids and avoidance of preload reducing medications such as nitrates and diuretics."

    "question": "A 72-year-old male is admitted to the hospital with chest pain. EKG and cardiac enzymes confirm a myocardial infarction and he is started on nitroglycerine, aspirin, simvastatin and low molecular weight heparin. Four days later, he complains of leg pain. Physical examination reveals a cold, pale leg. The angiogram is shown below.\nWhat is the best next step in his management?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Intravenous streptokinase",
      "B. Clopidogrel",
      "C. Cilostazol",
      "D. Leg elevation and warm compress",
      "E. Embolectomy"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's angiogram is diagnostic of acute popliteal artery occlusion. Contrast can be seen filling the superior partion of the artery before the column of contrast abruptly ends in the popliteal fossa — a pattern suggestive of embolic occlusion. Clinically, \"5 P's\" point toward this diagnosis: pain, pulselessness, paresthesia, paikilothermia (coldness), and pallor. Associated morbidity and mortality are significant, so one must maintain a high index of suspicion. The patient's recent myocardial infarction makes an embalus from the heart a likely culprit. Heparin therapy should be initiated based on a suggestive histary and physical exam, without delay far confirmatory testing. For a limb that is still viable, the next treatment step is either percutaneous thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy. Since this patient has already had an angiogram, intra-arterial thrombolysis ar mechanical embaolectomy could be attempted. Surgical embalectamy is an option as well. For a nonviable limb, surgery is mandatory.\n(Choice A) Streptokinase is a fibrinolytic agent. While intravenous infusion of a fibrinalytic agent is an option for STEMI patients, patients with acute limb ischemia typically are treated with direct intra-arterial, not intravenous, administration of a fibrinolytic agent an the clot using an angiographic catheter.\n(Choice B) Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that promotes anticoagulation, but does not rapidly break up already existing clots.\n(Choice C) Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation and causes vasodilation. It is sometimes used to treat chronic claudication, but it has na rale in acute limb ischemia.\n(Choice D) Leg elevation and warm campresses would be inadequate therapy for this patient since his limb is likely to soon become nonviable.\nEducational objective:\nThe diagnosis of acute limb ischemia should be considered in patients who present with the \"five P's\"; pain, pulselessness, paresthesias, poikilothermia (coldness), and pallor. Angiography will typically shaw an abrupt cutoff of arterial blood flow. IV heparin should be started immediately upon suspicion. The definitive treatment is surgical embaolectomy or intra-arterial fibrinolysis/mechanical embolectamy via interventional radiology."

    "question": "A 53-year-old man presents to your office complaining of weakness and exertional dyspnea aver the last week. He denies chest pain and palpitations. He has no other past medical history. His father died of a myacardial infarction at age 55. On exam, his heart rate is 100/min and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. Internal jugular venous pulsation is observed 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart sounds are muffled. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's complaints?",
    "options": [
      "A. Decreased cardiac contractility",
      "B. Left ventricular outflow obstruction",
      "C. Decreased left ventricular preload",
      "D. Pulmonary hypertension",
      "E. Increased right ventricular compliance"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has all three of Beck's triad for cardiac tamponade: hypotension, jugular venous distention (JVD), and muffled heart sounds. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial space fills with fluid. This can result fram many causes, including infection, myocardial infarction, malignancy, uremia, and trauma. Of note, the degree of clinical symptoms depends largely an how quickly the pericardial fluid accumulates. The faster it accumulates, the sooner symptoms will develop.\nThe pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade is as follows. When fluid in the pericardial sac causes the pressure to rise above the diastolic pressure of the ventricles, the ventricles become less able to expand to accept venous return to the heart. As a result of the decrease in preload, stroke volume falls and thus cardiac output is reduced. The decrease in cardiac output is further exacerbated during inspiration because the lower intrathoracic pressure allows mare systemic venous blood to return to the right ventricle, causing the intraventricular septum to bow inta the left ventricle and further reduce left ventricular filling. This phenomenan is responsible for the finding of pulsus paradoxus on exam. A hepatojugular reflex might alsa be observed on exam.\n(Choice A) Decreased cardiac contractility is observed in patients with systolic heart failure. They will typically have signs of both left ventricular failure (e.g. crackles on pulmanary exam and an S3) and right ventricular failure (e.g., JVD and peripheral edema). The patient in this vignette does not have signs of left ventricular failure.\n(Choice B) Left ventricular outflow obstruction results from critical aortic stenosis or from hypertrophic abstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Although this patient does have exertional dyspnea, there is no ather suggestion of aortic stenosis (e.g., syncope, systolic murmur) in this vignette, and most patients with HOCM present at a much earlier age. Importantly, the systolic murmur of HOCM will decrease with squatting and increase with straining.\n(Choice D) Fulmanary hypertension can result from increased pulmonary arterial pressure, as with primary pulmanary hypertension, or with increased pulmonary venous pressure, as occurs in left ventricular failure. The cardiac exam will reveal a loud S2. Pulmanary arterial hypertension is typically an indolent process and does not present as right heart failure until late in the disease.\n(Choice E) Right ventricular compliance will decrease, not increase, in cardiac tamponade.\nEducational Objective:\nThe classic physical exam findings of cardiac tamponade are pulsus paradoxus and Beck's triad: hypotension, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds. When the pericardial space fills with fluid, the ventricles are less able to expand to accept venous return to the heart. As a result, overall preload to the heart decreases."

      "G. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome",
      "H. Sympathomimetic toxicity"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This young military recruit was likely engaged in strenuous exercise at the time of his callapse. Although no mention is made of the outdoor conditions, itis likely that he was exposed to hot, humid weather. In atmospheres with mare than 75% humidity, sweating (the body's main mechanism of heat dissipation) may become ineffective, and hyperthermia can result. Furthermaore, this patient was taking an antihistamine, which also has anticholinergic activity and can further impair heat dissipation.\nHeat stroke is defined as a body temperature above 40.5°C (105°F) (Choice A). Dehydration is comman in heat stroke, and is manifested in this patient by hot, dry skin and hypotension. Tachycardia, tachypnea and hemocaoncentration are all signs consistent with dehydration as well. Hyperthermia in heat stroke disrupts enzymatic activity, resulting in multi-organ system effects. Seizures, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hepatic/renal failure may occur. In this patient, ARDS is indicated by scattered rales on exam, and DIC is suggested by low platelets and PT/PTT prolongation.\n(Choice B) Meningitis is unlikely given the lack of nuchal rigidity or photosensitivity. Also, the onset of meningitis is rarely so acute.\n(Choice C) Anticholinergic toxicity may present with hot dry skin, tachycardia, and hyperthermia, as in this patient. However, bowel sounds would be absent, and systemic effects like DIC and ARDS would not be expected.\n(Choice D & G) Serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) belong in the differential for patients with hyperthermia. However, hypertension and neuromuscular hyperactivity are praminent in these conditions.\n(Choice E) Thyroid storm presents with tachycardia, hyperthermia, and altered mental status. However, DIC and ARDS are not expected.\n(Choice F) A hypothalamic stroke would cause dysregulation of one's body temperature and metabolism. This diagnosis is unlikely in this young, healthy patient and would not explain his pulmonary and hematologic symptoms.\n(Choice H) Sympathomimetic toxicity may present with hyperthermia. However, hypertension and mydriasis would be expected, rather than the findings described here.\nEducational objective:\nHeat stroke is defined as a temperature above 40.5°C (105°F). Exertional heat stroke occurs in otherwise healthy individuals exercising in extreme heat. Dehydration, hypotension, tachycardia and tachypnea are comman. Systemic effects like seizures, ARDS, DIC, and hepatic/renal failure may alsa occur."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has developed difficulty concentrating, fatigue, dry skin, and weight gain while receiving treatment for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. These symptoms are concerning for amiodarane-induced hypothyroidism. Because of this adverse effect of amiodarone use, patients receiving amiodarone therapy must have their TSH followed regularly. Amiodarane can alsa cause lung fibrosis and liver toxicity, thus, patients require regular assessments of pulmanary function and liver enzyme concentrations as well.\n(Choice A) Hydralazine can cause salt retention, reflex tachycardia, and a lupus-like syndrome.\n(Choice B) Metoprolol can cause impatence, bradycardia, and AY node blockade.\n(Choice C) Comman side effects of verapamil include constipation, dizziness, and flushing.\n(Choice D) Enalapril is most commonly associated with hyperkalemia, cough, decreased GFR rash, and angioedema.\n(Choice F) Digoxin can cause nausea, vamiting, diarrhea, blurry yellow vision, and arrhythmias.\nEducational objective:\nAmiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic but its use is associated with several potential side effects. In particular, it can cause pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, and thyroid dysfunction. Pulmonary function tests, liver function tests, and thyroid function tests should be monitored in patients on chranic amiodarone therapy."

He says his symptoms are worst while lying supine and while lying on his left side. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 150/55 mmHg and heart rate is 73/min. Which of the following is most likely responsible for his symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aortic regurgitation",

      "D. Tricuspid stenosis",
      "E. Aortic stenosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Aartic regurgitation (AR) is associated with a wide pulse pressure (systolic — diastolic blood pressure), 95 mmHg in this patient. A wide pulse pressure causes a \"water hammer pulse,\" which many patients experience as a pounding heartbeat. Lying flat and turning to the left brings the heart closer ta the chest wall and can make the patient mare aware of the farceful heartbeat. Inthe U.S. aortic root dilation and bicuspid aortic valve are the most common causes of AR In many other countries where antibiotics are less available, rheumatic fever is the most comman cause.\n(Choice B) Fulmanary regurgitation should not cause widening of the peripheral pulse pressure.\n(Choice C) Mitral stenosis can also accur secandary to rheumatic heart disease, but typically causes pulmanary symptoms like pulmonary edema and hemoptysis. Mitral stenosis would nat be expected to cause widening of the peripheral pulse pressure.\n(Choice D) Tricuspid stenosis typically causes symptoms of right sided heart failure with clear lungs. The peripheral pulse pressure would nat be increased.\n(Choice E) In contrast to the \"water hammer pulse\" of AR patients with aortic stenosis usually have a weak pulse described as \"parvus et tardus\"\nEducational objective:\nAartic regurgitation causes widening of the pulse pressure, which can be felt as a \"water hammer\" pulse. Lying down and turning to the left brings the heart closer to the chest wall and can make the patient more aware of the forceful heartbeat."

      "E. Aortic dissection",
      "F. Pulmonary infarction"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's dilated pupils and blood-crusted nose suggest cocaine abuse. Cocaine inhibits catecholamine reuptake from neuronal synapses, and is therefore sympathomimetic. In some, cocaine-induced vasospasm can be so severe as to cause myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, which, given this patient's chest pain and ST elevations, is likely the case here. Patients may not always be forthcoming about drug use, so itis impartant to maintain a high index of suspician in the right clinical setting. Cocaine-induced ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) are treated the same as classic STEMIs, with PTCA ar thrombolysis. Aspirin and nitrates are also appropriate, but beta-blockers should be avoided. Beta-blocker therapy administered to cocaine-using individuals allows unopposed alpha agonist activity that can worsen vasospasm. Calcium channel blockers and alpha blockers like phentolamine can alsa help reduce vasospasm in these patients.\n(Choice A) Atherosclerotic heart disease would be rare in a patient this young without documented additional risk factors.\n(Choice B) Acute pericarditis can cause ST elevations on EKG, which are often accompanied by PR depressions. Pericarditis is not a comman complication of cocaine use.\n(Choice C) Fleuradynia is chest pain typically of pulmanary etiology that is warse with deep breathing. While cocaine can cause pleuritic chest pain through a variety of different mechanisms, ST elevations would not be expected on EKG.\n(Choice E) While cocaine can cause aortic dissection, this patient's ST elevations are more suggestive of myocardial infarctian.\nEducational objective:\nFupillary dilation and blood at the external nares in a patient with chest pain can be a clue to cocaine-induced vasospasm. ST elevation myocardial infarctions can occur as a consequence of cocaine use."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Cphthalmoscopy is an important component of the evaluation of patients with hypertension. Presence of papilledema in this patient is consistent with a diagnosis of malignant hypertension. Although the blood pressure of the patients with malignant hypertension is usually >= 200/140 mmHg (Choice E}, papiledema should be present in arder to make a diagnosis of malignant hypertension. Renal failure with elevated creatinine level (Choice B) and aliguria (Choice D) can develop rapidly in this case without treatment, but its presence is nat required to diagnose malignant hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG (Choice A) is nat a diagnostic criterion for malignant hypertension.\nEducational Objective:\nAlways suspect malignant hypertension in patients with very high blood pressure (>= 200/140 mmHg). Presence of papilledema on ophthalmascaopy confirms the diagnosis. The pathologic change responsible for end-argan damage in malignant hypertension is fibrinoid necrosis of small arterioles."

    "explanation": "This patient's highly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) points towards muscle injury, a possible side effect of statins. The muscle injury can progress to rhabdomyolysis with renal failure, sa statin medications should be stopped in patients wha develop highly elevated CFKs. This patient's BUN and creatinine are also elevated, comparison to prior labs would be helpful in determining if this renal compromise is acute ar chronic. This patient alsa has slightly elevated transaminases, another potential side effect of statin therapy.\n(Choice A) Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blacker (ARB), and as such its comman side effects are hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal failure.\n(Choice C) N-acetylcysteine has three primary uses: dissolution of mucus, protection against contrast induced renal failure, and therapy far acetaminophen averdase.\n(Choice D & E) The mild elevation of this patient's transaminases is likely the result of his statin therapy. To confirm that this is the case, liver function tests can be repeated after the statin is stopped to ensure that the AST and ALT are trending dawn.\nEducational objective:\nCPK levels should be checked in any patient on a statin who presents with myalgias.

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cutaneous flushing and intensive generalized pruritis are well-known side effects of high-dose niacin therapy (high dose is required to treat lipid abnormalities). These effects are explained by niacin-induced peripheral vasodilatation, not vasoconstriction (Choice D). The mechanism invalved in this reaction is believed to be drug-induced release af histamine and prostaglandins, but not a true hypersensitivity reaction (Choice A). The role of prostaglandins in this reaction is canfirmed by the fact that low-dose aspirin can greatly reduce ar prevent cutaneous flushing and pruritis if taken 30 minutes before niacin. Therefore, niacin is frequently prescribed with aspirin. It is important to know that flushing and pruritis usually improve after 2-4 weeks of therapy.\nThiazide diuretics do nat intensify this reaction (Choice C), although may predispose the patient to hypotension.\nPsychogenic cause (Choice E) of the patient's complaint is unlikely.\nEducational Objective:\nHigh-dose niacin therapy that is used to treat lipid abnormalities frequently produces cutaneous flushing and pruritis.

      "E. Blood drug level",
      "F. PT, INR measurement",
      "G. ECG stress testing"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This is a patient receiving treatment for chronic atrial fibrillation who presents with diarrhea and nausea. Given her medication list, the most likely culprit for her symptoms is digoxin intoxication. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used ta treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Because it has myriad adverse effects, patient's digoxin levels must be monitored closely. Potential side effects of digoxin include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurry yellow vision, and arrhythmias. Characteristic ECG findings in digoxin toxicity include scooped ST segments, prolonged PR intervals, shortened QT intervals, and T-wave inversion. Renal failure and hypokalemia exacerbate digoxin toxicity.\n(Choice A) Echocardiography can be beneficial in evaluating systolic and diastolic function, ejection fraction, wall motion abnormalities, and valve disorders. This patient does not have clinical features suggestive of heart failure.\n(Choice B) Aside from wheezes on exam, this patient does not clinical signs suggestive of a primary pulmonary process. Mareaver, none of her medications cause significant pulmanary toxicity, and lung disease would probably not cause her Gl symptoms.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary function tests are used to diagnose restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases. Although she has wheezing on physical exam, which may suggest a component of branchoconstriction, neither COPD nor asthma would account for her Gl symptoms.\n(Choice D) TSH, T3, and T4 levels are measured to evaluate a patient's thyroid function. Hyperthyroidism can cause diarrhea, palpitations, and changes in appetite. However, it is mare likely that this patient's presentation is related to an adverse medication effect rather than to a new disease process.\n(Choice F) Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, affects the PT and INR. The goal for warfarin therapy in atrial fibrillation is an INR between 2 and 3, and this patient was at that goal on the most recent evaluation. Furthermore, she is not demonstrating any symptoms suggestive of an angoing coagulopathy.\n(Choice G) Stress testing would be a reasonable investigation in an older woman complaining of palpitations, but caranary artery disease would not explain this patient's Gl symptoms. Mareover, an ECG stress test can be very difficult to interpret in someone with baseline ECG abnormalities from digoxin use.\nEducational Objective:\nDigoxin is a cardiac glycoside whose adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, vision changes, and arrhythmias. Patient's digoxin levels must be followed closely."

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The first step in managing this patient should be to obtain an exercise EKG, as the exertional nature af his discomfort is concerning for ischemic heart disease. Both SLE and chronic steroid use are risk factars for accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. Exercise may induce ischemic changes on EKG that might not be present at rest. Since the patient's baseline EKG is normal and he is able to exercise, imaging with the stress test (Choice D) is unnecessary. If the stress test is normal, then further warkup for the cause of the burning sensation could be dane, probably focusing on a possible Gl etiology.\n(Choice A) In a patient with baseline EKG changes, an exercise echocardiogram can help assess for regional wall motion abnormalities. A resting echocardiogram, however, is not an effective test for coronary artery disease.\n(Choice B) Coronary angiography is the gold standard for detecting coronary artery disease, but is probably more aggressive than is necessary at this time. If the patient's stress test is positive, coronary angiography may be necessary.\n(Choice E) Esophageal motility studies can be useful in patients with dysphagia or suspected diffuse esophageal spasm or nutcracker esophagus. This patient's pattern of discomfort with exertion makes Gl etiologies less likely.\n(Choice F) Upper Gl endoscopy to look for peptic ulcer disease would likely be the next test performed if this patient's stress test is negative.\nEducational objective:\nIschemic cardiac pain can sometimes be mistaken for epigastric pain, but should remain high an the differential, especially in the setting of symptoms warsened with exertion. An exercise stress test without imaging is the mast reasonable first step if the baseline resting EKG is normal."

    "question": "A 64-year-old white female presents for evaluation of two weeks of decreased appetite and nausea. She also notes occasional palpitations, which have been especially prominent over the past two days. Her medical history is significant for an anterior wall myocardial infarction one year ago and secondary congestive heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Her current medications include aspirin, digoxin, furosemide, enalapril and metoprolol. On physical examination, her blood pressure is120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 106/min and respirations are 15/min. The remainder of her exam is unremarkable. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette and normal lung fields. On labaratary testing, her digoxin level is twice the upper limit of normal. You order an EKG. Which of the following arrhythmias is most specific for digitalis toxicity?",
    "options": [
      "A. Atrial flutter",
      "B. Atrial fibrillation",
      "C. Mobitz type II second-degree AV block",
      "D. Atrial tachycardia with AV block",
      "E. Multifocal atrial tachycardia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Atrial tachycardia with AV block is the arrhythmia mast specific for digitalis toxicity. Digitalis can increase ectopy in the atria or ventricles, which can lead ta atrial tachycardia. Atrial tachycardia is distinguished fram atrial flutter by its somewhat slower atrial rate (150-250 bpm as opposed to 250-350 bpm). P-waves are present, but may appear different fram the p-waves normally seen when conduction originates in the SA node. In atrial tachycardia, the closer the ectopic focus is ta the SA node, the closer the resemblance of its p-waves to normal p-waves originating from the SA node. In addition ta causing ectopic rhythms, digitalis can alsa increase vagal tone and decrease conduction through the AY node, potentially causing AY block. Since it is rare for both ectopy and AV block to occur at the same time, when they do, the combination is fairly specific for digitalis toxicity.\n(Choice A) Digitalis toxicity does not commanly cause atrial flutter.\n(Choice B) There are many potential causes of atrial fibrillation, but digitalis toxicity is not one of them. Digitalis can be used to increase vagal tone and is sometimes used to treat atrial fibrillation if beta-blockers ar calcium channel blockers have not been completely effective.\n(Choice C) Digitalis would not be expected to cause Mobitz type II second-degree AV black, as this invalves pathology of the conduction system belaw the AV node.\n(Choice E) Multifocal atrial tachycardia is rarely associated with digitalis use. Itis mare commonly a consequence of pulmonary disease.\nEducational objective:\nDigitalis toxicity causes increased ectopy and increased vagal tone. Atrial tachycardia with AV block occurs fram the combination of these two digitalis effects, and is relatively specific far digitalis toxicity."

    "question": "A 63-year-old male is admitted for sudden onset severe chest pain. His ECG reveals ST elevation in leads V2-V6. He is treated with thrombolytic therapy, heparin, aspirin, metoprolol, morphine, and nitrates. A coronary angiogram performed after thrombolytic therapy reveals 50% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient suddenly develops severe shortness of breath at rest and hypotension. Examination reveals a soft S1, an apical pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla, and bibasilar crackles. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure is 92/58 mm Hg, heart rate is 102/min, and respirations are 31/min. An echocardiogram performed on the second hospital day reveals an akinetic region of the anterior wall. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration?",
    "options": [
      "A. Pericardial tamponade",
      "B. Pulmonary embolism",
      "C. Rupture of ventricular septum",
      "D. Papillary muscle dysfunction",
      "E. Acute aortic dissection"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient suffered an anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) and was treated appropriately. The development of hemodynamic campromise 3-7 days after an Ml raises suspicion for mechanical complications of MI, as this is the point during the healing process in which the infarcted myocardium is softest and most prone to rupture. The three major mechanical complications of Ml include mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture, left ventricle free wall rupture, and interventricular septum rupture. While all three complications can result in hypotension, the presence of a pansystalic murmur that is loudest at the apex with radiation to the axilla is the classic murmur of mitral regurgitation. S1 is the sound formed by closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves, and improper closure af the mitral valve will soften S1. Shartness of breath and bibasilar crackles are indicative of pulmonary edema and left ventricular failure. Therefore, these clinical manifestations are consistent with acute mitral regurgitation.\n(Choice A) Rupture of the left ventricular free wall classically results in pericardial tamponade. While this condition often results in sudden death, patients wha survive the initial insult may develop hypotension, jugular venous distension, distant heart sounds, pericardial rub, and pulsus paradoxus.\n(Choice B) This patient's mobility is likely compromised by his recent MI, thereby placing him at increased risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). PE frequently presents with dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hypotension. Mitral regurgitation or new onset murmurs are nat typically identified.\n(Choice C) Like papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal rupture results in a pansystolic murmur. It differs in that the murmur is heard best at the left sternal border, often has an accompanying thrill, and is less likely to radiate to the axilla.\n(Choice E) Acute aortic dissection classically presents with hypertension—nat hypotension, tearing chest ar back pain, and unequal pulses. This patient's murmur and pulmanary edema are not characteristic of aortic dissection.\nEducational Objective:\nThe three major mechanical complications of Ml include mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture, left ventricle free wall rupture, and interventricular septum rupture. While all three of these developments can result in hypotension, a pansystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex with radiation to the axilla is the classic characterization of mitral regurgitation."

    "question": "A 34-year-old female presents to your office complaining of pressure-like, substernal chest pain that has been affecting her recently when she plays active sports. Resting consistently alleviates the pain. She denies any associated nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, dyspnea, palpitations ar syncope. Family history is non-contributary. On physical examination, her pulse is 79/min and blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation reveals a high-pitched 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the second right intercostal space.

      "E. Stretching of the papillary muscles"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's exertional chest pain that improves with rest suggests angina. The description of her murmur is consistent with aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis in a young individual is usually the result of a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. Patients with severe aortic stenosis often have large left ventricular mass, which then requires additional oxygen. In such patients, increased myocardial oxygen demand can cause anginal pain. Accompanying prolonged myocardial contraction and impaired diastale, both of which reduce blood flow through the coronary arteries, exacerbate the situation. (Given her histary and young age, hypertrophic abstructive cardiomyopathy should also be considered. However, the classic murmur of this condition is usually located at the left lower sternal border.)\n(Choice A) &n anomalous right caronary artery arigin can lead to angina if the artery is compressed by other structures, but there should be no murmur an cardiac auscultation.\n(Choice B) Atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronaries can lead ta symptoms of angina, but is unlikely in this patient given her young age and lack of risk factors.\n(Choice D) The myocardium is usually not able to increase its extraction of oxygen. Instead, the myocardium usually meets increased oxygen demands by inducing dilation of the coronary arteries.\n(Choice E) Stretching of the papillary muscles can lead to mitral regurgitation, but this murmur is normally heard best at the apex. Mitral regurgitation can occur secondary to myocardial ischemia, but it does not typically cause myocardial ischemia.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with severe aortic stenosis can have anginal chest pain due to increased myocardial oxygen demand."

      "D. Raynaud phenomenon",
      "E. Pulmonary embolism"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has variant angina, also known as Prinzmetal's angina. It is caused by temparary spasm of the coronary arteries, as opposed to atherosclerotic narrowing which is seen in myocardial infarction. Young women are classically affected, and the greatest risk factar far variant angina is smoking. Aside fram smoking, there is often an absence of cardiovascular risk factors. Variant angina is associated with other vasospastic disorders, such as Raynaud's phenomenon and migraine headaches. The episodes often occur in the middle of the night (midnight to 8 am) and are precipitated by exercise, hyperventilation, ematianal stress, cold exposure ar cocaine use. The angina episodes are accompanied by transient ST elevations with return of ST segments to baseline upon resolution of symptoms. This is in contrast to the ST depressions seen in unstable angina, and the longer duration of ST elevations seen in myocardial infarction. Medical therapy for variant angina typically involves calcium channel blockers ar nitrates.\n(Choice A) Lacunar strokes occur in the setting of hypertension, and affect small, penetrating arteries which supply the basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and pons. Occlusion of these small arteries by microatheroma and lipohyalinasis is the mechanism of lacunar stroke—not vasospasm.\n(Choices B & C) Intermittent claudication is leq pain that occurs with exercise and is due to atherosclerotic narrowing of the arteries feeding the leg. The mechanism is similar to that of typical angina--nat variant angina. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are alsa the result of atherosclerotic disease.\n(Choice E) The most comman cause of pulmanary embalism is embolization of blood clots from the deep veins of the lower extremities. Variant angina does nat involve embolic phenomena.\nEducational objective:\nYariant Angina (or Frinzmetal's angina) is a vasospastic disorder that typically occurs in young female smakers. Chest pain usually occurs in the middle of the night, and episodes are associated with transient ST elevations an ECG."

    "question": "An 84-year-old Caucasian male is brought to the ER with severe chest pain, dyspnea and diaphoresis. His past medical history is significant for a long history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type 2. He experienced a severe myocardial infarction 6 months ago. His current medications are enalapril, metapralal, aspirin, furosemide, potassium, glyburide and pravastatin, but he says that he has not been taking some of his medications recently. Physical examination reveals acrocyanosis and symmetric 3+ lower extremity edema. Point of maximal apical impulse is displaced to the left, and a holosystolic [IV/VI] apical murmur is heard at the apex. Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are present on ECG. The initial set of cardiac enzymes are positive. The patient continues to deteriorate, despite aggressive diuretic and vasodilator therapy. You perform an echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular function and decide to proceed with pulmonary artery catheterization. Cardiac index (CI), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and left ventricular end-diastalic volume (LVEDV) are determined. Which af the following is most likely to present in this patient?",

      "E. CI normal, TPR decreased, LVEDY increased"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is consistent with systolic heart failure. Non-compliance with the treatment regimen and acute myocardial damage are the precipitating factors for the acute distress observed in this patient.\nIt is important to know the basic pathophysiologic changes assaciated with heart failure. First, look at Cl, a measure of cardiac output - it is always decreased in systolic heart failure. Next, look at LVEDY - it should be elevated in systolic heart failure, although it may be normal in pure diastolic heart failure (choice D). TPR is elevated in systolic heart failure due to neurohumoral activation that includes sympathetic hyperactivity and activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\nSuboptimal left ventricular filling that may relatively reduce LVEDY can be due ta blood redistribution with low TFR (e.g., anaphylaxis) (choice A) or hypovolemia with elevated TPR (e.g., hemarrhage) (choice B).\nMarmal CI, elevated LVEDY and LVEDP, and decreased TPR can be caused sometimes by high-output heart failure (choice E).\nEducational Objective:\nSystolic heart failure is characterized by depressed cardiac index (Cl) accompanied by increased total peripheral resistance (TPR) and left ventricular end-diastalic volume (LVEDV)."

His EKG at the time of admission is shown below:\nWhich of the following most likely accounts for the observed EKG changes?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Ventricular preexcitation",
      "B. Impaired SA node automaticity",
      "C. Impaired AV node conduction",
      "D. Atrial reentry",
      "E. His bundle branch block"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The above EKG demonstrates an irregular rhythm, with P waves preceding every QRS but with certain P waves not conducted. Closer examination reveals PR intervals that grow progressively longer between beats, leading up to a dropped beat. This pattern is consistent with second degree, Mabitz type I AV block (Wenckebach). Mobitz type I black is due to dysfunction at the AY node. Patients are generally asymptomatic, but in some cases the dropped beats cause hypoperfusion leading to syncope and/or angina.\n(Choice A) Ventricular preexcitation usually results in premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).\n(Choice B) Impaired SA node automaticity (sick sinus syndrome) mast often results from fibrosis of the sinus node ar disease of the SA nodal artery. Patients may present with bradycardia, lightheadedness, or syncope. On EKG, this often appears as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (bursts of atrial tachyarrhythmia followed by bradycardia).\n(Choice D) Atrial reentry leads ta atrial tachycardia of abrupt onset and terminatian.\n(Choice E) Bundle branch block occurs below the AY node and impedes ventricular depolarization. The result is a prolonged QRS complex.\nEducational objective:\nSecond degree heart block is identified by prolongation of the PR interval with occasional dropped beats. In Mohitz type I, the PR interval gradually lengthens until a beat is dropped. In type II, the PR intervals are of constant length before the dropped beat. The prognosis is better for Mohitz type I, which is the result of AY node dysfunction."

      "D. High aldosterone/renin ratio",
      "E. Increased 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario demonstrates a patient with advanced atherosclerosis, having atherosclerotic lesions of multiple sites: Coronary atherosclerosis, intermittent claudication, a difference between right arm and left arm BP readings. He also has multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, and hypertension. Resistant hypertension in such a patient should make you suspect atherosclerotic narrowing of renal arteries. Continuous (systolic and diastalic) murmur in the periumbilical area, ar in the flanks, is characteristic of renal artery stenosis; the diastolic component makes this murmur more specific, compared to the systolic component alone. If you carefully auscultate the periumbilical area of such a patient with advanced atherosclerosis and resistant hypertension, you have a good chance ta arrive at a carrect diagnosis.\nThe increased pulsation of intercostal arteries (Choice A) is typical for coarctation of the aorta.\nUrinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid (Choice C) is increased in pheochromocytoma.\nA high aldosterone/renin ratio (Choice D) is characteristic for primary hyperaldosteraonism.\nAn increased 24-hour urinal free cortisol excretion (Choice E) is observed in Cushing's syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nRenal artery stenosis is a common cause of resistant hypertension in a patient with advanced atherosclerosis.

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is having an ST-elevation Ml in the inferiar distribution (leads II, ll, and aVF), likely secondary to an acclusive thrombus. His long-term prognosis is most influenced by the duration of time that lapses befare coranary blood flow is restored. The twa primary options for restaring coronary blood flow are percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (FTCA) and fibrinolysis. FTCA has been shown tao have superiar autcomes compared to fibrinalysis, and should therefore be the chosen reperfusion modality when available. Ideally, FTCA should be done with a \"door-to-balloon” time of less than 90 minutes. When fibrinolytics are used, a \"door-to-needle” time of 30 minutes is the goal.\n(Choice A) Myocardial oxygen demand is determined by heart rate, preload, contractility, and afterload. Medications such as nitrates and beta-blockers affect these parameters and can be used to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. However, these treatments are more effective in angina as opposed to STEMI, as this patient cannot meet much myocardial oxygen demand since there is no coronary blood flow.\n(Choice B) Decreasing blood coagulability with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and/or heparin is part of the management of STEMI. However, these medications only stop the thrombus from progressing. In contrast, FTCA and fibrinolysis disrupt the thrombus that is occluding coranary blood flaw.\n(Choice D) At ane time, lidocaine was recommended as prophylaxis against ischemia-related arrhythmias, but this is no longer the case. Arrhythmias should be treated only as they arise.\n(Choice E) Reperfusion injury can occur after PTCA or fibrinolysis, potentially causing continued myocyte death. However, there are no medications currently available to inhibit this process, and the benefits of reperfusion far autweigh the consequences of reperfusion injury.\nEducational objective:\nThe strongest influence on long-term pragnosis following an ST-elevation myocardial infarction is the duration af time that passes befare coronary blood flow is restored (via FTCA ar fibrinolysis)."

    "answer": "G",
    "explanation": "This patient was admitted to the hospital with chest pain concerning for acute caranary syndrome. Shortly after being started an several medications, he developed shortness of breath and prolonged expirations. While the differential diagnosis for dyspnea is broad, we can take several clues fram the vignette to point us toward the carrect diagnosis. First, the patient has a history of intermittent dyspnea and coughing. Given his histary of eczema, these symptoms may represent mild undiagnosed intermittent asthma.\nMetoprolol is a competitive, beta1-selective adrenergic antaganist, but it can also block beta2 receptars in the bronchial tree. (This beta2 effect is mare prominent at higher doses.) In patients with reactive airway disease, beta2 blockade causes bronchaoconstriction with symptoms like wheezing, cough and prolonged expiration. Thus, while beta1-selective adrenergic blockers are preferred over nonselective agents in patients with asthma and COPD, even these agents should be used with caution as the above vignette demonstrates.\n(Choice A) Post-infarction pericarditis is typically seen 2 to 5 days after a myocardial infarction. Autoimmune pericarditis is seen one to several weeks after an acute myocardial infarction or open-heart surgery.\n(Choice B) Bronchitis is characterized by shortness of breath, productive cough and fever. This patient does not have fever or productive cough, making this diagnosis less likely.\n(Choice C) Recurrent myocardial ischemia would likely manifest with pain, but symptoms like nausea and diaphoresis are sometimes the most prominent. Breathlessness due to acute heart failure can occur secondary to myocardial infarction. While wheezing may be present (\"cardiac asthma\"), crackles and elevated jugular venous pressure would also be expected.\n(Choice D) Inferior wall infarctions may damage the right ventricle and present with hypotension and elevated venous pressure, but wheezing would not be expected.\n(Choice E) Pleural effusions present with dullness on tharacic percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased movement of the ipsilateral chest wall.\n(Choice F) Dyspnea, tachypnea and chest pain, but not wheezing, may be signs of a pulmonary embolism.\nEducational objective:\nMetoprolol is a selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist that, when administered in high doses, can block bronchodilatary beta2 adrenergic receptors causing bronchocanstriction in susceptible individuals."

      "D. Carotid massage",
      "E. Diltiazem"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by lack of organized atrial activity. Hypertension is the mast comman cause. Other causes include valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, and alcohol. AF is identified on EKG by absent P waves, an irregularly irregular rate, and a narrow CRS complex. This patient has AF with rapid ventricular response, as his heart rate is approximately 140 beats/minute. The treatment of AF depends on a number of factors, including whether the patient is hemodynamically stable and the length of time spent in AF. In patients wha are hemodynamically unstable (low BF, altered mental status), immediate cardioversion is indicated. If the patient is hemodynamically stable—as is the case in this vignette—then the duration of AF must be considered. If AF has been present for <=48 haurs, then electrical ar pharmacologic cardioversion is appropriate. If AF has been present >48 hours, there is a high risk of thromboembalism with cardioversion; such patients should be treated with rate control and 3-4 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion is attempted. Rate control is most often achieved with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is the only rate-controlling agent listed above, and is the correct answer (Choice E).\n(Choice A) Atrial fibrillation has been present for >48 hours in this stable patient, making immediate cardioversion inappropriate.\n(Choice B) Lidocaine is a class Ib antiarrhythmic. It is used to treat ventricular tachycardia but not atrial arrhythmias.\n(Choice C & D) Carotid massage and adenosine may be used to manage patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Carotid massage is a vagal maneuver that slows the heart rate and may terminate SVT. Adenosine works in SVT by causing transient AY nade blockade, which allows identification of the rhythm and terminates certain farms of SVT.\nEducational objective:\nAtrial fibrillation is identified an EKG by an irregularly irregular R-R interval with absent FP waves and narrow CRS complexes. In unstable patients, immediate cardioversion should be performed. In stable patients who have been in atrial fibrillation (AF) <48 hours, cardioversion is appropriate. In stable patients in AF >=48 haurs, 3-4 weeks of rate control and anticoagulation should precede cardioversion."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Prolonged, tachysystalic atrial fibrillation causes significant left ventricular (LV) dilation and a depressed ejection fraction. LV dysfunction results from tachycardia, neurohumoral activation, absence of an atrial ‘kick’ (that accounts for up to 25% of LY end-diastolic valume]), and atrial-ventricular desynchronization. Controlling the rhythm in such patients usually improves the LV function significantly {sometimes even dramatically!}.\n(Choice F) Although an underlying disorder like alcoholic cardiomyopathy ar coronary artery disease may account for LY dysfunction in this patient, rhythm control seems ta be the most effective tool in impraving this patient's condition.\n(Choice A, B and D) Freload optimization, decreasing afterload, and inotropic support are less urgent in this case and would be less beneficial without first controlling the rhythm or rate.\n(Choice E) Slight mitral regurgitation is a secondary event explained by LV dilation.\nEducational Objective:\nControlling the rhythm ar rate in patients with prolonged tachysystolic atrial fibrillation usually improves the LV function significantly, sometimes even dramatically."

      "E. Carotid massage"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The abave patient has developed ventricular tachycardia (regular, wide complex tachycardia) but there is no hemodynamic compromise. The patient is alert, awake and oriented ta time, place and person and his potassium level is within normal limits; his BP is stable. The cause of the ventricular tachycardia is due to coranary artery disease. The best treatment for a patient with ventricular tachycardia who has no hemodynamic compromise Is loading with either lidocaine or amiodarone. Either of these 2 agents will aid in the conversion to narmal sinus rhythm. However, amiodarone has become the drug of choice (Choice A).\n(Choice B) In the presence of a ventricular tachycardia, digitalis should never be administered as the arrhythmia can worsen. Digoxin is anly used to treat atrial arrhythmias.\n(Choice C) Cardioversian is an excellent aption for sustained ventricular tachycardia with hemadynamic compromise. The above patient has a stable blood pressure and cardioversion is not indicated. However, the electrode pads should be placed an the anterior and posterior chest walls in case the tachycardia does not revert back to normal sinus rhythm.\n(Choice D) IV Cardizem should not be used for ventricular arrhythmia. It is indicated only for atrial arrhythmias.\n(Choice E) Carotid massage is useful for supraventricular tachycardia (narrow complex) nat for ventricular tachycardia. It has na rale in the management of ventricular tachycardia.\nEducational objective:\n“entricular tachycardia in the presence of a stable blood pressure does nat warrant cardioversion. The best treatment is loading with lidocaine ar amiodarone (drug of choice)."

    "question": "A 48-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office complaining of progressive exertional dyspnea. It has become especially bothersome over the past two months. Presently, he becomes short of breath after climbing one flight of stairs. He denies any significant problems in the past. He is not taking any medications and he denies smoking or drinking alcohol. His temperature is 37.2C (98.9F), pulse is 78/min, blood pressure is 130/75 mm of Hg and respirations are 14/min. Chest examination reveals a harsh systalic murmur that is best heard at the right second intercostal space with radiation along the carotid arteries. An S4 is heard at the apex. Based on these findings, what is the mast likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "B. Myxomatous valve degeneration",
      "C. Rheumatic heart disease",
      "D. Bicuspid aortic valve",
      "E. Senile calcific aortic stenosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient appears to be suffering from congestive heart failure as a consequence of aortic stenosis. A harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the caratid arteries is a classic description of the murmur caused by aortic stenasis. The S4 occurs as the result of left atrial kick against a stiff left ventricle. In aortic stenosis, the high resistance generated by the stenosed aartic valve causes concentric hypertrophy and stiffening of the left ventricle, resulting in the S4. The three most common causes or aortic stenosis in the general population are senile calcific aortic stenosis, bicuspid aartic valve, and rheumatic heart disease. The most impartant hint to the underlying etiology of this patient's aortic stenosis is his relatively young age. A bicuspid aortic valve is the cause of aortic stenosis in the majority of patients under 70 years old, so this is the most likely cause of this patient's aortic stenosis.\n(Choice A) The murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be easily confused with that of aortic stenosis. Both entities can cause a systalic crescendo-decrescendo murmur and an S4. However, the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually best appreciated in the lower left sternal border and it does not typically radiate ta the carotids.\n(Choice B) Myxomatous valve degeneration is the typical pathologic entity that causes mitral valve prolapse.\n(Choice C) As mentioned above, rheumatic heart disease can be a cause of aortic stenosis. However itis a much less common cause than either senile calcific aortic stenasis or a bicuspid aortic valve.\n(Choice E) Senile calcific aortic stenosis is the most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients who are alder than 70 years old. As people age, the aortic valve can accumulate calcium, causing stenosis.\nEducational objective:\nThe three most common causes of aortic stenosis in the general population are senile calcific aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve, and rheumatic heart disease. A bicuspid aortic valve is the cause of aortic stenosis in the majority of patients under 70 years old."

    "question": "A 47-year-old Caucasian female presents with occasional episodes of nocturnal substernal chest pain that wakes her up during sleep. The pain episodes last 15-20 minutes and resolve spontaneously. She denies any illicit drug use. She leads a sedentary lifestyle but states that she can climb twa flights of stairs without any discomfort. She has no history of hypertension or diabetes. Her pulse is 75/min and regular, blood pressure is 134/70 mmHg and respirations are 14/min. Extended ambulatory ECG monitoring reveals transient ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL, and V4-V6 during the episodes. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",

      "F. Simvastatin",
      "G. Heparin",
      "H. Streptokinase"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has variant angina (ar Prinzmetal’s angina), which causes chest pain by coronary vasospasm. It typically occurs in young females, and the greatest risk factor for variant angina is smoking. Aside from smoking, affected patients often lack cardiovascular risk factors. The episodes characteristically occur at night (fram midnight to 8 am) and can be associated with transient ST elevations an ECG. The treatment of this condition invalves elimination of risk factors such as smoking, as well as pharmacologic therapy with calcium channel blockers ar nitrates. These medications work in variant angina by promoting vasodilation and preventing vasocanstriction.\n(Choice B) Monselective B-Blockers such as propranolol should be avoided in variant angina because B2 receptor inhibition can lead to worsened coronary vasospasm.\n(Choice C) Aspirin should also be avoided in variant angina because it causes prostacyclin inhibition, which may promote coronary vasospasm.\n(Choices D & F) Patients with variant angina often lack cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperchalesteralemia. Inthe absence of lipid abnormalities, variant angina management does not entail cholesterol lowering medications. If this patient's lipids were found to be abnormal on a screening test, then lipid-lowering medications could be considered.\n(Choice E) Digoxin is typically used to increase contractility in patients with congestive heart failure or as a rate control agent in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter, none of which are a problem for this patient.\n(Choice G) Heparin is an anticoagulant. Vasospasm—and not the coagulation cascade—is the cause of variant angina. Heparin plays no role in the management of uncomplicated variant angina.\n(Choice H) Streptokinase is used for thrombolysis in the treatment of a STEMI if percutaneous caranary intervention is nat rapidly available. However, this patient's presentation is more consistent with variant angina than myocardial infarction.\nEducational objective:\nPharmacologic management of variant angina invalves calcium channel blockers and/or nitrates to prevent coranary vasoconstriction. Monselective B-Blackers and aspirin should be avoided because they can promote vasocanstriction."

    "question": "A 36-year-old male patient, who has a history of Marfan's syndrome, presents with sudden onset of severe central tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain is 9/10 in severity and is unrelated to exertion. He denies any history of alcohol or tobacco use. Measurement of his BP shows a difference of 35 mm Hg between his two arms. Chest auscultation reveals clear lung sounds and a mid-systolic click. What is the mast appropriate next diagnostic step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transesophageal echocardiography",
      "B. Transthoracic echocardiogram",
      "C. Cardiac enzymes",
      "D. Coronary angiogram",
      "E. Ventilation-perfusion scan"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering fram acute aortic dissection, for which transesophageal echocardiography ar computed tomagraphy of the chest are the diagnostic studies of choice. The collagen abnormalities of Marfan's syndrome predispose patients to both aortic dissection and mitral valve prolapse (as evidenced by the mid-systaolic click on the patient's cardiac exam). Tearing pain with radiation to the back and a difference in BF of greater than 30 mm Hg between the twa arms are important clinical clues to the presence af aartic dissection.\n(Choice B) TEE, CT and MRI are much mare sensitive than TTE for the diagnosis of aortic dissection. The distal ascending, transverse and descending aorta cannot be adequately visualized with TTE.\n(Choice C) Cardiac enzymes are crucial to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and it is reasonable to draw them on almost any patient with chest pain. However, this patient's age, symptoms and history of Marfan's make aortic dissection mare likely than myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, TEE is the most appropriate next step.\n(Choice D) Coronary angiography is typically performed as quickly as possible in patients with an ST elevation MI and within the first 48 hours in patients with unstable Angina/NSTEMI. As discussed above, Ml is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient. Even if there were a high suspicion far MI, ECG and cardiac enzymes should precede caronary angiography.\n(Choice E) A ventilation/perfusion scan is indicated when pulmanary embolism is suspected. Pulmonary embolism (PE) belongs in the differential for life threatening causes of chest pain. However, the chest pain of PE is typically pleuritic in nature; tearing pain with radiation to the back and a BF differential between the arms is far mare suggestive of aortic dissection.\nEducational objective:\nTearing pain with radiation to the back and a difference in BF of greater than 30 mm Hg between the arms are impartant clinical clues for aortic dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography or CT with contrast are the two diagnostic studies of choice for suspected aortic dissection."

    "question": "A 55-year-old male presents to your office with a 6-month history of periodic substernal pressure. He experiences this pressure while walking uphill or climbing twa flights of stairs. His past medical history is insignificant. He smokes 1 pack a day and consumes alcohol occasionally. His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg and heart rate is 75/min. Resting ECG is normal. You suspect stable angina and order an ECG stress test that reveals horizontal ST segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF at submaximal heart rate. What is the best medication to treat this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Isosorbide dinitrate",
      "B. Verapamil",

      "H. Clonidine"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with typical exertional angina canfirmed with ECG stress testing. Another impartant finding in this patient is hypertension. A beta-blocker is probably the best initial treatment for this patient, because it would increase the threshold far the development of an anginal episode and control the hypertension. Besides that, it is believed that beta-blockers are cardioprotective; they can potentially reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and arrhythmic episodes by decreasing the sympathetic output to the heart.\nCalcium antagonists (Choices B and C) are considered if beta-blockers are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.\nNitrates (Choice A) can cantrol anginal episodes, but they are nat good antihypertensive agents. If the effect af a beta-blocker is not satisfactory, a nitrate can be added ta the regimen.\nEnalapril (Choice E) is an antihypertensive agent without anti-anginal activity. There is some evidence that ACE inhibitors may decrease the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic heart disease not anly by lowering blood pressure, but also affecting the development of atherosclerotic plague, but this evidence is controversial.\nEducational Objective:\nIn patients who present with stable angina and hypertension, a beta-blocker is the drug of choice."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of dyspnea, fatigue, poor appetite and weight gain aver the past several weeks. He says that about four weeks ago he began to develop worsening shortness of breath with exertion and mare recently has been waking at night with breathlessness. He also notes that it is sometimes difficult for him to open his eyes in the morning due to facial edema. He has no significant past medical history and he takes no medications. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 200/120 mmHg and his heart rate is 100/min. You note generalized bodily edema and distention of his jugular veins while he is sitting upright. On lung auscultation you hear bibasilar rales. Urinalysis shows trace protein, no nitrites, trace leukocyte esterase, 50+ red blood cells and occasional neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's edema?",
    "options": [
      "A. Renal hypoperfusion",
      "B. Hypoalbuminemia",
      "C. Extensive glomerular damage",
      "D. Portal hypertension",
      "E. Hypothyroidism",
      "F. Right ventricular failure"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Peripheral edema can result fram a number of etiologies including argan failure (cardiac, hepatic, ar renal}, hypoalbuminemia (secondary to nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, ar liver disease), and venous insufficiency. The patient described above has anasarca, or generalized edema, characterized by pulmanary edema and ascites in addition to swollen extremities. Organ failure and/or hypoalbuminemia are potential causes of anasarca. Based on the information presented in the vignette, acute glomerulonephritis appears to be the unifying diagnosis here. In glomerulonephritis, edema results from glomerular damage and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nIn glamerulonephritis, the urine sediment will reveal red blood cells, red blood cell casts, and might contain white blood cells and protein as well. Patients may have significant proteinuria, which contributes to their edema. (This patient has anly trace protein on his urinalysis meaning that the majarity of his edema is secondary to a decreased GFR) Decreased GFR is the cause of edema in patients with end-stage renal disease as well.\n(Choice A) Renal hypoperfusion can occur in heart failure (decreased cardiac output), which in turn promotes increased renal sodium reabsorption and edema. Urinalysis would not show significant red blood cells ar casts.\n(Choice B) Hypoalbuminemia can result from excessive albumin loss (as in nephratic syndrome) or decreased albumin synthesis (as in cirrhosis ar severe malnutrition). While this patient clearly has renal disease, he does not have significant proteinuria to explain his presentation.\n(Choice D) Cirrhosis can cause portal hypertension as the scarred liver limits blood flow through the sinusoidal network. Patients with cirrhosis typically have ascites out of propartion to edema in other tissues, plus other signs of chranic liver disease like spider angiomata, palmar erythema, and caput medusa.\n(Choice E) While hypothyroidism can cause pretibial edema, it is not a commaon cause of anasarca.\n(Choice F) Right ventricular failure {often a consequence of left ventricular failure) is a frequent cause of peripheral edema. It manifests with an elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Of nate, isolated right ventricular failure will not cause pulmonary edema because it does not cause blood to pool in the pulmanary capillary beds.\nEducational objective:\nAnasarca typically results from organ failure ar hypoalbuminemia. In patients with glomerulonephritis, edema results from the decreased glomerular filtration rate as well as proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia in some Cases."

    "question": "A 45-year-old white male presents to the ER after an episode of syncope. His medical history is unremarkable except far an upper respiratory infection ane week ago. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 90/min, blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and respirations are 13/min. His neck veins are distended and his heart sounds are distant. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Chest x-ray reveals small bilateral pleural effusions and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following EKG findings is fairly specific for his condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Prolonged 'PR' interval",
      "B. Presence of 'F' waves",
      "C. Electrical alternans",
      "D. Presence of 'delta’ wave",
      "E. Mew-onset right bundle branch black"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has a pericardial effusion, which often causes electrical alternans on EKG. His recent upper respiratory infection is a clue towards the diagnosis, as pericardial effusions are often secondary to viral pericarditis. Accompanying pleural effusions may be found as well.\nElectrical alternans describes QRS complexes whose amplitudes vary from beat to beat on EKG. tis thought to result fram the heart's swinging back and forth within an increased quantity of pericardial fluid. Jugular venous distention, muffled heart sounds and borderline blood pressure indicate developing cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography can confirm the presence of pericardial effusion.\n(Choice A) The PR’ interval is prolonged in first degree heart block, a condition that is usually asymptomatic and requires na treatment.\n(Choice B) The presence of 'F' waves, ar flutter waves, is diagnastic of atrial flutter. Jugular venous distention and hypotension can develop if the heart rate is rapid enough, but this patient's rate is only 90.\n(Choice D) A ‘delta’ wave is an upsloping just before the QRS complex that occurs in patients with an accessory conduction pathway, like in Walf-Parkinsan-VWhite syndrome. It is not associated with pericardial effusion.\n(Choice E) Mew-onset right bundle branch block can sometimes be seen in pulmonary embolism. Pulmanary embali usually cause tachypnea and/or tachycardia.\nExplanation:\nElectrical alternans is when the amplitudes of the QRS complexes vary from beat to beat. It is fairly specific far pericardial effusion. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette can be seen an chest x-ray as well. Echocardiogram can more definitely demanstrate a pericardial effusion."

      "F. Verapamil",
      "G. Aminophylline",
      "H. Mitroglycerin"
    ],
    "answer": "H",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the setting of long-standing hypertension and a pulmanary exam cancerning for cardiogenic pulmonary edema. He has likely developed diastolic dysfunction (impaired ventricular relaxation) fram his long-standing hypertensian and is now in left ventricular failure. Mitroglycerin (MTG), either IV, sublingual, or topical, relieves the dyspnea and tachycardia associated with cardiogenic pulmanary edema by rapidly reducing preload. Several studies have suggested that it warks quicker than marphine ar loop diuretics. NTG is not part of the long-term management for patients with heart failure but can be beneficial in acutely alleviating symptoms. It should be used cautiously in patients with hypotension. Beyond NTG, loop diuretics are the mainstay of therapy for decompensated heart failure and principally wark by reducing total body volume.\n(Choice A) Beta-blockers are tremendously efficacious in treating chronic heart failure, and have been shown to significantly improve long-term morbidity and mortality in affected patients. However, beta-blockers are negative inotropes and may acutely worsen heart failure symptoms.\n(Choice B) Hydralazine given in combination with an aral nitrate has proven efficacy for treating African American men with heart failure. However, hydralazine given alone will not alleviate symptoms as quickly as NTG.\n(Choice C) Salmeterol is a long-acting B2-adrenergic agonist used in the chronic treatment of asthma and bronchodilator-responsive COPD. Because it has a slow onset, salmeterol is not beneficial in the treatment af asthma or COPD exacerbations. Regardless, this patient's wheezing is due to pulmonary edema, not asthma, sa salmeteral is not the appropriate therapy here.\n(Choice D) At moderate doses (3-10 mcg/kg/min), dopamine stimulates myocardial B-receptors and increases myocardial contractility. However, at these doses, dopamine is also arrhythmogenic and may worsen heart failure.\n(Choice E) Amiodarone can be used to treat atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in patients with heart failure but it is not a treatment for pulmonary edema.\n(Choice F) Verapamil can be used far rate contral in atrial fibrillation and to improve diastolic relaxation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, it is also a negative inotrape and may acutely worsen heart failure symptoms.\n(Choice G) Aminophylline is a bronchodilator used ta treat asthma and COPD. It is not typically recommended in heart failure.\nEducational objective:\nCardiogenic pulmanary edema results from left heart failure and is characterized by crackles on pulmonary exam. Mitroglycerin is the most rapidly acting medication ta relieve the symptoms of pulmonary edema."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In an arterial pressure diagram, the peaks correspond to systolic pressures and the valleys to diastolic pressures. We can see that in this patient, the diastolic pressure remains relatively constant throughout the tracing, but systolic pressures drop substantially with each inspiration. Some drop in systalic pressure (<=10 mm Hg) during inspiration is normal. This physiologic drop is the result of increased venous return ta the right heart during inspiration, which impedes left ventricular filling and thus causes a drap in systalic pressure. Pulsus paradoxus is the term far an abnormally large drop in systolic blood pressure (>=12 mm Hg) with inspiration. Itis seen in some forms of cardiac disease (tamponade, pericardial effusion) and pulmanary disease (tension pneumatharax, severe asthma). In asthma, significantly elevated intrathoracic pressures during inhalation are thought to exacerbate compression of the left ventricle, causing pulsus paradoxus.\n(Choice B to E) None of these conditions typically cause pulsus paradoxus.\nEducational objective:\nPulsus paradoxus is defined as a difference in systolic blood pressure of >=12 mm Hg during inspiration. Causes include cardiac tamponade, tension pneumotharax, and severe asthma."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has a pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade. On chest x-ray, a large pericardial effusion may appear as an enlarged, globular-appearing cardiac shadow (the characteristic \"water bottle\" heart shape), as seen an this patient's chest x-ray. Due to the increased fluid in the pericardial space, physical exam will reveal distant heart sounds and a non-palpable pulse at the cardiac apex or paint of maximal impulse.\nIt is important to recognize that this patient does nat have cardiac tamponade. Tamponade presents as hypotension, right heart failure (distended jugular veins), and tachycardia. Fulsus paradoxus may be present. The therapy for cardiac tamponade is vigorous volume resuscitation and pericardiocentesis.\n(Choice A) &n audible fourth heart sound is heard in normal, young patients and in people with left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient's chest x-ray is more cansistent with a pericardial effusion than left ventricular hypertrophy, which often appears as a \"boot-shaped\" cardiac shadow on x-ray.\n(Choice C) Pulsus bisferiens, ar biphasic pulse, refers to two strong systolic impulses with a midsystalic dip. It can be seen in aortic regurgitation with or without aortic stenosis and in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.\n(Choice D) An opening snap is heard with mitral stenosis. Significant mitral stenosis will cause left atrial enlargement. This will be seen on chest x-ray as a straightening of the left part of the cardiac silhouette {as apposed to the normal mild concavity visible below the pulmanary artery shadow). Enlargement of the entire cardiac silhouette would not be seen.\n(Choice E) Fixed splitting of the second heart sound is associated with atrial septal defects.\n(Choice F) Intermittent ptosis wauld be seen if this patient had myasthenia gravis in assaciation with thymoma. These tumars present as anterior mediastinal masses on chest x-ray with preserved cardiac size. This chest x-ray is not consistent with a thymoma.\nEducational Objective:\nPericardial effusions will appear as an enlarged, \"water bottle\" shaped cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. Physical exam findings of pericardial effusions without cardiac tamponade include diminished heart sounds on auscultation and a difficult to palpate point of maximal impulse."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has had multiple blood pressure readings greater than 140/90 aver a period of manths, and therefore meets the criteria for stage I hypertension. In such patients, it is reasonable ta enact a trial of lifestyle madifications to reduce blood pressure before resorting to medications. The most effective lifestyle intervention for reducing blood pressure is decreased consumption of alcohol. It is recommended that males consume less than 2 drinks daily, and women less than 1.\n(Choice A) There is no question that smoking cessation reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. However, in terms of improving hypertension itself, abstinence from alcohal has a greater effect.\n(Choice B) Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whale grains have been shown to aid weight loss and may therefare indirectly help lower blood pressure. Decreasing alcohal consumption would be expected to have a mare dramatic effect, however.\n(Choice C) Patients with a low dietary intake of calcium do have a higher risk of developing hypertension, but qiving these patients calcium supplements has not been shawn to substantially impact blood pressure.\n(Choice E) Vegetarians tend to have less hypertension than meat-eaters, but there is not strong data to suggest that eliminating animal protein from the diet is an effective means of controlling hypertension.\nEducational objective:\nLifestyle modification should be the first-line intervention for newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertension. Reduction of alcohol and sodium intake, weight loss, and aerobic exercise can all decrease blood pressure.

      "E. Superior vena cava syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's coal, dusky fingertips are the result of norepinephrine-induced vasospasm. Morepinephrine has alpha-1 agonist properties which cause vasoconstriction; this property is useful when trying to increase the blood pressure of hypotensive patients. However, in some patients with decreased blood flaw, vasocanstriction can result in ischemia and necrasis of the distal fingers and toes. A similar phenomenan can occur in the intestines (resulting in mesenteric ischemia) or kidney (causing renal failure).\n(Choice A) Endocarditis can spread septic embali throughout the body, but would not be expected to affect all fingers.\n(Choice B) Raynaud's phenomenon is a cause of finger ischemia that typically progresses from pallor to cyanosis to erythema. It can be accompanied by pain and is usually due to cold exposure ar stress. The duskiness of the fingers pictured above, hawever is more suggestive of ischemia.\n(Choice D) Cholesterol embali can occur in patients with atherosclerosis and can affect the distal portions of the digits, thus its occasional name \"blue toe syndrome \" However, symmetrical involvement of all digits would be unusual.\n(Choice E) Superior vena cava syndrome occurs in patients with lung cancer, thrombi, ar fibrosing mediastinitis and can cause upper extremity edema. However, arterial flow is preserved and so ischemia does not occur.\nEducational objective:\nFressaors such as norepinephrine can cause ischemia of the distal fingers and toes secondary to vasospasm. The diagnosis is suggested by symmetric duskiness and coolness af all fingertips."

    "question": "A 14-year-old African American male collapses and dies while playing basketball at a school tournament. He has no known past medical histary. Which of the following is the mast likely underlying disease in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "B. Coronary atherosclerosis",
      "C. Aortic aneurysm rupture",
      "D. Ventricular septal defect",
      "E. Bicuspid aorta"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Sudden cardiac death in a young individual, especially during exertion, is most common with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is mare camman in African-Americans than whites. Mast of the patients who die suddenly from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have had no prior symptoms. Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can occur in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The generation of these arrhythmias is multifactorial, but all derive from the underlying abnormality of abnormal myocytes and myocardial scarring. Death can also occur in these patients fram heart failure and stroke as well, but these would be unlikely to cause such a sudden death.\n(Answer B) Coronary atherosclerosis can lead to myocardial infarction, which can produce the sudden anset af ventricular arrhythmias resulting in death. However, the extremely young age and lack of any significant past medical history make this unlikely for this patient.\n(Answer C) Aartic aneurysms in a patient of this age are rare. In the general population, they are usually due to atherosclerosis, which this patient would be unlikely to have.\n(Answer D) Ventricular septal defects are often a congenital disorder and would be possible in this patient. However, they are not a cause of sudden death. If the patient were ta die from complications of a ventricular septal defect, he would likely have some symptoms beforehand.\n(Answer E) A bicuspid aorta is a congenital condition that can lead to aortic stenosis. However, patients typically have symptoms of the condition and they usually develop at a later age. Bicuspid aortic valve would therefore be an unlikely cause of sudden death in this patient.\nEducational objective:\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy can lead to ventricular arrhythmias, and should be suspected in a sudden death af an atherwise healthy young individual."

    "question": "A 63-year-old female presents to your office for a routine check-up. She has no present complaints. Her past medical history includes DM, type 2, and hypertension. Her current medications include glyburide and atenolol. She does not smake. She drinks 2-3 glasses of wine 1-2 times a week. Three consecutive BP measurements were in the range of 138-142/87-90 mmHg. Physical examination is within normal limits. Her recent fasting glucose level was 250 mg/dL. ECG recorded 1 month ago showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Which statement about the BP control in this patient is the most accurate?",
    "options": [
      "A. BP is within acceptable range",
      "B. BP is within optimal range",
      "C. It is better to keep systolic pressure less than 130 mmHg to slow end-organ damage",
      "D. Diastolic BF is within acceptable range, but systolic is not",
      "E. Systolic BP is within acceptable range, but diastolic is not"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Traditionally a goal, blood pressure is considered to be below 140/90 mmHg. But it is recently recognized that BP needs more tight contral in diabetics and patients with chranic renal failure. These two groups of patients are especially sensitive to high BP, that's why the values of systolic BF for these patients should be kept lower than 130 mmHg and diastolic BF lower than 80 mmHg to prevent end argan damage.\nBlood pressure could be considered in acceptable range (Choice A) if the patient was not diabetic. According to JNC-7 report (JNC stands far Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) BF is considered optimal when it is below 120/80 mmHg (Choice B) In this patient both systolic (Choice E) and diastolic (Choice D) BFP are above the goal values.\nEducational objective:\nIt is better to keep systolic pressure <= 130 mmHg to slow end-organ damage in patients with diabetes and chronic renal failure."

    "question": "A 70-year-old patient presents ta the ER with a 3-hour history of intensive retrosternal chest pain that radiates to the interscapular area. He states that he has never experienced this pain before. His past medical history is significant for a 20-year history of hypertension and a 10-year histary of diabetes mellitus, type 2. His current medications include enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. He does not smoke ar consume alcohol. His vital signs are: BP 180/110 mm Hg in the right arm and 178/110 mm Hg in the left arm, PR 85/min and RR 18/min. The physical examination revealed an early decrescendo-type diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. The EKG is normal. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Magnetic resonance imaging",
      "B. Transesophageal echocardiography",
      "C. Aartography",
      "D. CK. MB and troponin T levels",
      "E. Ventilation/perfusion scanning"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described in this scenario mast probably has aartic dissection. Intensive retrosternal pain that radiates to the back of the chest, along with a normal EKG strongly suggests aartic dissection. Another important clue is the presence of the early diastolic murmur, characteristic of aortic regurgitation. Dissection af the ascending aorta may lead to acute aortic regurgitation. Hypertension is an impartant risk factor and blood pressure should be measured in both arms (there may be a difference in inter-arm blood pressure readings due to dissection). Although an aortogram was recommended as the most reliable diagnostic toal in diagnosing aortic dissection a decade ago (Choice C) non-invasive methods have gained popularity more recently. The sensitivity and specificity of the MRI, CT and transesophageal echocardiography in diagnosing aartic dissection exceeds 90%. Transesophageal echocardiography is usually preferred to an MRI (Choice A) because the latter is time-consuming.\nCardiac troponins (Choice D) are the markers of myocardial injury. They are used in patients with acute coronary syndromes. This patient has no EKG changes, and the pain is not typical of acute coronary syndrome.\nYentilation/perfusion scanning (Choice E) is used in patients with suspected thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery. In that case, the patient would also be tachypneic, tachycardic and hypotensive.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect aortic dissection in a patient with acute retrosternal pain and a narmal EKG. Check blood pressure in both arms and auscultate for diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography is the preferred diagnostic tool. Before performing the TEE, HTN should be controlled."

      "E. High portal venous resistance",
      "F. Decreased plasma colloid pressure"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has ischemic heart disease, cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, elevated venous pressure, and peripheral edema, all findings cansistent with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF). In heart failure, there is a decrease in the effective circulating blood volume, leading to renal hypoperfusion. Due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the kidney's arterioles constrict (both afferent and efferent) and sodium reabsarption is enhanced. These changes increase water retention and elevate the total body volume, further exacerbating the CHF.\n(Choice B) In CHF, there is a decrease in sodium delivery to the distal tubule due to both decreased renal perfusion and increased sodium retention mare proximally in the kidney.\n(Choice C) In CHF, renal perfusion is decreased, nat increased.\n(Choice D) Sodium is the principle electralyte responsible far edema. Potassium does not play a significant rale in the development of edema.\n(Choice E) Fartal hypertension is the hallmark of cirrhosis. This patient does not have significant risk factors far cirrhosis (e.g. alcoholism, hepatitis C) and does not have other stigmata of chronic liver disease like spider angiomata, palmar erythema, or caput medusa.\n(Choice F) Hypoalbuminemia is the leading cause of decreased plasma calloid pressure. Low serum albumin concentrations typically result from nephratic range proteinuria ar poar albumin synthesis. This patient's presentation is mare cansistent with congestive heart failure than hypoalbuminemia.\nEducational objective:\nEdema in congestive heart failure is due to both mechanical impedance to fluid remaval and increased renal sodium retention."

The first episode occurred about one year ago when her roommate committed suicide and then several similar episodes occurred usually provaked by a strong emation. The episodes are preceded by lightheadedness, weakness, and blurred vision and last about three minutes with rapid recovery of consciousness. Past medical history is insignificant. She is not taking any medications and denies drug abuse. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg while supine and 108/70 mmHg while standing. Physical findings are within normal limits.

      "C. Electroencephalogram",
      "D. Invasive electrophysialogic testing",
      "E. Upright tilt table testing"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The most probable cause of this patient's episodes is vasovagal syncope (common faint). This is also known as neurally mediated or neurocardiogenic syncope. The clinical scenario described is very typical far this condition including prodrome (lightheadedness, weakness, and blurred vision), provacation by an emational situation, and rapid recovery of consciousness. Vasovagal syncope is frequently recurrent. In this case, upright tilt table testing with or without pharmacologic provocation (isoproterenal) may be indicated to confirm the diagnosis.\n24-hour manitaring (Choice B) or invasive electraphysialogic testing (Choice D) are indicated when arrhythmia is suspected as a cause of syncope. This is usually the case in patients with caranary artery disease and underlying cardiac disease.\nEchocardiography (Choice A) can confirm the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyapathy or acquired valvular defects. Generally, if history and physical examination are not indicative of a cardiac disease, the probability af cardiogenic syncope is low.\nEEG (Choice C) is used when seizure is suspected as a cause of syncope. The scenario described is not characteristic for seizure, e.g, presyncopal prodrome and rapid recovery of consciousness.\nEducational Objective:\n“Yasavangal syncope is the mast common cause of syncope. It is frequently recurrent. Upright tilt table testing may be indicated to confirm the diagnasis if the syncope is recurrent."

      "D. Systolic murmur that increases when the patient stands up",
      "E. Paradaxical splitting of S2"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has bacterial endocarditis affecting the tricuspid valve based an the following evidence: He has fever, weakness, and cough; there is physical exam evidence of intravenous drug abuse; and his chest X-ray is concerning for septic embali from the tricuspid valve. Septic pulmanary embali typically cause cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis and produce numerous round alvealar infiltrates on chest X-ray. This patient's proteinuria is likely the result of septic emboli to the kidneys or immune-complex deposition. IV drug users are at increased risk for bacterial endocarditis invalving the right-sided heart valves. Tricuspid regurgitation is comman in individuals with endocarditis of the tricuspid valve, and causes a systalic murmur that increases an inspiration.\n(Choice A) A fourth heart sound (S4) audible with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position is suggestive af hypertensive cardiomyopathy. An audible S4 can be a normal finding in children and young adults.\n(Choice C) Aortic regurgitation produces a diastolic murmur that is best heard when the patient sits up. While the aortic valve is a comman site of infective endocarditis in both IV drug users and nan-drug users, it would not explain the septic pulmanary emboli seen here an chest x-ray.\n(Choice D) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyapathy (HOCM) produces a systolic murmur that increases an standing. HOCM is not associated with endocarditis.\n(Choice E) Paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound (S2) occurs in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) due to delayed closure of the aortic valve. LBBB is not strongly associated with endocarditis.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients who abuse IV drugs are at increased risk for subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) of both the right and left heart. If the tricuspid ar pulmanic valve is affected, SBE can present with embalic phenomena ta the lung. SBE must be in the differential for all IV drug abusers presenting with fever and malaise."

She says that the pain is left-sided, does nat change with deep inspiration, and typically lasts several hours. The pain has no relation to physical activity, but worsens with emational stress. The patient has no significant family history, and does nat use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. She takes no medications and has na drug allergies. On exam, her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and her heart rate is 78/min. ECG is normal. Which of the following is the best next step in her management?",

      "E. Chest X-ray",
      "F. Reassurance"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "There are several methods for determining a patient's risk of coronary artery disease, ranging fram epidemiological models like the Framingham 10-year risk score to stress testing. These methods are most helpful for individuals at intermediate risk for coronary artery disease. This is because a negative nan-invasive evaluation for coronary artery disease in a high risk patient is likely to be a false negative, whereas a positive test in a low risk patient is likely ta be a false positive. Test results are mast likely to change the management of intermediate risk patients. The patient described is at low risk far coronary artery disease. She does not have risk factors like male gender, family history, or smoking. Mareover, her chest pain would be unusual for angina, especially given that it is unrelated to activity and lasts for hours. The etiology of her chest pain most likely has a psychosocial cause, and she should be reassured with regards to her cardiac health.\n(Choices A and B) This patient is at low risk for coronary disease and does not need a stress test.\n(Choice C) A transthoracic echocardiogram can assess cardiac ischemia by detecting wall motion abnormalities during stress. As described above, this patient is at low risk for cardiac disease.\n(Choice D) Given her normal heart rate, nan-pleuritic pain, and lack of dyspnea, this patient is unlikely to have a pulmonary embolism. Moreover, a helical chest CT would be a better study to detect a PE than ultrasonography.\n(Choice E) A chest x-ray is indicated if the patient's story raises concerns for infection, a primary lung process, broken ribs, or pneumaperitoneum. As described above, this patient's chest pain is most likely psychosacial in origin.\nEducational Objective:\nThe differential diagnosis for chest pain is broad and varies significantly depending upon a patient's age and risk factors. In young women, anxiety and other psychosocial factors are a common cause af chest pain."

He suffered an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction one month ago. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in his lower chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a pansystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla. ECG shows previously present unchanged Q waves and a persistent ST segment elevation in the anterior leads. Based an these findings, what is the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms?",

      "G. Aortic dissection",
      "H. Acute pericarditis",
      "I. Ventricular aneurysm"
    ],
    "answer": "I",
    "explanation": "“Ventricular aneurysm is a complication that may occur days to months after myocardial infarction. Camman consequences of ventricular aneurysms include symptoms of CHF | ventricular arrhythmias, mitral regurgitation, and/or thrombus formation. This patient's physical exam finding of a pansystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla is suggestive of mitral regurgitation, the result of aneurysmal alterations of the ventricular geometry. Persistent ST elevations are often seen on ECG in ventricular aneurysm. Echocardiography demonstrating dyskinetic wall motion of a portion of the left ventricle may be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Interventricular wall rupture typically occurs around & days after infarction and causes an acute left-to-right shunt with right sided heart failure and new-onset systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border.\n(Choice B) Ventricular free wall rupture typically occurs around 5 days after myocardial infarction and causes acute pericardial tamponade and rapid decompensation with pulseless electrical activity.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary infarction secondary to pulmonary embolism can cause dyspnea, but it should not cause new anset mitral regurgitation or ST elevations on ECG.\n(Choice D) Recurrent ischemia is a consideration, given the ST elevations on ECG. However, it appears that the ST elevations and Q waves are unchanged since the initial infarction. These findings are more consistent with ventricular aneurysm.\n(Choice E) Right ventricular infarction can occur with inferior wall MI, but usually not with anterior wall MI. Since LV function is relatively preserved in RY infarction, crackles would not be expected on lung exam.\n(Choice F) Papillary muscle rupture typically accurs 3-7 days after an infarct and can cause severe acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema. It does not typically cause persistent ST elevations an ECG.\n(Choice H) Acute pericarditis can occur in the first several days after infarction, while Dressler's syndrome is an immune-mediated pericarditis that can occur weeks to manths after infarction. Diffuse ST elevations are typically present on ECG, and positional chest pain is usually the primary complaint.\nEducational objective:\nVentricular aneurysm is a late complication of myocardial infarction characterized by persistent ST elevations an ECG. Patients may have CHF, ventricular arrhythmias, and/or thrombus farmation along with mitral regurgitation."

    "question": "A 65-year-old male presents to your office with a six-month history of periodic substernal pain. The pain episodes are experienced during strong emotion, last for 10-15 minutes, and resolve spontaneously. He has a long history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type 2. His right foot was amputated two years ago due to diabetes-related complications. You suspect angina pectoris and decide to perform myacardial perfusion scanning. It reveals uniform distribution of isotope at rest, but inhomogenesity of the distribution after dipyridamale injection. You conclude that the patient has ischemic heart disease. Which of the following effects of dipyridamole helped you in making the diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increased heart contractility",
      "B. Coronary steal",
      "C. Dilation of diseased vessels",
      "D. Inhibition of platelet aggregation",
      "E. Placebo effect"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The histary is suggestive of angina pectoris in this patient (episodes of substernal pain provoked by emation). Exercise testing is not possible, because this patient's activity is limited by amputation. Myocardial perfusion scanning can be employed instead using dipyridamole ta reveal the areas of restricted myocardial perfusion.\nDipyridamole and adenosine are coronary vasodilators. Infusion of these substances in patients without coranary artery disease, increases caranary blood flow three to five times above the baseline levels. However, in patients with caranary artery disease, the diseased vessels distal to the obstruction are already maximally dilated (Choice C), and their ability to increase myocardial perfusion is limited; therefore, redistribution of caranary blood flow to 'non-diseased’ areas occurs, and the perfusion of 'diseased' segments diminishes. This phenomenon demanstrated by dipyridamale is called coronary steal and is used to diagnose ischemic heart disease.\nDipyridamaole is a patent antiplatelet aggregate (Choice D), but this property is not employed to assist in diagnosis. Increased cardiac contractility (Choice A) can occur as the result of vasodilatation, butitis a secondary phenomenan. Placebo effect (Choice E) is irrelevant in this case.\nEducational Objective:\nDipyridamaole can be used during myocardial perfusion scanning to reveal the areas of restricted myocardial perfusion. The redistribution of the coronary blood flow to 'non-diseased' segments induced by this drug is called coronary steal phenomenon."

    "options": [
      "A. Digoxin",
      "B. Lidocaine",
      "C. Order potassium levels",
      "D. Complete electrophysiological study",
      "E. Observation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The diagnosis of atrial premature beats depends upan the recagnition of 'P' waves that are premature relative to sinus cycle length and which differ in morphology fram sinus 'P' waves. Atrial premature beats frequently reset the sinus node, producing pauses, which are only partially compensatory. The QRS width is normal.\nPremature atrial beats may be completely normal ar due to anxiety, CHF, hypoxia, caffeine or electrolyte abnormalities. Premature atrial beats never require any treatment and are completely benign (Option E).\n(Option A): Digoxin is a classic inotrope, which is frequently used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias, especially fibrillation. It increases the AY nodal refractoriness and thereby slows the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and flutter. Digoxin is particularly used in patients with heart failure {systolic dysfunction) and atrial fibrillation/flutter. Digoxin has na role in the management of premature atrial beats.\n(Option B): Lidocaine is a class 1 anti arrhythmic agent used in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. It has na role in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias. The drug is usually given intravenously.\n(Option C): Rarely premature atrial beats may be due to electrolyte abnormalities. In such cases, levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium may need to be evaluated. Removing the causative agent or replacing the deficient electrolyte can treat premature atrial beats. Electrolyte abnormalities are unlikely in a healthy patient without comorbid illnesses.\n(Option D): Electrophysiological study can establish whether an anomalous pathway is present or absent and allow its localization. Premature atrial beats do not have an anatomical disturbance and EF studies are not helpful at all.\nEducational objective:\nPremature atrial beats are benign and neither require any fallow up nor treatment."

    "question": "A 56-year-old white male presents with dyspnea for the last 3 manths. His dyspnea was initially exertional but it has worsened progressively and now he is breathless even at rest. He denies any chest pain ar ankle swelling. He has been smoking one-pack/day cigarettes for the last 30 years and has been drinking alcohal heavily for the last 10 years. He is not taking any medication. His mather died of breast cancer at 57. His vitals are, PR: 86/min, BP: 113/76mm of Hg; Temperature: 37.1C(98 9F); RR: 13/min. On auscultation of his precardium an S3 is heard, but there are no murmurs. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral basal crepitations. Chest x-ray shows marked cardiac silhouette enlargement and pulmonary venous congestion. EKG shows non-specific ST-T wave changes. Echocardiography shows a dilated left ventricle and systolic dysfunction (EF of 25-30%). CBC shows hematocrit of 32%, WBC count of 8,000/microL, and platelet count of 60,000/microL. Peripheral blood smear shaws MCV of 101 fL. LFTs show AST of 180U/L and ALT of 66 U/L. The findings of cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are not compatible with the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Which of the following measures is mast likely to reverse his heart failure?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cessation of cigarette smaking",
      "B. Abstinence from alcohal",
      "C. Reduced salt intake",
      "D. Use of ACE inhibitors",
      "E. Use of digoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is mast likely suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to alcoholism. Findings of thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis, and elevated transaminases are all suggestive af alcohalism in this patient. His cardiomyopathy could be due to ischemia but coranary angiography excluded this diagnosis in this patient. Total abstinence from alcohol is the mainstay of alcoholic cardiomyopathy management and it may reverse this condition if it is employed earlier in the course of the disease.\nReduced salt intake only improves symptoms of heart failure and does not reverse the disease process itself.\nDigitalis is most useful in those heart failure patients who have systolic dysfunction and have rapid ventricular rates due to atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. It proves to be useful in these cases by its positive inotropic effect and negative dromatropic (slowing AY conduction). Use of digitalis has not been shown to provide any survival advantage in patients with congestive heart failure and has not been shown ta reverse the disease process.\nACE inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression af heart failure but they don't reverse the disease process of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. ACE inhibitors should be given to all patients with heart failure who have systolic dysfunction unless they are contraindicated or the patients can't tolerate them.\nCigarette smoking is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and its cessation should be encouraged in all patients with heart failure. Cessation of cigarette smoking does not reverse the disease process of alcohalic cardiomyopathy.\nEducational Objective:\nKnow how to diagnose and manage a patient with congestive heart failure due to alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy."

In spite of these undesirable side effects, thiazide diuretics demonstrated decreased cardiovascular martality and morbidity at least equal to that of the novel agents (ACE inhibitars, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) in large-scale clinical trials. These beneficial long-term effects were shown in various subgroups of patients including diabetics. This patient is also at risk of acute gout arthritis due to uric acid retention induced by hydrochlorothiazide. Electrolyte abnormalities that can be induced by thiazide diuretics include hyponatremia, hypokalemia (Choice B) and hypercalcemia (Choice A).\nEducational Objective:\nThiazide diuretics have some unfavorable metabolic side effects including hyperglycemia, increased LDL cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides. Electrolyte abnormalities that can be induced by thiazide diuretics include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia.\n*Extremely high yield question far USMLE!"

    "question": "A 62-year-old African American male comes to your office complaining of exertional dyspnea. He denies any shortness of breath at rest, but he can hardly walk half a block without stopping to catch his breath. He has no chest pain, palpitations, or cough. Cardiac auscultation findings over the apex are given below. Which of the following best explains this patient's physical findings?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascending aortic aneurysm",
      "B. Long-standing hypertension",
      "C. Mitral valve prolapse",
      "D. Pericardial effusion"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In addition to the normal S1 and S2, this patient's auscultatory findings demonstrate an additional diastalic sound just prior to S1 known as the fourth heart sound (S4). The presence of the fourth heart sound produces a rhythm that is often referred to as \"TEN-nes-see\", with S4 corresponding to the first syllable. In adults, the S4 is an indicator of a stiff left ventricle, which accurs in the setting of restrictive cardiomyopathy ar left ventricular hypertrophy fram prolonged hypertension. Occurring near the end of diastole, S4 corresponds with atrial contraction and is believed ta result from the sound of blood striking a stiffened left ventricle.\nThis patient's combination of exertional dyspnea and S4 likely indicate the presence of diastolic heart failure, which is most commonly the sequela of left ventricular hypertrophy fram prolonged hypertension.\n(Choice A) An ascending aortic aneurysm is often associated with aortic regurgitation, which would result in a diastolic murmur as opposed ta an extra heart sound.\n(Choice C) Mitral valve prolapse characteristically produces a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur heard best aver the cardiac apex.\n(Choice D) Fericardial effusions can be associated with acute pericarditis, which typically produces a pericardial friction rub on cardiac auscultation.\nEducational objective:\nThe fourth heart sound (S4) is a low frequency sound heard at the end of diastole just before S1 that is commonly associated with left ventricular hypertrophy from prolonged hypertension."

    "question": "An imaging study detects a 3.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm in a 60-year-old male. He has no associated symptoms. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesteralemia and hypothyroidism. His medications include aspirin, metfarmin, glipizide, hydrochlorathiazide, lisinopril, low dose atorvastatin and levothyroxine. He has smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years, and he drinks 1-2 glasses of wine daily. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg and his pulse is 80/min. Heart sounds are normal and his lungs are clear. Laboratory studies show:\nSerum creatinine                      1.7 mg/dL\nLow density lipoprotein (LDL)          150 mg/dL\nHbA1C                                 8.5%\nSerum TSH                            3.0\nWhich of the following interventions would most reduce the likelihood of his aortic aneurysm enlarging?",
    "options": [
      "A. Better control of hypertension",
      "B. Better control of hypercholesteralemia",
      "C. Better control of diabetes",
      "D. Smoking cessation",
      "E. Alcohol cessation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "For abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAS) greater than about 5 cm in diameter, surgery is typically recommended. This cutoff was chosen because the risk of rupture increases dramatically at this diameter. For patients with smaller AAAs periodic imaging should be done to assess far aneurysm growth. Rapid growth itself can be an indication for surgical repair. Smoking is a major risk factor for aneurysm formation, enlargement, and rupture. Continued smaking increases the rate of aneurysm growth by about 25%. In most patients, atherosclerosis is the underlying precipitant for AAA formation, but altering ather atherosclerotic risk factors has not been demanstrated to have as much impact as smoking cessation. Thus, smoking cessation is the medical intervention with the greatest potential impact far this patient.\n(Choice A) Hypertension is a risk factor far atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation. Hypertensian in patients with AAA should be treated with beta-blockers.\n(Choice B) Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for AAA development and should be treated, but will not have as much impact on AAA progression as smaking cessation.\n(Choice C) Improved diabetes contral will improve the patient's averall survival, but will not have much impact on progression of AAA size as smoking cessation.\n(Choice E) Alcohol cessation will undoubtedly improve the patient's overall health, but will nat slow progression of AAA size.\nEducational objective:\nIndications for surgery in patients with AAA include; diameter greater than about 5 cm, presence of symptoms, or rapid rate af growth. For patients being medically managed, smoking cessation is the intervention with the greatest likelihood of slowing A&A progression."

    "question": "A 68-year-old white female presents to the ER complaining of sudden onset chest pain associated with twa episodes of vomiting. She has hypertension for which she takes atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide. Her pulse is 60/min, blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg and respirations are 14/min. Examination shows elevated jugular venous pressure and a positive Kussmaul's sign. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her EKG shows 2 mm ST segment elevation in leads II, III and aVF and 1 mm ST segment depression in leads I and aVL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hypotension?",
    "options": [
      "A. Pulmonary thromboembolism",
      "B. Right ventricular infarction",
      "C. Interventricular septum rupture",
      "D. Variant angina",
      "E. Intravascular volume depletion"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's hypatension is caused by right ventricular infarction. The patient has ST elevations in the inferior leads, which strongly suggests an inferior infarct. Involvement of the right ventricle is present in 1/3 of inferior infarcts. Furthermore, ST depression in leads I and AVL (the left-most leads) may reflect STEMI affecting the right side of the heart. Right sided ECG leads can be placed to confirm a right ventricular infarct. Jugular venous distention and Kussmaul's sign (increase in JVD with inspiration) alang with clear lung fields all point towards right ventricular failure. Failure of the right ventricle leads to decreased preload, and therefore can result in decreased cardiac output and hypatension. This patient also has a relatively low heart rate given her hypotension which is suggestive of possible SA node ischemia. Patients with right ventricular infarcts require a high preload to maintain their blood pressure, and are therefore treated with IV fluids. Preload reducing agents such as nitroglycerine and diuretics must be avoided.\n(Answer A) Pulmonary thromboembalism can often present similarly to right ventricular infarction, with right sided heart failure and hypatensian if the embolus is massive. The finding of ST Elevation on the EKG points towards MI, whereas PE is more likely ta present with sinus tachycardia, new onset RBBB or S1Q3T3 on EEE\n(Answer C) Interventricular septum rupture can lead to a left-to-right shunt. The resulting increased strain an the right ventricle can result in right ventricular failure. However, a pansystalic murmur would likely be heard an exam and ST elevations would not be expected.\n(Answer D) Variant angina may present with transient ST elevations, but should not cause hypotension ar physical exam findings of right sided heart failure.\n(Answer E) Intravascular volume depletion can cause hypotensian, but is associated with flattened jugular veins and nat elevated VF.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with an inferior MI may suffer right ventricular infarction, leading to right sided heart failure. Hypotension, jugular venous distention and clear lung fields should raise suspicion for right ventricular infarction. Such patients are preload dependent and should be treated with IV fluids and avoidance of preload reducing medications such as nitrates and diuretics."

    "question": "A 72-year-old male is admitted to the hospital with chest pain. EKG and cardiac enzymes confirm a myocardial infarction and he is started on nitroglycerine, aspirin, simvastatin and low molecular weight heparin. Four days later, he complains of leg pain. Physical examination reveals a cold, pale leg. The angiogram is shown below.\nWhat is the best next step in his management?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Intravenous streptokinase",
      "B. Clopidogrel",
      "C. Cilostazol",
      "D. Leg elevation and warm compress",
      "E. Embolectomy"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's angiogram is diagnostic of acute popliteal artery occlusion. Contrast can be seen filling the superior partion of the artery before the column of contrast abruptly ends in the popliteal fossa — a pattern suggestive of embolic occlusion. Clinically, \"5 P's\" point toward this diagnosis: pain, pulselessness, paresthesia, paikilothermia (coldness), and pallor. Associated morbidity and mortality are significant, so one must maintain a high index of suspicion. The patient's recent myocardial infarction makes an embalus from the heart a likely culprit. Heparin therapy should be initiated based on a suggestive histary and physical exam, without delay far confirmatory testing. For a limb that is still viable, the next treatment step is either percutaneous thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy. Since this patient has already had an angiogram, intra-arterial thrombolysis ar mechanical embaolectomy could be attempted. Surgical embalectamy is an option as well. For a nonviable limb, surgery is mandatory.\n(Choice A) Streptokinase is a fibrinolytic agent. While intravenous infusion of a fibrinalytic agent is an option for STEMI patients, patients with acute limb ischemia typically are treated with direct intra-arterial, not intravenous, administration of a fibrinolytic agent an the clot using an angiographic catheter.\n(Choice B) Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that promotes anticoagulation, but does not rapidly break up already existing clots.\n(Choice C) Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation and causes vasodilation. It is sometimes used to treat chronic claudication, but it has na rale in acute limb ischemia.\n(Choice D) Leg elevation and warm campresses would be inadequate therapy for this patient since his limb is likely to soon become nonviable.\nEducational objective:\nThe diagnosis of acute limb ischemia should be considered in patients who present with the \"five P's\"; pain, pulselessness, paresthesias, poikilothermia (coldness), and pallor. Angiography will typically shaw an abrupt cutoff of arterial blood flow. IV heparin should be started immediately upon suspicion. The definitive treatment is surgical embaolectomy or intra-arterial fibrinolysis/mechanical embolectamy via interventional radiology."

    "question": "A 53-year-old man presents to your office complaining of weakness and exertional dyspnea aver the last week. He denies chest pain and palpitations. He has no other past medical history. His father died of a myacardial infarction at age 55. On exam, his heart rate is 100/min and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. Internal jugular venous pulsation is observed 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart sounds are muffled. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's complaints?",
    "options": [
      "A. Decreased cardiac contractility",
      "B. Left ventricular outflow obstruction",
      "C. Decreased left ventricular preload",
      "D. Pulmonary hypertension",
      "E. Increased right ventricular compliance"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has all three of Beck's triad for cardiac tamponade: hypotension, jugular venous distention (JVD), and muffled heart sounds. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial space fills with fluid. This can result fram many causes, including infection, myocardial infarction, malignancy, uremia, and trauma. Of note, the degree of clinical symptoms depends largely an how quickly the pericardial fluid accumulates. The faster it accumulates, the sooner symptoms will develop.\nThe pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade is as follows. When fluid in the pericardial sac causes the pressure to rise above the diastolic pressure of the ventricles, the ventricles become less able to expand to accept venous return to the heart. As a result of the decrease in preload, stroke volume falls and thus cardiac output is reduced. The decrease in cardiac output is further exacerbated during inspiration because the lower intrathoracic pressure allows mare systemic venous blood to return to the right ventricle, causing the intraventricular septum to bow inta the left ventricle and further reduce left ventricular filling. This phenomenan is responsible for the finding of pulsus paradoxus on exam. A hepatojugular reflex might alsa be observed on exam.\n(Choice A) Decreased cardiac contractility is observed in patients with systolic heart failure. They will typically have signs of both left ventricular failure (e.g. crackles on pulmanary exam and an S3) and right ventricular failure (e.g., JVD and peripheral edema). The patient in this vignette does not have signs of left ventricular failure.\n(Choice B) Left ventricular outflow obstruction results from critical aortic stenosis or from hypertrophic abstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Although this patient does have exertional dyspnea, there is no ather suggestion of aortic stenosis (e.g., syncope, systolic murmur) in this vignette, and most patients with HOCM present at a much earlier age. Importantly, the systolic murmur of HOCM will decrease with squatting and increase with straining.\n(Choice D) Fulmanary hypertension can result from increased pulmonary arterial pressure, as with primary pulmanary hypertension, or with increased pulmonary venous pressure, as occurs in left ventricular failure. The cardiac exam will reveal a loud S2. Pulmanary arterial hypertension is typically an indolent process and does not present as right heart failure until late in the disease.\n(Choice E) Right ventricular compliance will decrease, not increase, in cardiac tamponade.\nEducational Objective:\nThe classic physical exam findings of cardiac tamponade are pulsus paradoxus and Beck's triad: hypotension, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds. When the pericardial space fills with fluid, the ventricles are less able to expand to accept venous return to the heart. As a result, overall preload to the heart decreases."

    "question": "A 24-year-old military recruit is brought to the emergency room after suddenly collapsing while at training camp. Witnesses say he lost consciousness, and in the ER he appears confused. He had apparently been in his usual state of good health until this incident. His medical history includes allergic rhinitis for which he takes chlarpheniramine. On physical examination, his temperature is 41°C (106°F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 22/min, and pulse is 130/min and regular. He appears restless. His pupils are 4mm in size, symmetric, and reactive to light. Lung exam reveals a few rales at both lung bases. His abdomen is saft, nan-tender and bowel sounds are present. There is no neck stiffness. His skin is dry and hot. He has 2+ symmetric reflexes in the upper and lower extremities. Muscle tone and bulk are normal.

      "F. Hypothalamic stroke",
      "G. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome",
      "H. Sympathomimetic toxicity"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This young military recruit was likely engaged in strenuous exercise at the time of his callapse. Although no mention is made of the outdoor conditions, itis likely that he was exposed to hot, humid weather. In atmospheres with mare than 75% humidity, sweating (the body's main mechanism of heat dissipation) may become ineffective, and hyperthermia can result. Furthermaore, this patient was taking an antihistamine, which also has anticholinergic activity and can further impair heat dissipation.\nHeat stroke is defined as a body temperature above 40.5°C (105°F) (Choice A). Dehydration is comman in heat stroke, and is manifested in this patient by hot, dry skin and hypotension. Tachycardia, tachypnea and hemocaoncentration are all signs consistent with dehydration as well. Hyperthermia in heat stroke disrupts enzymatic activity, resulting in multi-organ system effects. Seizures, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hepatic/renal failure may occur. In this patient, ARDS is indicated by scattered rales on exam, and DIC is suggested by low platelets and PT/PTT prolongation.\n(Choice B) Meningitis is unlikely given the lack of nuchal rigidity or photosensitivity. Also, the onset of meningitis is rarely so acute.\n(Choice C) Anticholinergic toxicity may present with hot dry skin, tachycardia, and hyperthermia, as in this patient. However, bowel sounds would be absent, and systemic effects like DIC and ARDS would not be expected.\n(Choice D & G) Serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) belong in the differential for patients with hyperthermia. However, hypertension and neuromuscular hyperactivity are praminent in these conditions.\n(Choice E) Thyroid storm presents with tachycardia, hyperthermia, and altered mental status. However, DIC and ARDS are not expected.\n(Choice F) A hypothalamic stroke would cause dysregulation of one's body temperature and metabolism. This diagnosis is unlikely in this young, healthy patient and would not explain his pulmonary and hematologic symptoms.\n(Choice H) Sympathomimetic toxicity may present with hyperthermia. However, hypertension and mydriasis would be expected, rather than the findings described here.\nEducational objective:\nHeat stroke is defined as a temperature above 40.5°C (105°F). Exertional heat stroke occurs in otherwise healthy individuals exercising in extreme heat. Dehydration, hypotension, tachycardia and tachypnea are comman. Systemic effects like seizures, ARDS, DIC, and hepatic/renal failure may alsa occur."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has developed difficulty concentrating, fatigue, dry skin, and weight gain while receiving treatment for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. These symptoms are concerning for amiodarane-induced hypothyroidism. Because of this adverse effect of amiodarone use, patients receiving amiodarone therapy must have their TSH followed regularly. Amiodarane can alsa cause lung fibrosis and liver toxicity, thus, patients require regular assessments of pulmanary function and liver enzyme concentrations as well.\n(Choice A) Hydralazine can cause salt retention, reflex tachycardia, and a lupus-like syndrome.\n(Choice B) Metoprolol can cause impatence, bradycardia, and AY node blockade.\n(Choice C) Comman side effects of verapamil include constipation, dizziness, and flushing.\n(Choice D) Enalapril is most commonly associated with hyperkalemia, cough, decreased GFR rash, and angioedema.\n(Choice F) Digoxin can cause nausea, vamiting, diarrhea, blurry yellow vision, and arrhythmias.\nEducational objective:\nAmiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic but its use is associated with several potential side effects. In particular, it can cause pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, and thyroid dysfunction. Pulmonary function tests, liver function tests, and thyroid function tests should be monitored in patients on chranic amiodarone therapy."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Aartic regurgitation (AR) is associated with a wide pulse pressure (systolic — diastolic blood pressure), 95 mmHg in this patient. A wide pulse pressure causes a \"water hammer pulse,\" which many patients experience as a pounding heartbeat. Lying flat and turning to the left brings the heart closer ta the chest wall and can make the patient mare aware of the farceful heartbeat. Inthe U.S. aortic root dilation and bicuspid aortic valve are the most common causes of AR In many other countries where antibiotics are less available, rheumatic fever is the most comman cause.\n(Choice B) Fulmanary regurgitation should not cause widening of the peripheral pulse pressure.\n(Choice C) Mitral stenosis can also accur secandary to rheumatic heart disease, but typically causes pulmanary symptoms like pulmonary edema and hemoptysis. Mitral stenosis would nat be expected to cause widening of the peripheral pulse pressure.\n(Choice D) Tricuspid stenosis typically causes symptoms of right sided heart failure with clear lungs. The peripheral pulse pressure would nat be increased.\n(Choice E) In contrast to the \"water hammer pulse\" of AR patients with aortic stenosis usually have a weak pulse described as \"parvus et tardus\"\nEducational objective:\nAartic regurgitation causes widening of the pulse pressure, which can be felt as a \"water hammer\" pulse. Lying down and turning to the left brings the heart closer to the chest wall and can make the patient more aware of the forceful heartbeat."

      "F. Pulmonary infarction"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's dilated pupils and blood-crusted nose suggest cocaine abuse. Cocaine inhibits catecholamine reuptake from neuronal synapses, and is therefore sympathomimetic. In some, cocaine-induced vasospasm can be so severe as to cause myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, which, given this patient's chest pain and ST elevations, is likely the case here. Patients may not always be forthcoming about drug use, so itis impartant to maintain a high index of suspician in the right clinical setting. Cocaine-induced ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) are treated the same as classic STEMIs, with PTCA ar thrombolysis. Aspirin and nitrates are also appropriate, but beta-blockers should be avoided. Beta-blocker therapy administered to cocaine-using individuals allows unopposed alpha agonist activity that can worsen vasospasm. Calcium channel blockers and alpha blockers like phentolamine can alsa help reduce vasospasm in these patients.\n(Choice A) Atherosclerotic heart disease would be rare in a patient this young without documented additional risk factors.\n(Choice B) Acute pericarditis can cause ST elevations on EKG, which are often accompanied by PR depressions. Pericarditis is not a comman complication of cocaine use.\n(Choice C) Fleuradynia is chest pain typically of pulmanary etiology that is warse with deep breathing. While cocaine can cause pleuritic chest pain through a variety of different mechanisms, ST elevations would not be expected on EKG.\n(Choice E) While cocaine can cause aortic dissection, this patient's ST elevations are more suggestive of myocardial infarctian.\nEducational objective:\nFupillary dilation and blood at the external nares in a patient with chest pain can be a clue to cocaine-induced vasospasm. ST elevation myocardial infarctions can occur as a consequence of cocaine use."

Presence of papilledema in this patient is consistent with a diagnosis of malignant hypertension. Although the blood pressure of the patients with malignant hypertension is usually >= 200/140 mmHg (Choice E}, papiledema should be present in arder to make a diagnosis of malignant hypertension. Renal failure with elevated creatinine level (Choice B) and aliguria (Choice D) can develop rapidly in this case without treatment, but its presence is nat required to diagnose malignant hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG (Choice A) is nat a diagnostic criterion for malignant hypertension.\nEducational Objective:\nAlways suspect malignant hypertension in patients with very high blood pressure (>= 200/140 mmHg).

This patient alsa has slightly elevated transaminases, another potential side effect of statin therapy.\n(Choice A) Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blacker (ARB), and as such its comman side effects are hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal failure.\n(Choice C) N-acetylcysteine has three primary uses: dissolution of mucus, protection against contrast induced renal failure, and therapy far acetaminophen averdase.\n(Choice D & E) The mild elevation of this patient's transaminases is likely the result of his statin therapy. To confirm that this is the case, liver function tests can be repeated after the statin is stopped to ensure that the AST and ALT are trending dawn.\nEducational objective:\nCPK levels should be checked in any patient on a statin who presents with myalgias.

    "question": "A 50-year-old white male comes into your office for a routine check up. He has no present complaints. His past medical histary is significant for hypertension controlled with a low-dose thiazide diuretic. His family history reveals non-fatal myocardial infarction in his father at the age of 47. The patient does not smoke or consume alcohol. His blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg and his heart rate is 70/min. His previous records show that his HDL level is persistently low in spite of acceptable total cholesterol and LDL levels. You prescribe niacin to raise HDL level. The patient returns in a week complaining of intensive generalized pruritis and flushing. What is the most probable cause of the patient's complaint?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hypersensitivity reaction",
      "B. Prostaglandin-related reaction",
      "C. Drug interaction",
      "D. Drug-induced vasoconstriction",
      "E. Psychogenic reaction"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cutaneous flushing and intensive generalized pruritis are well-known side effects of high-dose niacin therapy (high dose is required to treat lipid abnormalities). These effects are explained by niacin-induced peripheral vasodilatation, not vasoconstriction (Choice D). The mechanism invalved in this reaction is believed to be drug-induced release af histamine and prostaglandins, but not a true hypersensitivity reaction (Choice A). The role of prostaglandins in this reaction is canfirmed by the fact that low-dose aspirin can greatly reduce ar prevent cutaneous flushing and pruritis if taken 30 minutes before niacin. Therefore, niacin is frequently prescribed with aspirin. It is important to know that flushing and pruritis usually improve after 2-4 weeks of therapy.\nThiazide diuretics do nat intensify this reaction (Choice C), although may predispose the patient to hypotension.\nPsychogenic cause (Choice E) of the patient's complaint is unlikely.\nEducational Objective:\nHigh-dose niacin therapy that is used to treat lipid abnormalities frequently produces cutaneous flushing and pruritis. This side effect is explained by prostaglandin-induced peripheral vasodilatation and can be reduced by low-dose aspirin."

    "question": "A 74-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of diarrhea and decreased appetite over the past week as well as increasing fatigue and occasional palpitations over the last few days. Her past medical history is significant for chronic atrial fibrillation for which she takes metoprolol, digoxin and warfarin. She smokes cigarettes and has for the past several years. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg and her heart rate is 70/min and irregular. Lung auscultation reveals scattered wheezes. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender. The liver span is 8 cm and the spleen is not palpable. There is no ankle edema. Her last measured INR was 2.3 two weeks ago. Which of the following is the best initial test in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Echocardiography",
      "B. Chest x-ray",
      "C. Pulmonary function tests",
      "D. Thyroid function tests",
      "E. Blood drug level",
      "F. PT, INR measurement",
      "G. ECG stress testing"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This is a patient receiving treatment for chronic atrial fibrillation who presents with diarrhea and nausea. Given her medication list, the most likely culprit for her symptoms is digoxin intoxication. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used ta treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Because it has myriad adverse effects, patient's digoxin levels must be monitored closely. Potential side effects of digoxin include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurry yellow vision, and arrhythmias. Characteristic ECG findings in digoxin toxicity include scooped ST segments, prolonged PR intervals, shortened QT intervals, and T-wave inversion. Renal failure and hypokalemia exacerbate digoxin toxicity.\n(Choice A) Echocardiography can be beneficial in evaluating systolic and diastolic function, ejection fraction, wall motion abnormalities, and valve disorders. This patient does not have clinical features suggestive of heart failure.\n(Choice B) Aside from wheezes on exam, this patient does not clinical signs suggestive of a primary pulmonary process. Mareaver, none of her medications cause significant pulmanary toxicity, and lung disease would probably not cause her Gl symptoms.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary function tests are used to diagnose restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases. Although she has wheezing on physical exam, which may suggest a component of branchoconstriction, neither COPD nor asthma would account for her Gl symptoms.\n(Choice D) TSH, T3, and T4 levels are measured to evaluate a patient's thyroid function. Hyperthyroidism can cause diarrhea, palpitations, and changes in appetite. However, it is mare likely that this patient's presentation is related to an adverse medication effect rather than to a new disease process.\n(Choice F) Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, affects the PT and INR. The goal for warfarin therapy in atrial fibrillation is an INR between 2 and 3, and this patient was at that goal on the most recent evaluation. Furthermore, she is not demonstrating any symptoms suggestive of an angoing coagulopathy.\n(Choice G) Stress testing would be a reasonable investigation in an older woman complaining of palpitations, but caranary artery disease would not explain this patient's Gl symptoms. Mareover, an ECG stress test can be very difficult to interpret in someone with baseline ECG abnormalities from digoxin use.\nEducational Objective:\nDigoxin is a cardiac glycoside whose adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, vision changes, and arrhythmias. Patient's digoxin levels must be followed closely."

    "question": "A 43-year-old male complains of frequent epigastric burning not relieved by antacids. The sensation is typically brought on by heavy lifting at work and takes 10-15 minutes to go away. He denies having associated arm or neck pain, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing. His past medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed five years ago, for which he takes low-dose prednisone daily. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg and pulse is 80/min and regular. Heart, lung, and abdomen exams are unremarkable. EKG is normal. Which of the following is the best next step in managing this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Echocardiogram",
      "B. Coronary angiography",
      "C. Exercise EKG",
      "D. Myocardial perfusion testing",

      "G. Abdominal CT scan",
      "H. Abdominal ultrasound",
      "I. Chest CT scan"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The first step in managing this patient should be to obtain an exercise EKG, as the exertional nature af his discomfort is concerning for ischemic heart disease. Both SLE and chronic steroid use are risk factars for accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. Exercise may induce ischemic changes on EKG that might not be present at rest. Since the patient's baseline EKG is normal and he is able to exercise, imaging with the stress test (Choice D) is unnecessary. If the stress test is normal, then further warkup for the cause of the burning sensation could be dane, probably focusing on a possible Gl etiology.\n(Choice A) In a patient with baseline EKG changes, an exercise echocardiogram can help assess for regional wall motion abnormalities. A resting echocardiogram, however, is not an effective test for coronary artery disease.\n(Choice B) Coronary angiography is the gold standard for detecting coronary artery disease, but is probably more aggressive than is necessary at this time. If the patient's stress test is positive, coronary angiography may be necessary.\n(Choice E) Esophageal motility studies can be useful in patients with dysphagia or suspected diffuse esophageal spasm or nutcracker esophagus. This patient's pattern of discomfort with exertion makes Gl etiologies less likely.\n(Choice F) Upper Gl endoscopy to look for peptic ulcer disease would likely be the next test performed if this patient's stress test is negative.\nEducational objective:\nIschemic cardiac pain can sometimes be mistaken for epigastric pain, but should remain high an the differential, especially in the setting of symptoms warsened with exertion. An exercise stress test without imaging is the mast reasonable first step if the baseline resting EKG is normal."

    "question": "A 64-year-old white female presents for evaluation of two weeks of decreased appetite and nausea. She also notes occasional palpitations, which have been especially prominent over the past two days. Her medical history is significant for an anterior wall myocardial infarction one year ago and secondary congestive heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Her current medications include aspirin, digoxin, furosemide, enalapril and metoprolol. On physical examination, her blood pressure is120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 106/min and respirations are 15/min. The remainder of her exam is unremarkable. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette and normal lung fields. On labaratary testing, her digoxin level is twice the upper limit of normal. You order an EKG. Which of the following arrhythmias is most specific for digitalis toxicity?",
    "options": [
      "A. Atrial flutter",
      "B. Atrial fibrillation",
      "C. Mobitz type II second-degree AV block",
      "D. Atrial tachycardia with AV block",
      "E. Multifocal atrial tachycardia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Atrial tachycardia with AV block is the arrhythmia mast specific for digitalis toxicity. Digitalis can increase ectopy in the atria or ventricles, which can lead ta atrial tachycardia. Atrial tachycardia is distinguished fram atrial flutter by its somewhat slower atrial rate (150-250 bpm as opposed to 250-350 bpm). P-waves are present, but may appear different fram the p-waves normally seen when conduction originates in the SA node. In atrial tachycardia, the closer the ectopic focus is ta the SA node, the closer the resemblance of its p-waves to normal p-waves originating from the SA node. In addition ta causing ectopic rhythms, digitalis can alsa increase vagal tone and decrease conduction through the AY node, potentially causing AY block. Since it is rare for both ectopy and AV block to occur at the same time, when they do, the combination is fairly specific for digitalis toxicity.\n(Choice A) Digitalis toxicity does not commanly cause atrial flutter.\n(Choice B) There are many potential causes of atrial fibrillation, but digitalis toxicity is not one of them. Digitalis can be used to increase vagal tone and is sometimes used to treat atrial fibrillation if beta-blockers ar calcium channel blockers have not been completely effective.\n(Choice C) Digitalis would not be expected to cause Mobitz type II second-degree AV black, as this invalves pathology of the conduction system belaw the AV node.\n(Choice E) Multifocal atrial tachycardia is rarely associated with digitalis use. Itis mare commonly a consequence of pulmonary disease.\nEducational objective:\nDigitalis toxicity causes increased ectopy and increased vagal tone. Atrial tachycardia with AV block occurs fram the combination of these two digitalis effects, and is relatively specific far digitalis toxicity."

    "question": "A 63-year-old male is admitted for sudden onset severe chest pain. His ECG reveals ST elevation in leads V2-V6. He is treated with thrombolytic therapy, heparin, aspirin, metoprolol, morphine, and nitrates. A coronary angiogram performed after thrombolytic therapy reveals 50% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient suddenly develops severe shortness of breath at rest and hypotension. Examination reveals a soft S1, an apical pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla, and bibasilar crackles. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure is 92/58 mm Hg, heart rate is 102/min, and respirations are 31/min. An echocardiogram performed on the second hospital day reveals an akinetic region of the anterior wall. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration?",
    "options": [
      "A. Pericardial tamponade",
      "B. Pulmonary embolism",
      "C. Rupture of ventricular septum",
      "D. Papillary muscle dysfunction",
      "E. Acute aortic dissection"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient suffered an anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) and was treated appropriately. The development of hemodynamic campromise 3-7 days after an Ml raises suspicion for mechanical complications of MI, as this is the point during the healing process in which the infarcted myocardium is softest and most prone to rupture. The three major mechanical complications of Ml include mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture, left ventricle free wall rupture, and interventricular septum rupture. While all three complications can result in hypotension, the presence of a pansystalic murmur that is loudest at the apex with radiation to the axilla is the classic murmur of mitral regurgitation. S1 is the sound formed by closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves, and improper closure af the mitral valve will soften S1. Shartness of breath and bibasilar crackles are indicative of pulmonary edema and left ventricular failure. Therefore, these clinical manifestations are consistent with acute mitral regurgitation.\n(Choice A) Rupture of the left ventricular free wall classically results in pericardial tamponade. While this condition often results in sudden death, patients wha survive the initial insult may develop hypotension, jugular venous distension, distant heart sounds, pericardial rub, and pulsus paradoxus.\n(Choice B) This patient's mobility is likely compromised by his recent MI, thereby placing him at increased risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). PE frequently presents with dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hypotension. Mitral regurgitation or new onset murmurs are nat typically identified.\n(Choice C) Like papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal rupture results in a pansystolic murmur. It differs in that the murmur is heard best at the left sternal border, often has an accompanying thrill, and is less likely to radiate to the axilla.\n(Choice E) Acute aortic dissection classically presents with hypertension—nat hypotension, tearing chest ar back pain, and unequal pulses. This patient's murmur and pulmanary edema are not characteristic of aortic dissection.\nEducational Objective:\nThe three major mechanical complications of Ml include mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture, left ventricle free wall rupture, and interventricular septum rupture. While all three of these developments can result in hypotension, a pansystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex with radiation to the axilla is the classic characterization of mitral regurgitation."

On physical examination, her pulse is 79/min and blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation reveals a high-pitched 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the second right intercostal space. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Chest x-ray shows a normal sized heart and clear lung fields. What is the most likely cause of this patient's chest pain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery",
      "B. Atherosclerotic narrawing of the coronaries",

      "D. Increased myocardial oxygen extraction",
      "E. Stretching of the papillary muscles"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's exertional chest pain that improves with rest suggests angina. The description of her murmur is consistent with aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis in a young individual is usually the result of a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. Patients with severe aortic stenosis often have large left ventricular mass, which then requires additional oxygen. In such patients, increased myocardial oxygen demand can cause anginal pain. Accompanying prolonged myocardial contraction and impaired diastale, both of which reduce blood flow through the coronary arteries, exacerbate the situation. (Given her histary and young age, hypertrophic abstructive cardiomyopathy should also be considered. However, the classic murmur of this condition is usually located at the left lower sternal border.)\n(Choice A) &n anomalous right caronary artery arigin can lead to angina if the artery is compressed by other structures, but there should be no murmur an cardiac auscultation.\n(Choice B) Atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronaries can lead ta symptoms of angina, but is unlikely in this patient given her young age and lack of risk factors.\n(Choice D) The myocardium is usually not able to increase its extraction of oxygen. Instead, the myocardium usually meets increased oxygen demands by inducing dilation of the coronary arteries.\n(Choice E) Stretching of the papillary muscles can lead to mitral regurgitation, but this murmur is normally heard best at the apex. Mitral regurgitation can occur secondary to myocardial ischemia, but it does not typically cause myocardial ischemia.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with severe aortic stenosis can have anginal chest pain due to increased myocardial oxygen demand."

      "C. Abdominal aartic aneurysm",
      "D. Raynaud phenomenon",
      "E. Pulmonary embolism"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has variant angina, also known as Prinzmetal's angina. It is caused by temparary spasm of the coronary arteries, as opposed to atherosclerotic narrowing which is seen in myocardial infarction. Young women are classically affected, and the greatest risk factar far variant angina is smoking. Aside fram smoking, there is often an absence of cardiovascular risk factors. Variant angina is associated with other vasospastic disorders, such as Raynaud's phenomenon and migraine headaches. The episodes often occur in the middle of the night (midnight to 8 am) and are precipitated by exercise, hyperventilation, ematianal stress, cold exposure ar cocaine use. The angina episodes are accompanied by transient ST elevations with return of ST segments to baseline upon resolution of symptoms. This is in contrast to the ST depressions seen in unstable angina, and the longer duration of ST elevations seen in myocardial infarction. Medical therapy for variant angina typically involves calcium channel blockers ar nitrates.\n(Choice A) Lacunar strokes occur in the setting of hypertension, and affect small, penetrating arteries which supply the basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and pons. Occlusion of these small arteries by microatheroma and lipohyalinasis is the mechanism of lacunar stroke—not vasospasm.\n(Choices B & C) Intermittent claudication is leq pain that occurs with exercise and is due to atherosclerotic narrowing of the arteries feeding the leg. The mechanism is similar to that of typical angina--nat variant angina. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are alsa the result of atherosclerotic disease.\n(Choice E) The most comman cause of pulmanary embalism is embolization of blood clots from the deep veins of the lower extremities. Variant angina does nat involve embolic phenomena.\nEducational objective:\nYariant Angina (or Frinzmetal's angina) is a vasospastic disorder that typically occurs in young female smakers.

His past medical history is significant for a long history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type 2. He experienced a severe myocardial infarction 6 months ago. His current medications are enalapril, metapralal, aspirin, furosemide, potassium, glyburide and pravastatin, but he says that he has not been taking some of his medications recently. Physical examination reveals acrocyanosis and symmetric 3+ lower extremity edema. Point of maximal apical impulse is displaced to the left, and a holosystolic [IV/VI] apical murmur is heard at the apex. Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are present on ECG. The initial set of cardiac enzymes are positive. The patient continues to deteriorate, despite aggressive diuretic and vasodilator therapy. You perform an echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular function and decide to proceed with pulmonary artery catheterization.

      "E. CI normal, TPR decreased, LVEDY increased"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is consistent with systolic heart failure. Non-compliance with the treatment regimen and acute myocardial damage are the precipitating factors for the acute distress observed in this patient.\nIt is important to know the basic pathophysiologic changes assaciated with heart failure. First, look at Cl, a measure of cardiac output - it is always decreased in systolic heart failure. Next, look at LVEDY - it should be elevated in systolic heart failure, although it may be normal in pure diastolic heart failure (choice D). TPR is elevated in systolic heart failure due to neurohumoral activation that includes sympathetic hyperactivity and activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\nSuboptimal left ventricular filling that may relatively reduce LVEDY can be due ta blood redistribution with low TFR (e.g., anaphylaxis) (choice A) or hypovolemia with elevated TPR (e.g., hemarrhage) (choice B).\nMarmal CI, elevated LVEDY and LVEDP, and decreased TPR can be caused sometimes by high-output heart failure (choice E).\nEducational Objective:\nSystolic heart failure is characterized by depressed cardiac index (Cl) accompanied by increased total peripheral resistance (TPR) and left ventricular end-diastalic volume (LVEDV)."

    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Ventricular preexcitation",
      "B. Impaired SA node automaticity",
      "C. Impaired AV node conduction",
      "D. Atrial reentry",
      "E. His bundle branch block"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The above EKG demonstrates an irregular rhythm, with P waves preceding every QRS but with certain P waves not conducted. Closer examination reveals PR intervals that grow progressively longer between beats, leading up to a dropped beat. This pattern is consistent with second degree, Mabitz type I AV block (Wenckebach). Mobitz type I black is due to dysfunction at the AY node. Patients are generally asymptomatic, but in some cases the dropped beats cause hypoperfusion leading to syncope and/or angina.\n(Choice A) Ventricular preexcitation usually results in premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).\n(Choice B) Impaired SA node automaticity (sick sinus syndrome) mast often results from fibrosis of the sinus node ar disease of the SA nodal artery. Patients may present with bradycardia, lightheadedness, or syncope. On EKG, this often appears as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (bursts of atrial tachyarrhythmia followed by bradycardia).\n(Choice D) Atrial reentry leads ta atrial tachycardia of abrupt onset and terminatian.\n(Choice E) Bundle branch block occurs below the AY node and impedes ventricular depolarization. The result is a prolonged QRS complex.\nEducational objective:\nSecond degree heart block is identified by prolongation of the PR interval with occasional dropped beats. In Mohitz type I, the PR interval gradually lengthens until a beat is dropped. In type II, the PR intervals are of constant length before the dropped beat. The prognosis is better for Mohitz type I, which is the result of AY node dysfunction."

      "D. High aldosterone/renin ratio",
      "E. Increased 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario demonstrates a patient with advanced atherosclerosis, having atherosclerotic lesions of multiple sites: Coronary atherosclerosis, intermittent claudication, a difference between right arm and left arm BP readings. He also has multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, and hypertension. Resistant hypertension in such a patient should make you suspect atherosclerotic narrowing of renal arteries. Continuous (systolic and diastalic) murmur in the periumbilical area, ar in the flanks, is characteristic of renal artery stenosis; the diastolic component makes this murmur more specific, compared to the systolic component alone. If you carefully auscultate the periumbilical area of such a patient with advanced atherosclerosis and resistant hypertension, you have a good chance ta arrive at a carrect diagnosis.\nThe increased pulsation of intercostal arteries (Choice A) is typical for coarctation of the aorta.\nUrinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid (Choice C) is increased in pheochromocytoma.\nA high aldosterone/renin ratio (Choice D) is characteristic for primary hyperaldosteraonism.\nAn increased 24-hour urinal free cortisol excretion (Choice E) is observed in Cushing's syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nRenal artery stenosis is a common cause of resistant hypertension in a patient with advanced atherosclerosis.

      "E. Prevent reperfusion myocardial injury"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is having an ST-elevation Ml in the inferiar distribution (leads II, III, and aVF), likely secondary to an acclusive thrombus. His long-term prognosis is most influenced by the duration of time that lapses befare coranary blood flow is restored. The twa primary options for restaring coronary blood flow are percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (FTCA) and fibrinolysis. FTCA has been shown tao have superiar autcomes compared to fibrinalysis, and should therefore be the chosen reperfusion modality when available. Ideally, FTCA should be done with a \"door-to-balloon” time of less than 90 minutes. When fibrinolytics are used, a \"door-to-needle” time of 30 minutes is the goal.\n(Choice A) Myocardial oxygen demand is determined by heart rate, preload, contractility, and afterload. Medications such as nitrates and beta-blockers affect these parameters and can be used to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. However, these treatments are more effective in angina as opposed to STEMI, as this patient cannot meet much myocardial oxygen demand since there is no coronary blood flow.\n(Choice B) Decreasing blood coagulability with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and/or heparin is part of the management of STEMI. However, these medications only stop the thrombus from progressing. In contrast, FTCA and fibrinolysis disrupt the thrombus that is occluding coranary blood flaw.\n(Choice D) At ane time, lidocaine was recommended as prophylaxis against ischemia-related arrhythmias, but this is no longer the case. Arrhythmias should be treated only as they arise.\n(Choice E) Reperfusion injury can occur after PTCA or fibrinolysis, potentially causing continued myocyte death. However, there are no medications currently available to inhibit this process, and the benefits of reperfusion far autweigh the consequences of reperfusion injury.\nEducational objective:\nThe strongest influence on long-term pragnosis following an ST-elevation myocardial infarction is the duration af time that passes befare coronary blood flow is restored (via FTCA ar fibrinolysis)."

He has never had chest pain before, but does report occasional episodes of dyspnea and coughing. His medical history is significant for eczema. He is not presently taking any medications. His family history is significant for prostate cancer in his father and rheumatoid arthritis in his mother. He does not smoke or consume alcohal. The patient is admitted to the hospital and is given aspirin, low-maolecular weight heparin, metoprolol and captopril. On day 2 of his hospitalization he complains of shortness of breath. Physical examination reveals prolonged expirations and bilateral wheezes. There are no crackles. You estimate the jugular venous pressure to be 7 cm with the patient's head elevated at 45 degrees. Which af the following is most likely responsible for this patient's current respiratory symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Pericarditis",
      "B. Bronchial infection",
      "C. Recurrent myocardial ischemia",
      "D. Right ventricular infarction",
      "E. Pleural effusion",
      "F. Pulmonary embalism",
      "G. Drug side effect"
    ],
    "answer": "G",
    "explanation": "This patient was admitted to the hospital with chest pain concerning for acute caranary syndrome. Shortly after being started an several medications, he developed shortness of breath and prolonged expirations. While the differential diagnosis for dyspnea is broad, we can take several clues fram the vignette to point us toward the carrect diagnosis. First, the patient has a history of intermittent dyspnea and coughing. Given his histary of eczema, these symptoms may represent mild undiagnosed intermittent asthma.\nMetoprolol is a competitive, beta1-selective adrenergic antaganist, but it can also block beta2 receptars in the bronchial tree. (This beta2 effect is mare prominent at higher doses.) In patients with reactive airway disease, beta2 blockade causes bronchaoconstriction with symptoms like wheezing, cough and prolonged expiration. Thus, while beta1-selective adrenergic blockers are preferred over nonselective agents in patients with asthma and COPD, even these agents should be used with caution as the above vignette demonstrates.\n(Choice A) Post-infarction pericarditis is typically seen 2 to 5 days after a myocardial infarction. Autoimmune pericarditis is seen one to several weeks after an acute myocardial infarction or open-heart surgery.\n(Choice B) Bronchitis is characterized by shortness of breath, productive cough and fever. This patient does not have fever or productive cough, making this diagnosis less likely.\n(Choice C) Recurrent myocardial ischemia would likely manifest with pain, but symptoms like nausea and diaphoresis are sometimes the most prominent. Breathlessness due to acute heart failure can occur secondary to myocardial infarction. While wheezing may be present (\"cardiac asthma\"), crackles and elevated jugular venous pressure would also be expected.\n(Choice D) Inferior wall infarctions may damage the right ventricle and present with hypotension and elevated venous pressure, but wheezing would not be expected.\n(Choice E) Pleural effusions present with dullness on tharacic percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased movement of the ipsilateral chest wall.\n(Choice F) Dyspnea, tachypnea and chest pain, but not wheezing, may be signs of a pulmonary embolism.\nEducational objective:\nMetoprolol is a selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist that, when administered in high doses, can block bronchodilatary beta2 adrenergic receptors causing bronchocanstriction in susceptible individuals."

    "question": "A 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents with general malaise and a funny’ heart rhythm far the past 2 weeks. He had an echocardiogram done last year, which revealed mild left atrial dilatation and left ventricular hypertrophy. He has been taking hydrachlorothiazide for hypertension. His blood pressure at today's visit is 180/98 mm Hg. An EKG is obtained and is shown below.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate treatment far this patient?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Immediate cardioversion",
      "B. Lidocaine",
      "C. Adenosine",
      "D. Carotid massage",
      "E. Diltiazem"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by lack of organized atrial activity. Hypertension is the mast comman cause. Other causes include valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, and alcohol. AF is identified on EKG by absent P waves, an irregularly irregular rate, and a narrow CRS complex. This patient has AF with rapid ventricular response, as his heart rate is approximately 140 beats/minute. The treatment of AF depends on a number of factors, including whether the patient is hemodynamically stable and the length of time spent in AF. In patients wha are hemodynamically unstable (low BF, altered mental status), immediate cardioversion is indicated. If the patient is hemodynamically stable—as is the case in this vignette—then the duration of AF must be considered. If AF has been present for <=48 haurs, then electrical ar pharmacologic cardioversion is appropriate. If AF has been present >48 hours, there is a high risk of thromboembalism with cardioversion; such patients should be treated with rate control and 3-4 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion is attempted. Rate control is most often achieved with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is the only rate-controlling agent listed above, and is the correct answer (Choice E).\n(Choice A) Atrial fibrillation has been present for >48 hours in this stable patient, making immediate cardioversion inappropriate.\n(Choice B) Lidocaine is a class Ib antiarrhythmic. It is used to treat ventricular tachycardia but not atrial arrhythmias.\n(Choice C & D) Carotid massage and adenosine may be used to manage patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Carotid massage is a vagal maneuver that slows the heart rate and may terminate SVT. Adenosine works in SVT by causing transient AY nade blockade, which allows identification of the rhythm and terminates certain farms of SVT.\nEducational objective:\nAtrial fibrillation is identified an EKG by an irregularly irregular R-R interval with absent FP waves and narrow CRS complexes. In unstable patients, immediate cardioversion should be performed. In stable patients who have been in atrial fibrillation (AF) <48 hours, cardioversion is appropriate. In stable patients in AF >=48 haurs, 3-4 weeks of rate control and anticoagulation should precede cardioversion."

    "question": "A 53-year-old Caucasian male is admitted to the hospital with a 2-week history of fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance. He says he can hardly climb two flights of stairs without getting dyspneic. He denies palpitations or chest pain. His past medical history is insignificant, and a routine check-up 6 months ago was normal. He admits two episodes of binge drinking during the last month, but says that he 'got it under control\". He is currently not taking any medications. His blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg and heart rate is 130/min, irregular. Lungs are clear on auscultation. ECG does not reveal P waves. Echocardiography shows significant left ventricular dilation with an ejection fraction of 35% and mitral regurgitation (1+). Which of the following intervention will most likely improve the left ventricular function in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Preload optimization",
      "B. Decreasing afterload",
      "C. Rate or rhythm control",
      "D. Inotropic suppart",
      "E. Valve surgery",
      "F. Coronary revascularization"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Prolonged, tachysystalic atrial fibrillation causes significant left ventricular (LV) dilation and a depressed ejection fraction. LV dysfunction results from tachycardia, neurohumoral activation, absence of an atrial ‘kick’ (that accounts for up to 25% of LY end-diastolic valume]), and atrial-ventricular desynchronization. Controlling the rhythm in such patients usually improves the LV function significantly {sometimes even dramatically!}.\n(Choice F) Although an underlying disorder like alcoholic cardiomyopathy ar coronary artery disease may account for LY dysfunction in this patient, rhythm control seems ta be the most effective tool in impraving this patient's condition.\n(Choice A, B and D) Freload optimization, decreasing afterload, and inotropic support are less urgent in this case and would be less beneficial without first controlling the rhythm or rate.\n(Choice E) Slight mitral regurgitation is a secondary event explained by LV dilation.\nEducational Objective:\nControlling the rhythm ar rate in patients with prolonged tachysystolic atrial fibrillation usually improves the LV function significantly, sometimes even dramatically."

      "C. Cardioversion",
      "D. IV diltiazem",
      "E. Carotid massage"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The abave patient has developed ventricular tachycardia (regular, wide complex tachycardia) but there is no hemodynamic compromise. The patient is alert, awake and oriented ta time, place and person and his potassium level is within normal limits; his BP is stable. The cause of the ventricular tachycardia is due to coranary artery disease. The best treatment for a patient with ventricular tachycardia who has no hemodynamic compromise Is loading with either lidocaine or amiodarone. Either of these 2 agents will aid in the conversion to narmal sinus rhythm. However, amiodarone has become the drug of choice (Choice A).\n(Choice B) In the presence of a ventricular tachycardia, digitalis should never be administered as the arrhythmia can worsen. Digoxin is anly used to treat atrial arrhythmias.\n(Choice C) Cardioversian is an excellent aption for sustained ventricular tachycardia with hemadynamic compromise. The above patient has a stable blood pressure and cardioversion is not indicated. However, the electrode pads should be placed an the anterior and posterior chest walls in case the tachycardia does not revert back to normal sinus rhythm.\n(Choice D) IV Cardizem should not be used for ventricular arrhythmia. It is indicated only for atrial arrhythmias.\n(Choice E) Carotid massage is useful for supraventricular tachycardia (narrow complex) nat for ventricular tachycardia. It has na rale in the management of ventricular tachycardia.\nEducational objective:\n“entricular tachycardia in the presence of a stable blood pressure does nat warrant cardioversion. The best treatment is loading with lidocaine ar amiodarone (drug of choice)."

    "question": "A 48-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office complaining of progressive exertional dyspnea. It has become especially bothersome over the past two months. Presently, he becomes short of breath after climbing one flight of stairs. He denies any significant problems in the past. He is not taking any medications and he denies smoking or drinking alcohol. His temperature is 37.2C (98.9F), pulse is 78/min, blood pressure is 130/75 mm of Hg and respirations are 14/min. Chest examination reveals a harsh systalic murmur that is best heard at the right second intercostal space with radiation along the carotid arteries. An S4 is heard at the apex. Based on these findings, what is the mast likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "B. Myxomatous valve degeneration",
      "C. Rheumatic heart disease",
      "D. Bicuspid aortic valve",
      "E. Senile calcific aortic stenosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient appears to be suffering from congestive heart failure as a consequence of aortic stenosis. A harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the caratid arteries is a classic description of the murmur caused by aortic stenasis. The S4 occurs as the result of left atrial kick against a stiff left ventricle. In aortic stenosis, the high resistance generated by the stenosed aartic valve causes concentric hypertrophy and stiffening of the left ventricle, resulting in the S4. The three most common causes or aortic stenosis in the general population are senile calcific aortic stenosis, bicuspid aartic valve, and rheumatic heart disease. The most impartant hint to the underlying etiology of this patient's aortic stenosis is his relatively young age. A bicuspid aortic valve is the cause of aortic stenosis in the majority of patients under 70 years old, so this is the most likely cause of this patient's aortic stenosis.\n(Choice A) The murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be easily confused with that of aortic stenosis. Both entities can cause a systalic crescendo-decrescendo murmur and an S4. However, the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually best appreciated in the lower left sternal border and it does not typically radiate ta the carotids.\n(Choice B) Myxomatous valve degeneration is the typical pathologic entity that causes mitral valve prolapse.\n(Choice C) As mentioned above, rheumatic heart disease can be a cause of aortic stenosis. However itis a much less common cause than either senile calcific aortic stenasis or a bicuspid aortic valve.\n(Choice E) Senile calcific aortic stenosis is the most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients who are alder than 70 years old. As people age, the aortic valve can accumulate calcium, causing stenosis.\nEducational objective:\nThe three most common causes of aortic stenosis in the general population are senile calcific aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve, and rheumatic heart disease. A bicuspid aortic valve is the cause of aortic stenosis in the majority of patients under 70 years old."

    "question": "A 47-year-old Caucasian female presents with occasional episodes of nocturnal substernal chest pain that wakes her up during sleep. The pain episodes last 15-20 minutes and resolve spontaneously. She denies any illicit drug use. She leads a sedentary lifestyle but states that she can climb twa flights of stairs without any discomfort. She has no history of hypertension or diabetes. Her pulse is 75/min and regular, blood pressure is 134/70 mmHg and respirations are 14/min. Extended ambulatory ECG monitoring reveals transient ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL, and V4-V6 during the episodes. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Diltiazem",

      "E. Digoxin",
      "F. Simvastatin",
      "G. Heparin",
      "H. Streptokinase"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has variant angina (ar Prinzmetal’s angina), which causes chest pain by coronary vasospasm. It typically occurs in young females, and the greatest risk factor for variant angina is smoking. Aside from smoking, affected patients often lack cardiovascular risk factors. The episodes characteristically occur at night (fram midnight to 8 am) and can be associated with transient ST elevations an ECG. The treatment of this condition invalves elimination of risk factors such as smoking, as well as pharmacologic therapy with calcium channel blockers ar nitrates. These medications work in variant angina by promoting vasodilation and preventing vasocanstriction.\n(Choice B) Monselective B-Blockers such as propranolol should be avoided in variant angina because B2 receptor inhibition can lead to worsened coronary vasospasm.\n(Choice C) Aspirin should also be avoided in variant angina because it causes prostacyclin inhibition, which may promote coronary vasospasm.\n(Choices D & F) Patients with variant angina often lack cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperchalesteralemia. Inthe absence of lipid abnormalities, variant angina management does not entail cholesterol lowering medications. If this patient's lipids were found to be abnormal on a screening test, then lipid-lowering medications could be considered.\n(Choice E) Digoxin is typically used to increase contractility in patients with congestive heart failure or as a rate control agent in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter, none of which are a problem for this patient.\n(Choice G) Heparin is an anticoagulant. Vasospasm—and not the coagulation cascade—is the cause of variant angina. Heparin plays no role in the management of uncomplicated variant angina.\n(Choice H) Streptokinase is used for thrombolysis in the treatment of a STEMI if percutaneous caranary intervention is nat rapidly available. However, this patient's presentation is more consistent with variant angina than myocardial infarction.\nEducational objective:\nPharmacologic management of variant angina invalves calcium channel blockers and/or nitrates to prevent coranary vasoconstriction. Monselective B-Blackers and aspirin should be avoided because they can promote vasocanstriction."

    "question": "A 36-year-old male patient, who has a history of Marfan's syndrome, presents with sudden onset of severe central tearing chest pain radiating to his back. The pain is 9/10 in severity and is unrelated to exertion. He denies any history of alcohol or tobacco use. Measurement of his BP shows a difference of 35 mm Hg between his two arms. Chest auscultation reveals clear lung sounds and a mid-systolic click. What is the mast appropriate next diagnostic step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Transesophageal echocardiography",
      "B. Transthoracic echocardiogram",
      "C. Cardiac enzymes",
      "D. Coronary angiogram",
      "E. Ventilation-perfusion scan"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering fram acute aortic dissection, for which transesophageal echocardiography ar computed tomagraphy of the chest are the diagnostic studies of choice. The collagen abnormalities of Marfan's syndrome predispose patients to both aortic dissection and mitral valve prolapse (as evidenced by the mid-systaolic click on the patient's cardiac exam). Tearing pain with radiation to the back and a difference in BF of greater than 30 mm Hg between the twa arms are important clinical clues to the presence af aartic dissection.\n(Choice B) TEE, CT and MRI are much mare sensitive than TTE for the diagnosis of aortic dissection. The distal ascending, transverse and descending aorta cannot be adequately visualized with TTE.\n(Choice C) Cardiac enzymes are crucial to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and it is reasonable to draw them on almost any patient with chest pain. However, this patient's age, symptoms and history of Marfan's make aortic dissection mare likely than myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, TEE is the most appropriate next step.\n(Choice D) Coronary angiography is typically performed as quickly as possible in patients with an ST elevation MI and within the first 48 hours in patients with unstable Angina/NSTEMI. As discussed above, Ml is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient. Even if there were a high suspicion far MI, ECG and cardiac enzymes should precede caronary angiography.\n(Choice E) A ventilation/perfusion scan is indicated when pulmanary embolism is suspected. Pulmonary embolism (PE) belongs in the differential for life threatening causes of chest pain. However, the chest pain of PE is typically pleuritic in nature; tearing pain with radiation to the back and a BF differential between the arms is far mare suggestive of aortic dissection.\nEducational objective:\nTearing pain with radiation to the back and a difference in BF of greater than 30 mm Hg between the arms are impartant clinical clues for aortic dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography or CT with contrast are the two diagnostic studies of choice for suspected aortic dissection."

His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg and heart rate is 75/min. Resting ECG is normal. You suspect stable angina and order an ECG stress test that reveals horizontal ST segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF at submaximal heart rate. What is the best medication to treat this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Isosorbide dinitrate",
      "B. Verapamil",
      "C. Amlodipine",

      "F. Thiazide",
      "G. Digoxin",
      "H. Clonidine"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with typical exertional angina canfirmed with ECG stress testing. Another impartant finding in this patient is hypertension. A beta-blocker is probably the best initial treatment for this patient, because it would increase the threshold far the development of an anginal episode and control the hypertension. Besides that, it is believed that beta-blockers are cardioprotective; they can potentially reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and arrhythmic episodes by decreasing the sympathetic output to the heart.\nCalcium antagonists (Choices B and C) are considered if beta-blockers are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.\nNitrates (Choice A) can cantrol anginal episodes, but they are nat good antihypertensive agents. If the effect af a beta-blocker is not satisfactory, a nitrate can be added ta the regimen.\nEnalapril (Choice E) is an antihypertensive agent without anti-anginal activity. There is some evidence that ACE inhibitors may decrease the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic heart disease not anly by lowering blood pressure, but also affecting the development of atherosclerotic plague, but this evidence is controversial.\nEducational Objective:\nIn patients who present with stable angina and hypertension, a beta-blocker is the drug of choice."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of dyspnea, fatigue, poor appetite and weight gain aver the past several weeks. He says that about four weeks ago he began to develop worsening shortness of breath with exertion and mare recently has been waking at night with breathlessness. He also notes that it is sometimes difficult for him to open his eyes in the morning due to facial edema. He has no significant past medical history and he takes no medications. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 200/120 mmHg and his heart rate is 100/min. You note generalized bodily edema and distention of his jugular veins while he is sitting upright. On lung auscultation you hear bibasilar rales. Urinalysis shows trace protein, no nitrites, trace leukocyte esterase, 50+ red blood cells and occasional neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's edema?",
    "options": [
      "A. Renal hypoperfusion",
      "B. Hypoalbuminemia",
      "C. Extensive glomerular damage",
      "D. Portal hypertension",
      "E. Hypothyroidism",
      "F. Right ventricular failure"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Peripheral edema can result fram a number of etiologies including argan failure (cardiac, hepatic, ar renal}, hypoalbuminemia (secondary to nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, ar liver disease), and venous insufficiency. The patient described above has anasarca, or generalized edema, characterized by pulmanary edema and ascites in addition to swollen extremities. Organ failure and/or hypoalbuminemia are potential causes of anasarca. Based on the information presented in the vignette, acute glomerulonephritis appears to be the unifying diagnosis here. In glomerulonephritis, edema results from glomerular damage and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nIn glamerulonephritis, the urine sediment will reveal red blood cells, red blood cell casts, and might contain white blood cells and protein as well. Patients may have significant proteinuria, which contributes to their edema. (This patient has anly trace protein on his urinalysis meaning that the majarity of his edema is secondary to a decreased GFR) Decreased GFR is the cause of edema in patients with end-stage renal disease as well.\n(Choice A) Renal hypoperfusion can occur in heart failure (decreased cardiac output), which in turn promotes increased renal sodium reabsorption and edema. Urinalysis would not show significant red blood cells ar casts.\n(Choice B) Hypoalbuminemia can result from excessive albumin loss (as in nephratic syndrome) or decreased albumin synthesis (as in cirrhosis ar severe malnutrition). While this patient clearly has renal disease, he does not have significant proteinuria to explain his presentation.\n(Choice D) Cirrhosis can cause portal hypertension as the scarred liver limits blood flow through the sinusoidal network. Patients with cirrhosis typically have ascites out of propartion to edema in other tissues, plus other signs of chranic liver disease like spider angiomata, palmar erythema, and caput medusa.\n(Choice E) While hypothyroidism can cause pretibial edema, it is not a commaon cause of anasarca.\n(Choice F) Right ventricular failure {often a consequence of left ventricular failure) is a frequent cause of peripheral edema. It manifests with an elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Of nate, isolated right ventricular failure will not cause pulmonary edema because it does not cause blood to pool in the pulmanary capillary beds.\nEducational objective:\nAnasarca typically results from organ failure ar hypoalbuminemia. In patients with glomerulonephritis, edema results from the decreased glomerular filtration rate as well as proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia in some Cases."

    "options": [
      "A. Prolonged 'PR' interval",

      "D. Presence of 'delta’ wave",
      "E. Mew-onset right bundle branch black"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has a pericardial effusion, which often causes electrical alternans on EKG. His recent upper respiratory infection is a clue towards the diagnosis, as pericardial effusions are often secondary to viral pericarditis. Accompanying pleural effusions may be found as well.\nElectrical alternans describes QRS complexes whose amplitudes vary from beat to beat on EKG. tis thought to result fram the heart's swinging back and forth within an increased quantity of pericardial fluid. Jugular venous distention, muffled heart sounds and borderline blood pressure indicate developing cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography can confirm the presence of pericardial effusion.\n(Choice A) The PR’ interval is prolonged in first degree heart block, a condition that is usually asymptomatic and requires na treatment.\n(Choice B) The presence of 'F' waves, ar flutter waves, is diagnastic of atrial flutter. Jugular venous distention and hypotension can develop if the heart rate is rapid enough, but this patient's rate is only 90.\n(Choice D) A ‘delta’ wave is an upsloping just before the QRS complex that occurs in patients with an accessory conduction pathway, like in Walf-Parkinsan-VWhite syndrome. It is not associated with pericardial effusion.\n(Choice E) Mew-onset right bundle branch block can sometimes be seen in pulmonary embolism. Pulmanary embali usually cause tachypnea and/or tachycardia.\nExplanation:\nElectrical alternans is when the amplitudes of the QRS complexes vary from beat to beat. It is fairly specific far pericardial effusion. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette can be seen an chest x-ray as well. Echocardiogram can more definitely demanstrate a pericardial effusion."

      "F. Verapamil",
      "G. Aminophylline",
      "H. Mitroglycerin"
    ],
    "answer": "H",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the setting of long-standing hypertension and a pulmanary exam cancerning for cardiogenic pulmonary edema. He has likely developed diastolic dysfunction (impaired ventricular relaxation) fram his long-standing hypertensian and is now in left ventricular failure. Mitroglycerin (MTG), either IV, sublingual, or topical, relieves the dyspnea and tachycardia associated with cardiogenic pulmanary edema by rapidly reducing preload. Several studies have suggested that it warks quicker than marphine ar loop diuretics. NTG is not part of the long-term management for patients with heart failure but can be beneficial in acutely alleviating symptoms. It should be used cautiously in patients with hypotension. Beyond NTG, loop diuretics are the mainstay of therapy for decompensated heart failure and principally wark by reducing total body volume.\n(Choice A) Beta-blockers are tremendously efficacious in treating chronic heart failure, and have been shown to significantly improve long-term morbidity and mortality in affected patients. However, beta-blockers are negative inotropes and may acutely worsen heart failure symptoms.\n(Choice B) Hydralazine given in combination with an aral nitrate has proven efficacy for treating African American men with heart failure. However, hydralazine given alone will not alleviate symptoms as quickly as NTG.\n(Choice C) Salmeterol is a long-acting B2-adrenergic agonist used in the chronic treatment of asthma and bronchodilator-responsive COPD. Because it has a slow onset, salmeterol is not beneficial in the treatment af asthma or COPD exacerbations. Regardless, this patient's wheezing is due to pulmonary edema, not asthma, sa salmeteral is not the appropriate therapy here.\n(Choice D) At moderate doses (3-10 mcg/kg/min), dopamine stimulates myocardial B-receptors and increases myocardial contractility. However, at these doses, dopamine is also arrhythmogenic and may worsen heart failure.\n(Choice E) Amiodarone can be used to treat atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in patients with heart failure but it is not a treatment for pulmonary edema.\n(Choice F) Verapamil can be used far rate contral in atrial fibrillation and to improve diastolic relaxation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, it is also a negative inotrape and may acutely worsen heart failure symptoms.\n(Choice G) Aminophylline is a bronchodilator used ta treat asthma and COPD. It is not typically recommended in heart failure.\nEducational objective:\nCardiogenic pulmanary edema results from left heart failure and is characterized by crackles on pulmonary exam. Mitroglycerin is the most rapidly acting medication ta relieve the symptoms of pulmonary edema."

    "options": [
      "A. Severe asthma",
      "B. Lobar pneumonia",
      "C. Mitral stenosis",
      "D. Aartic regurgitation",
      "E. Panic attack"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In an arterial pressure diagram, the peaks correspond to systolic pressures and the valleys to diastolic pressures. We can see that in this patient, the diastolic pressure remains relatively constant throughout the tracing, but systolic pressures drop substantially with each inspiration. Some drop in systalic pressure (<=10 mm Hg) during inspiration is normal. This physiologic drop is the result of increased venous return ta the right heart during inspiration, which impedes left ventricular filling and thus causes a drap in systalic pressure. Pulsus paradoxus is the term far an abnormally large drop in systolic blood pressure (>=12 mm Hg) with inspiration. Itis seen in some forms of cardiac disease (tamponade, pericardial effusion) and pulmanary disease (tension pneumatharax, severe asthma). In asthma, significantly elevated intrathoracic pressures during inhalation are thought to exacerbate compression of the left ventricle, causing pulsus paradoxus.\n(Choice B to E) None of these conditions typically cause pulsus paradoxus.\nEducational objective:\nPulsus paradoxus is defined as a difference in systolic blood pressure of >=12 mm Hg during inspiration. Causes include cardiac tamponade, tension pneumotharax, and severe asthma."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man complains of progressive weakness and shortness af breath over the last two weeks. He denies any chest or muscle pain, nausea, vomiting or weight loss. He had a recent upper respiratory tract infection. His heart rate is 90/min and blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg. Jugular venous pressure is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. His chest x-ray is shown below.\nWhich of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Audible fourth heart sound",
      "B. Non-palpable point of maximal impulse",
      "C. Pulsus bisferiens",
      "D. Opening snap",
      "E. Fixed splitting of the second heart sound",
      "F. Intermittent ptosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has a pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade. On chest x-ray, a large pericardial effusion may appear as an enlarged, globular-appearing cardiac shadow (the characteristic \"water bottle\" heart shape), as seen an this patient's chest x-ray. Due to the increased fluid in the pericardial space, physical exam will reveal distant heart sounds and a non-palpable pulse at the cardiac apex or paint of maximal impulse.\nIt is important to recognize that this patient does nat have cardiac tamponade. Tamponade presents as hypotension, right heart failure (distended jugular veins), and tachycardia. Fulsus paradoxus may be present. The therapy for cardiac tamponade is vigorous volume resuscitation and pericardiocentesis.\n(Choice A) &n audible fourth heart sound is heard in normal, young patients and in people with left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient's chest x-ray is more cansistent with a pericardial effusion than left ventricular hypertrophy, which often appears as a \"boot-shaped\" cardiac shadow on x-ray.\n(Choice C) Pulsus bisferiens, ar biphasic pulse, refers to two strong systolic impulses with a midsystalic dip. It can be seen in aortic regurgitation with or without aortic stenosis and in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.\n(Choice D) An opening snap is heard with mitral stenosis. Significant mitral stenosis will cause left atrial enlargement. This will be seen on chest x-ray as a straightening of the left part of the cardiac silhouette {as apposed to the normal mild concavity visible below the pulmanary artery shadow). Enlargement of the entire cardiac silhouette would not be seen.\n(Choice E) Fixed splitting of the second heart sound is associated with atrial septal defects.\n(Choice F) Intermittent ptosis wauld be seen if this patient had myasthenia gravis in assaciation with thymoma. These tumars present as anterior mediastinal masses on chest x-ray with preserved cardiac size. This chest x-ray is not consistent with a thymoma.\nEducational Objective:\nPericardial effusions will appear as an enlarged, \"water bottle\" shaped cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. Physical exam findings of pericardial effusions without cardiac tamponade include diminished heart sounds on auscultation and a difficult to palpate point of maximal impulse."

    "question": "A 66-year-ald white male presents to his primary care physician for follow-up evaluation of high blood pressure noted on each of three prior visits over a period of 6 months (systolic blood pressure ranging 140-145, diastolic blood pressure ranging 90-96 mm Hg). He has smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years and takes 5-8 drinks of alcohol daily. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications. There is no family history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia ar hypertension. On physical examination today, his blood pressure is 146/97 mm Hg and pulse is 80/min. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. Which of the following nonpharmacaologic interventions would be expected to have the greatest impact on his high blood pressure?",
    "options": [
      "A. Smoking cessation",
      "B. Increased consumption of complex carbohydrates",
      "C. Increased calcium consumption",
      "D. Decreased alcohol intake",
      "E. Decreased consumption of animal protein"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has had multiple blood pressure readings greater than 140/90 aver a period of manths, and therefore meets the criteria for stage I hypertension. In such patients, it is reasonable ta enact a trial of lifestyle madifications to reduce blood pressure before resorting to medications. The most effective lifestyle intervention for reducing blood pressure is decreased consumption of alcohol. It is recommended that males consume less than 2 drinks daily, and women less than 1.\n(Choice A) There is no question that smoking cessation reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. However, in terms of improving hypertension itself, abstinence from alcohal has a greater effect.\n(Choice B) Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whale grains have been shown to aid weight loss and may therefare indirectly help lower blood pressure. Decreasing alcohal consumption would be expected to have a mare dramatic effect, however.\n(Choice C) Patients with a low dietary intake of calcium do have a higher risk of developing hypertension, but qiving these patients calcium supplements has not been shawn to substantially impact blood pressure.\n(Choice E) Vegetarians tend to have less hypertension than meat-eaters, but there is not strong data to suggest that eliminating animal protein from the diet is an effective means of controlling hypertension.\nEducational objective:\nLifestyle modification should be the first-line intervention for newly diagnosed stage 1 hypertension. Reduction of alcohol and sodium intake, weight loss, and aerobic exercise can all decrease blood pressure. Quitting smoking will decrease a patient's risk of cardiovascular disease, but does nat improve blood pressure itself."

      "D. Chaolesterol embali",
      "E. Superior vena cava syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's coal, dusky fingertips are the result of norepinephrine-induced vasospasm. Morepinephrine has alpha-1 agonist properties which cause vasoconstriction; this property is useful when trying to increase the blood pressure of hypotensive patients. However, in some patients with decreased blood flaw, vasocanstriction can result in ischemia and necrasis of the distal fingers and toes. A similar phenomenan can occur in the intestines (resulting in mesenteric ischemia) or kidney (causing renal failure).\n(Choice A) Endocarditis can spread septic embali throughout the body, but would not be expected to affect all fingers.\n(Choice B) Raynaud's phenomenon is a cause of finger ischemia that typically progresses from pallor to cyanosis to erythema. It can be accompanied by pain and is usually due to cold exposure ar stress. The duskiness of the fingers pictured above, hawever is more suggestive of ischemia.\n(Choice D) Cholesterol embali can occur in patients with atherosclerosis and can affect the distal portions of the digits, thus its occasional name \"blue toe syndrome \" However, symmetrical involvement of all digits would be unusual.\n(Choice E) Superior vena cava syndrome occurs in patients with lung cancer, thrombi, ar fibrosing mediastinitis and can cause upper extremity edema. However, arterial flow is preserved and so ischemia does not occur.\nEducational objective:\nFressaors such as norepinephrine can cause ischemia of the distal fingers and toes secondary to vasospasm. The diagnosis is suggested by symmetric duskiness and coolness af all fingertips."

    "options": [
      "A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "B. Coronary atherosclerosis",
      "C. Aortic aneurysm rupture",
      "D. Ventricular septal defect",
      "E. Bicuspid aorta"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Sudden cardiac death in a young individual, especially during exertion, is most common with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is mare camman in African-Americans than whites. Mast of the patients who die suddenly from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have had no prior symptoms. Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can occur in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The generation of these arrhythmias is multifactorial, but all derive from the underlying abnormality of abnormal myocytes and myocardial scarring. Death can also occur in these patients fram heart failure and stroke as well, but these would be unlikely to cause such a sudden death.\n(Answer B) Coronary atherosclerosis can lead to myocardial infarction, which can produce the sudden anset af ventricular arrhythmias resulting in death. However, the extremely young age and lack of any significant past medical history make this unlikely for this patient.\n(Answer C) Aartic aneurysms in a patient of this age are rare. In the general population, they are usually due to atherosclerosis, which this patient would be unlikely to have.\n(Answer D) Ventricular septal defects are often a congenital disorder and would be possible in this patient. However, they are not a cause of sudden death. If the patient were ta die from complications of a ventricular septal defect, he would likely have some symptoms beforehand.\n(Answer E) A bicuspid aorta is a congenital condition that can lead to aortic stenosis. However, patients typically have symptoms of the condition and they usually develop at a later age. Bicuspid aortic valve would therefore be an unlikely cause of sudden death in this patient.\nEducational objective:\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy can lead to ventricular arrhythmias, and should be suspected in a sudden death af an atherwise healthy young individual."

    "options": [
      "A. BP is within acceptable range",
      "B. BP is within optimal range",
      "C. It is better to keep systolic pressure less than 130 mmHg to slow end-organ damage",
      "D. Diastolic BF is within acceptable range, but systolic is not",
      "E. Systolic BP is within acceptable range, but diastolic is not"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Traditionally a goal, blood pressure is considered to be below 140/90 mmHg. But it is recently recognized that BP needs more tight contral in diabetics and patients with chranic renal failure. These two groups of patients are especially sensitive to high BP, that's why the values of systolic BF for these patients should be kept lower than 130 mmHg and diastolic BF lower than 80 mmHg to prevent end argan damage.\nBlood pressure could be considered in acceptable range (Choice A) if the patient was not diabetic. According to JNC-7 report (JNC stands far Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) BF is considered optimal when it is below 120/80 mmHg (Choice B) In this patient both systolic (Choice E) and diastolic (Choice D) BFP are above the goal values.\nEducational objective:\nIt is better to keep systolic pressure <= 130 mmHg to slow end-organ damage in patients with diabetes and chronic renal failure."

He has a five year history of bronchial asthma for which he uses an albuterol inhaler. He says that he uses the inhaler an average of two times per week during the day. In addition, he states that his asthma symptoms wake him from sleep approximately 3-4 times per month. He does not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. His family histary is significant for asthma in his grandfather. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?",

      "B. Add inhaled corticosteroids",
      "C. Add aral theophylline",
      "D. Add oral prednisone",
      "E. Continue current medical regimen"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The proper pharmacologic treatment of asthma varies depending on the severity of symptoms. Asthma is classified into four categaries: intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent. The category is determined by assessing the frequency of a patient's daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, use of short-term beta agonists, and pulmanary function testing. The criteria for each category are as follows:\nIntermittent: daytime symptoms <= 2x/week, nighttime awakenings <= 2x/maonth, beta agonists <= 2x/week, normal baseline FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, and no limitations an daily activities.\nMild persistent: symptoms >2 days/week but not daily, nighttime awakenings 3-4x/month, minor limitation an activities, and normal PF Ts.\nModerate persistent: symptoms daily, weekly nighttime awakenings, moderate limitation on activities, and FEV1 60-80% of predicted.\nSevere persistent: symptoms throughout the day, frequent nighttime awakenings, extremely limited activity, and FEV1 <=60% predicted.\nThe patient in the above vignette is prescribed anly a short-acting beta-2 agonist (albuteral), which would be AanmmrArriatre tharame Far infarritHtant acta Havsonsasr he hace 3-4 nighttime awakenings per manth, cansistent with mild persistent asthma. Therefore, continuing the current medical regimen (Choice E) would be insufficient. Proper treatment for mild persistent asthma includes a PRN albuteral inhaler plus inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, Choice B is correct.\nIn addition to a FRM albuterol inhaler and low-dase inhaled corticosteroids, patients with moderate persistent asthma should receive a long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist inhaler (Choice A).\nPatients with severe persistent asthma should receive a PRM albuteral inhaler, long-acting beta-2 agonist inhaler, and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Oral prednisone (Choice D) can also be used in cases of severe persistent asthma.\nEducational objective:\nProper treatment of mild persistent asthma includes a PRM albuterol inhaler and inhaled corticosteroids."

      "D. High serum anion gap",
      "E. High serum albumin level"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "While being mechanically ventilated this patient is vulnerable to farced hyper- or hypoventilation. Ventilation is defined as the tidal volume multiplied by the respiratory rate. Hyperventilation {caused by increased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate) results in excessive CO2 losses and respiratory alkalosis, while hypoventilation (caused by decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate) results in CO2 retention and respiratory acidosis. The patient described is experiencing respiratory alkalosis as evidenced by his increased arterial blood pH (normal = 7.4) and his decreased PaCO2 (normal = 40 mmHg). His serum bicarbonate level is decreased due to attempted renal compensation for the metabolic alkalosis. Specifically, the kidneys retain increased amounts of H+ (protons) and excrete increased amounts of bicarbonate (HCO3-) in an attempt to normalize the serum pH. The increased amount of HCO3- in the urine alkalinizes the urine.\n(Choice A) Renal compensation for respiratory or metabolic acidosis involves low urine bicarbonate excretion.\n(Choice C) Increased serum aldosterone would result in increased H+ and K+ losses in the urine and serum alkalosis. \"Contraction alkalosis\" occurs in states of intracellular volume contraction, where increased levels af aldosterone function to restore intravascular valume but also cause increased urinary proton loss.\n(Choice D) A high serum anion gap occurs in metabolic acidoses resulting from diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure, lactic acidosis, and methanol, ethylene glycal or salicylate poisoning.\n(Choice E) A high serum albumin level may indicate hemaocancentration, as occurs in dehydration.\nEducational objective:\nThe kidney compensates for respiratory alkalosis by preferentially excreting bicarbonate in the urine. The result is an alkalinized urine (increased urine pH)."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) based on his classic clinical presentation (chronic cough, hemoptysis, intermittent fevers), his recent travel fram a country where TB is endemic, and his chest CT with twa right upper lobe cavitary lesions with surrounding alveolar infiltration. Reactivation of pulmonary TB typically causes upper lobe cavitations. This patient should be treated with four drug therapy for active TB.\n(Choice A) Bronchiectasis is progressive branchial dilation, cyst formation, poor mucus clearance, and secretion pooling that results from severe repeated airway inflammation. CT scans show bronchial thickening, nat upper lobe cavitation.\n(Choice C) Lung cancer can cause a chronic cough but typically appears as a salitary, dense nodule an chest CT. This patient, on the other hand, has two cavitary lesions. Moreover, he is relatively young to develop a primary lung cancer.\n(Choice D) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABFA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus colonization of the bronchi. It occurs most commonly in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis and presents with fever, malaise, productive cough, eosinophilia, and hemoptysis.\n(Choice E) Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that most cammanly affects the lungs. Perihilar lymphadenopathy is the typical finding but patients may also develop interstitial lung disease and pulmanary fibrosis. Cavitary lesions are uncommon.\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary tuberculosis presents with productive cough, hemoptysis, and recurrent fevers. Weight loss may also be present.

    "question": "A 33-year-old male was invalved in a motor vehicle accident with numerous rib fractures. His course in the hospital was complicated by difficulty with deep breathing and later developed pneumonia. The chest x-ray later confirmed that the patient had developed a parapneumaonic effusion. Which ane of the following laboratory tests an the pleural fluid is currently thought to be mast helpful in determining the need for chest tube placement in parapneumanic effusion?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lactate dehydrogenase",
      "B. WBC count",
      "C. Pleural fluid pH",
      "D. Tatal protein",
      "E. Color of the pleural fluid"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Farapneumanic effusions usually occur from pneumania. The fluid may be sterile in the initial stages and resalve with antibiotic therapy; however, in a few cases, the patient will continue to have elevated temperatures, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. CT scan will identify the fluid collection. The fluid may be aspirated to determine if empyema has set in. The aspirated fluid should always be analyzed for the protein content (exudates have more than transudates), gram stain, cell count, cytology (rule out malignancy), and glucose levels (low in rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, empyema, malignancy, and esophageal rupture). The pH of the fluid should always be assessed. Low pH (<= 7.2) is almost always indicative of an empyema and indicates removal of the fluid by thoracostomy (Choice C). Glucose of less than 60mg/dL is also an indication far tube thoracostamy.\n(Choice A) Lactate dehydrogenase is generally higher in exudates than in transudates, but does nat indicate if an empyema has accurred. LOH levels are elevated in a number of conditions, including myocardial infarction, cirrhosis, and generalized ischemia.\n(Choice B) WBC count is essential to determine the presence of neutrophils ar lymphocytes. Elevated levels af lymphocytes are seen in tuberculosis effusions and lymphomas. These findings da nat always indicate an infected pleural space. Elevated levels of neutrophils almost always signify an infected fluid.\n(Choice D) Total protein may be elevated in almost all exudative effusions. The level of protein in transudates is much lower than in exudates. Protein is elevated in neoplasms, tuberculosis, and other infectious effusions. However, the protein content does not determine the need for a chest tube.\n(Choice E) The colar of the pleural effusion does not determine the need for drainage. The effusions in nan-infectious causes are generally clear, and, in infectious, may be cloudy. Hemarrhagic effusions are bloody in nature, and a ruptured thoracic duct will reveal a milky white effusion.\nEducational Objective:\nWhen the pH of the pleural fluid is less than 7.2, the probability is very high that this fluid needs to be drained. Glucose of less than 60mg/dL in pleural fluid is alsa an indication for tube thoracostomy. Infected pleural space is usually initially drained with a chest tube."

    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of daytime sleepiness. He says that he often falls asleep during meetings, watching TV, and even while driving his car. He does not feel refreshed after his daytime naps, and has not experienced vivid hallucinations when falling asleep or upon awakening. He has occasional morning headaches and his wife complains that he sometimes keeps her up at night. Physical exam reveals a body mass index (BMI) of 31.3 kg/m2. An arterial blood gas is normal.

    "options": [
      "A. Narcolepsy",
      "B. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome",
      "C. Obstructive sleep apnea",
      "D. Central sleep apnea",
      "E. Primary insomnia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has several classic signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a phenomenon of nocturnal hypoventilation. There are two types of abnormal ventilation during sleep: 1) apnea (cessation of breathing for >= 10 seconds) or 2) hypopnea (reduced airflow causing Sa02 to decrease by >= 4%). The most comman cause for bath of these in the United States is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a transient upper airway obstruction due to poor pharyngeal muscle tone. In OSA, the patient continues to contract the diaphragm in an attempt to breathe, but airflow is impeded by upper airway obstruction. OSA is the most common medical cause of excessive daytime sleepiness in this country, affecting over seven million people. Risk factors for OSA include obesity, tonsillar hypertrophy, and hypothyroidism. Men are more frequently affected than women. Typical symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, impotence, poor judgment, and depression. Bed partners may be kept awake by snoring, as in this vignette. Physical exam often reveals obesity and increased soft tissue in the oropharynx. Lab studies may reveal erythrocytasis. Chronic OSA can lead to pulmanary hypertension and right ventricular failure.\n(Choice A) Narcolepsy Is a sleep disorder characterized by poorly regulated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It, like OSA, is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, but patients also suffer from cataplexy, sleep attacks, hypnagagic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.\n(Choice B) Obesity hypoventilation syndrame (OHS), alsa called the Pickwickian Syndrome, occurs when obesity impedes the expansion of the chest and abdominal wall during breathing. This leads to increased respiratory work and decreased respiratory drive. OHS is characterized by underventilation of the lungs during all hours, leading to a chronically elevated FaCO2 and reduced PaQ2. Therefore, this patient's normal arterial blood gas is not consistent with OHS. Eventually, as in OSA, polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure can result. Notably, patients with OHS often have concomitant obstructive sleep apnea.\n(Choice D) In contrast to obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea occurs when the patient's central drive to initiate breaths is absent. Thus, it is caused by a neurologic rather than mechanical problem. This patient's presentation is not consistent with central sleep apnea.\nEducational Objective:\nObstructive sleep apnea is the most common medical cause of excessive daytime sleepiness inthe US. It occurs due to poor oropharyngeal tone and results in daytime sleepiness, marning headaches, and depression."

      "C. Tachycardia",
      "D. Hypoxia",
      "E. Normal Pco2"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "In determining the severity of an asthma attack, it is very impartant in choosing an appropriate management tactic. Marmal Pco2 is ane of the indicators of a severe attack. During asthma exacerbation, hyperventilation (tachypnea) is usually present, and the wark of breathing is increased. Po2 is usually depressed (but 68 is not bad) because of the V/Q mismatch (Choice D), and tachypnea is usually present (Choice B). At the same time, Pco2 is decreased due to hyperventilation. Normal to increased Pco2 values indicates CO2 retention because of severe airway obstruction (air trapping) and/or respiratory muscle fatigue. Other indicatars of severe attack include speech difficulty, diaphoresis, altered sensorium, cyanosis, and ‘silent’ lungs. Lung hyperinflation (Choice A) and tachycardia (Choice C) are typical findings during an asthma attack and are not indicators of severity.\nEducational Objective:\nIndicators of a severe asthma attack include normal to increased Pco2 values, speech difficulty, diapharesis, altered sensorium, cyanosis, and silent’ lungs."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Exercise-induced asthma is the mast likely diagnosis here. Asthma is an intermittent obstructive airway disease characterized by dyspnea, cough and wheezing following exposure to various triggers. Atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis are commanly associated conditions. In exercise-induced asthma, the trigger is high minute ventilation of dry, cold air, which stimulates mast cell degranulation and airway canstriction. Beta agonists and mast cell stabilizers are both important in the management of exercise-induced asthma. Shart-acting beta-adrenergic agonists used 20 minutes prior to exercise are typically sufficient to prevent symptoms and are considered first-line therapy. Long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists may be used in children or athletes wha engage in athletic activities throughout the day.\n(Choice B) Daily oral steroids are indicated only for severe persistent asthma, which is characterized by cantinuous daytime symptoms, frequent nighttime symptoms, and an FEV less than 60% of predicted.\n(Choice C) Daily steroid inhalers are the preferred treatment far mild persistent asthma, which is characterized by mare than two episodes per week and mare than two nighttime episodes per manth.\n(Choice D) Daily oral theophylline may be used as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for any form of asthma other than mild intermittent.\n(Choice E) Ipratropium inhalers are often combined with beta-adrenergic agonists for an additive bronchodilator effect. Ipratropium is mare effective in patients with COPD than in those with asthma.\nEducational objective:\nShort-acting beta-adrenergic agonists administered 20 minutes befare exercise are the first-line treatment for isolated exercise-induced asthma. The inciting trigger in exercise-induced asthma is rapid ventilation of cold, dry air."

    "question": "A 34-year-old male is rushed to the emergency room with severe respiratory distress. He is agitated and gasping far breath. He has been seen in the ER several times before for difficulty breathing, food intolerances and skin allergies. Physical examination is notable for excessive accessory respiratory muscle use, retraction of the subclavicular fossae during inspiration, and scattered urticaria over the upper body. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Upper airway obstruction",
      "B. Asthma exacerbation",
      "C. Pneumaotharax",
      "D. Eosinophilic pneumonia",
      "E. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This is a patient with acute-onset dyspnea and clinical features suggestive of upper respiratory abstruction. Given his history of food allergies and urticaria, laryngeal edema is likely the cause of his respiratory symptoms. Patients with laryngeal edema typically present with acute-onset dyspnea. There is usually an identifiable precipitating event, e.g. peanut ingestion in a patient with a history of peanut allergies. Physical examination will reveal stridor and harsh respiratory sounds from the trachea. Wheezing is generally absent on lung auscultation.\n(Choice B) Asthma exacerbations generally do not come on with the sort of catastrophic acuity described here. On exam, there will be scattered wheezes over the lung fields rather than stridor, differentiating asthma fram upper respiratory obstruction.\n(Choice C) Like in patients with laryngeal edema, patients with pneumothorax present with acute-onset dyspnea. However, stridor and wheezing are absent. In fact, breath sounds are absent altogether an the side of the pneumothorax. Chest percussion an the side of the pneumothorax will reveal a tympanitic note.\n(Choice D) In eosinophilic pneumonia, symptom onset is gradual. Patients generally present with asthma-like symptoms angaing far several days. On physical examination, there are diffuse wheezes and fine inspiratory crackles suggestive of bronchial and interstitial involvement. Peripheral eosinophilia is also present.\n(Choice E) Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is characterized by prominent cutaneous manifestations. Pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions can accur but symptoms are slow to evalve compared to those described in the above vignette.\nEducational objective:\nIn a patient presenting with sudden anset of severe shortness of breath with stridor and coarse upper respiratory sounds, laryngeal edema is the mast likely diagnosis and the patient should be managed as such."

    "question": "A 57-year-old male was invalved in a motor vehicle accident and was immediately brought to the Emergency Room. He suffered minar head and neck injury, but was found to have a broken tibia. He underwent repair of the tibial fracture the following day. Five days later, he suddenly develops tachycardia and is tachypneic. He complains of increasing chest discomfort and has a syncopal episode. His blood pressure is 80/55 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 24/min. Pulse oximetry showed 82% on room air. Stat echocardiogram reveals obstruction in the main pulmonary artery. Which of the following choices is the most appropriate course of action?",
    "options": [
      "A. Heparin infusion",
      "B. Fibrinolytic therapy",
      "C. Embolectomy",
      "D. Inferior vena cava filter"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Pulmonary embolism can present acutely with a sudden onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. If there is hemodynamic compromise and the clot is situated in the main pulmonary artery, the best treatment aptian is to perform a pulmonary embaolectomy. A pulmonary embaolectomy can be perfarmed either surgically ar percutaneausly. The clot is pulled out and most patients da well. Making the diagnosis is the mast important thing. Even after an embolectomy, the patient may require warfarin (coumadin) far a few months (Choice C).\n(Choice A) Heparin is a good choice, but does not dissolve the clot. In addition, it does not improve the hemodynamics immediately. In the past, the majority of these patients died from shock. Heparin can be started, and the patient taken to the operating room.\n(Choice B) Fibrinalytic therapy is an excellent chaice, but nat in a fresh postoperative patient, especially after trauma. It may cause diffuse bleeding, which can result in death.\n(Choice D) A vena cava filter is generally placed when a patient has recurrent DVT occurrence or when there is a contraindication to heparin. These devices can be placed percutaneously either via the jugular ar femaral vein and are always placed below the renal vein.\nEducational Objective:\nWhen an acute pulmonary embolus occurs with hemodynamic compromise, the best treatment is fibrinalytic therapy. But, if the patient has contraindications to the use of fibrinolytic therapy, an embolectomy is the treatment of choice."

    "question": "A 60-year-old man comes to the office with worsening shortness of breath over the last 5 months. He has had two episodes of bronchitis over the last 12 months. He now has a mild nonproductive cough. He denies any fever, chills, hemoptysis, chest pain, or difficulty breathing while lying on his back. His medications include an ipratropium inhaler, aspirin, and amlodipine. He was hospitalized twice in the last 3 years due to an exacerbation of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day far the last 40 years. His temperature is 99 F (37.2 C), blood pressure is 130/86 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 18/min. Examination shows a thin man in mild respiratory distress with increased anteroposterior chest diameter, diffuse expiratory wheeze and loud S2. Chest X-ray shows hyperinflation of bilateral lung fields with diaphragm flattening and small heart size. Which of the following is the most effective measure to decrease mortality in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Adding a short acting beta-agonist inhaler",
      "B. Adding an inhaled corticosteroid",
      "C. Adding a long-acting beta agonist",
      "D. Adding systemic corticosteroids",
      "E. Smoking cessation",
      "F. Adding prophylactic antibiotics"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient mast likely has emphysema, which is a permanent destruction of the airways without obvious fibrasis. Both chronic bronchitis and emphysema are very common in individuals wha have an extensive smoking history. While 10-15% of smokers develop COPD, about 80-90 % of patients with COFD are smokers. Smaking cessation and home oxygen therapy are the only two treatments currently available that have been shown to decrease mortality in patients with COPD.\n(Choice A) Short acting beta-agonists like albuteral have a quick onset of action and imprave lung function and symptoms in the shart term, but have not been shown to decrease mortality. They should be used as second-line drugs in combination with inhaled anticholinergic agents.\n(Choice B) Although inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to decrease the number of COPD exacerbations and imprave quality of life they have no mortality benefit.\n(Choice C) Long acting beta-agonists are used in patients with more advanced disease. They do provide improved quality of life and better symptom contral, but do not alter mortality.\n(Choice D) Systemic corticosteroids are useful on a short term basis during acute exacerbations of COFD, but should not be used long term due ta their significant adverse effects.\n(Choice F) Antibiotics are useful in patients with acute COPD exacerbations, but chronic antibiotics are not indicated. Antibiotics do nat effect martality.\nEducational objective:\nIn all patients with COPD, the two modalities that have been shown to decrease mortality are home oxygen therapy and smoking cessation."

    "question": "A 68-year-old female comes to the Emergency Room with increased shortness of breath and cough for 12 hours. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for the past 14 years and has been oxygen dependent far two years. Twelve hours ago, she felt unable to get her breath. She took two extra nebulizer treatments and used her as-needed inhaler with no relief of symptoms. She denies any fever, chills, sweating, nausea ar vomiting, and hemoptysis. She rarely uses alcohal, but had smoked two packs/day for 45 years. She quit smoking about six years aga. Her medications include ipratropium, albuteral, multivitamins, and oxygen 2 liters/min by nasal cannula. She is a thin, frail female in moderate distress. Her temperature is 36.7C (98F), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 28/min. Pulse oximetry shows 84% on 2 liters oxygen by nasal cannula. The patient is given oxygen, methyl prednisolone, aerosolized ipratropium, and albuteral; however, the patient remains dyspneic and bedridden. ABGs are ordered and the results show: pH 7.32, PCO2 60 mmHg, and PO2 52 mmHg on 4-liters O2. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increase oxygen by nasal cannula",
      "B. Decrease oxygen",
      "C. Intubate and mechanically ventilate the patient",
      "D. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation",
      "E. Aminophylline"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is having an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which at this stage is refractary to the standard initial management of corticosteroids and aerosolized bronchodilators. However, the patient is not crashing. In such patients there is a consensus to use non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) ahead of intubation. NIPPV is associated with decrease complications that are a hallmark af intubation, which includes infections. NIPFV is recommended in a patient of respiratory distress with a pH<=7.35 or PaCO2 >45 mmHg or respiratory rate >25 per min. There is better alveolar ventilation and less fatigue of respiratory muscles by using NIPFY. However, in septic, hypotensive, or dysrhythmic patients, NIPPV is contraindicated (Choice D).\nThe patient is already on oxygen therapy, but she is hypercapnic as well as acidotic. In such cases, increasing oxygen alone will reduce the respiratory drive. In COPD patients, PCO2 is elevated at baseline and it does not stimulate the respiratory center, unlike in narmal individuals. Their only drive ta increase the respiratory rate is hypoxia. If you just provide oxygen, it, in fact, worsens the situation. You should provide NIPPY to provide mare oxygen and to wash out the CO2 (Choice A).\nDecreasing oxygen (Choice B) is certainly going ta cause mare harm. You should provide the oxygen in a mare appropriate way, such as NIFFY, rather than nasal cannula.\nIt is always better to avoid intubation, if possible, because of various complications associated with it. Intubation results in increased incidence of nosocomial infections, which increases long-term mortality in these patients (Choice C). However, if the patient does not respond to MIFFY, then intubation should be considered.\nAminaphylline is proven to be inferiar to a combination of bronchodilator and corticosteroids for the treatment af acute exacerbation of COPD (Choice E).\nEducational Objective:\nMIPPY is an excellent aption far patients with COPD exacerbation. It should be tried befare intubation and mechanical ventilation in COPD patients with CO2 retention."

    "question": "A 67-year-old white male with a long histary of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency roam complaining of acute anset of shortness of breath far the last 30 minutes. He says that for the past 2 or 3 days he has been having some difficulty breathing and a productive cough with thick phlegm, but nothing as bad as the current episode. He also has a history of congestive heart failure after suffering a myocardial infarction for which he is taking furosemide and lisinopril. While talking to you in halting sentences, you note that he appears cyanotic, confused and is sweating profusely. He normally takes albuterol, ipratropium and budesonide inhalers for his breathing difficulties, but they have not relieved his current symptoms. On examination, he is found to be markedly dyspneic and his PaO2 is 55 mm Hg. A chest x-ray done in the ER is shown below.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Start intravenous theophylline",
      "B. Urgent thoracocentesis",
      "C. Urgent bronchoscopy",
      "D. Place central venous line",
      "E. Increase furosemide and start digoxin"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has a complete left lung collapse, seen as a complete opacification of the left lung on the x-ray. The leftward shift of the mediastinum indicated that the lung has collapsed due to volume loss (atelectasis), which has caused the mediastinum to be pulled toward the affected side. This most commanly results from bronchial obstruction, which can be caused by mucus plugging, tumar, foreign body or external compression. Obstruction of a mainstem bronchus can cause respiratory distress resulting in dyspnea, tachypnea and diaphoresis. The resulting hypoxia causes confusion and cyanosis. This patient requires urgent bronchoscopy for diagnosis and possibly treatment of his underlying obstructing lesion. Removal of secretions ar mucus plugs is associated with rapid improvement in PaO2 and quick symptomatic relief.\n(Choice A) Theophylline is a xanthine derivative uncommanly used to treat acute bronchoconstriction in asthma; it is not indicated far complete collapse of the lung.\n(Choice B) The patient does not have a tension pneumothorax or pleural effusion; therefore, a thoracocentesis is not required.\n(Choice D) A central venous line is indicated for patients requiring volume replacement ar intravenous medications. This patient has no signs of hemorrhage.\n(Choice E) The chest x-ray does not show pulmanary edema, despite this patient's histary of heart failure, so there is no need to add diuretics.\nEducational objective:\nOpacification of a single lung with shifting of the mediastinum toward the affected lung indicates a collapsed lung due to atelectatic volume loss. Urgent bronchoscopy is required to identify and possibly treat the abstructing bronchial lesion."

      "H. Pulmanary hypertensian",
      "I. Viral pneumania"
    ],
    "answer": "H",
    "explanation": "The physical findings in this patient are suggestive of pulmanary hypertension. Pulmanary hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 25 mmHg at rest ar 30 mmHg with exercise. It is seen following the narrowing of the precapillary vessels, the loss of the pulmanary capillary bed, or passive backpressure from the post capillary vessels from any cause. It can be classified as follows:\n1. Pulmonary hypertension associated with disorders of the respiratory system, hypoxemia, or both.\n2. Pulmonary hypertension due ta pulmonary venous hypertension (left ventricular heart disease, mitral valve disease, or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease).\n3. Pulmonary hypertension following chronic thromboembolic disease.\n4. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (primary pulmanary hypertension, pulmonary hypertension associated with vasculopathy).\n5. Pulmonary hypertension due to disorders directly affecting the pulmonary vasculature (pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis).\nThe clinical features of pulmonary hypertension remain the same regardless of the underlying cause. Dyspnea, weakness, and fatigue are early complaints, which may be followed by chest pain, hemaptysis, syncape, or hoarseness (due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve). Right ventricular failure develops late in the disease and manifests with right ventricular heave, jugular venous distension, tender hepatomegaly, ascites, edema, etc. Chest x-ray would shaw enlargement of the pulmanary arteries with rapid tapering of the distal vessels (pruning) and enlargement of the right ventricle. An EKG may show right axis deviation, which is secondary to right ventricular strain and hypertrophy due to pulmonary hypertension. Untreated pulmonary hypertension would eventually lead to Cor pulmonale.\nThis patient mast likely has primary (idiopathic) pulmonary hypertension.\n(Choices A, B, and C) All these options can cause secondary pulmanary hypertension: however, you will see signs and symptoms of pulmonary venous congestion.\n(Choices D and E) Emphysema and bronchitis are unlikely since she is young and a nonsmaoker. A chest ®-ray will be different.\n(Choice G) Scleroderma would cause pulmanary fibrosis, which eventually leads to secondary pulmonary hypertension.\nEducational Objective:\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension can be seen in middle-aged patients, and it presents with exertional breathlessness. Lungs will be clear to auscultation. Chest x-ray would show enlargement of the pulmonary arteries with rapid tapering of the distal vessels (pruning) and enlargement of the right ventricle."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely having Klebsiella pneumonia, also known as Friedlander's pneumonia. Gram-negative bacilli accounts far = 2% of cammunity-acquired pneumania, but account far most of the nosocomial infection and have high mortality rates. Some of the comman gram-negative bacteria (GMB) causing pneumonia are E.coli, Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Proteus, Serratia marcescens and Acinetobacter. GMB pneumanias are rare in healthy individuals and usually occur in infants, the elderly, alcohalics, and an immunacompromised host, especially with neutropenia. The usual pathophysiclogical mechanism is colonization of the oropharynx, followed by micro aspiration of upper airway secretions.\nFriedlander's pneumonia aor Klebsiella pneumaonia most frequently affect the upper lobe and produce currant jelly-like sputum with tissue necrosis and early abscess formation and a fulminant course. Klebsiella is ane af the most common organisms responsible for pneumania in alcoholics (Choice C). It is an encapsulated GMB and grows as mucoid colonies.\n(Choice A) E. coliis a non-capsulated gram-negative bacillus. It generally causes nosocomial pneumonia. However, in alcoholics, Klebsiella is much mare common.\n(Choice B) 5. Pneumaniae is the mast comman organism for cammunity-acquired pneumania; however it appears as gram-positive cocci in pairs.\n(Choice D) Legionella is also a gram-negative bacillus and is generally seen following contamination of a water supply with aerosolized arganisms. Alcoholics can develop Legionella pneumania; however, it is not an encapsulated organism and does not produce mucoid colonies.\n(Choice E) Mycoplasma is a common cause of atypical community-acquired pneumonia. Gram stain of expectorated sputum would show sparse bacteria, a mixture of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells, and clumps of desquamated respiratory epithelial cells.\n(Choice F) Pseudomonas is also a gram-negative bacillus and a very common cause of nosocomial infection. It is generally seen in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, advanced AIDS, bronchiectasis, and pneumonias acquired in intensive care. tis also an encapsulated organism.\nEducational Objective:\nKlebsiella is an encapsulated gram-negative bacillus and can cause pneumonia in subjects with debilitating conditions, especially alcoholics. Friedlander's pneumonia generally affects the upper lobe and is characterized by currant jelly-like sputum."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The respiratory findings in this patient are suggestive of bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis along with infertility in a young adult with history of recurrent respiratary infection is suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis is a comman finding in cystic fibrosis patients and may be the only finding in adults. Bronchiectasis secondary to cystic fibrosis is often limited to the upper lobe and sputum generally grows pseudomaonas. The chest x-ray findings of dilated and thickened airway (Tram Track pattern) and irregular peripheral opacities (due to mucopurulent plugs) supparts the diagnosis of bronchiectasis.\nCystic fibrosis is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians caused by mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein found in all exocrine tissues, leading to abnormal chlaride transportation and thick exocrine secretions. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is made an the basis of compatible clinical findings with laboratory confirmation. Sweat chloride test is the gold standard test for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Sweat chloride concentration >= 60 mEq/L is almost diagnostic of cystic fibrosis.\n(Choice B) Malecular diagnosis based an direct mutation analysis may be used for canfirmation af cystic fibrosis; however, there are several number of mutations (mare than 1,250) leading to cystic fibrosis, and the sensitivity is less than 90% even when tested for 20-30 of the mast commaon mutations. Thus, sweat chloride test is still preferred over molecular diagnosis.\n(Choice C) Fulmonary function tests may show the obstructive pattern, but they are not useful in diagnosing the cystic fibrosis.\nEducational Objective:\nThe diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is made on the basis of compatible clinical findings with laboratory confirmation. Sweat chloride test (>=60 mEg/L) is the gold standard test far diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and preferred over direct mutation analysis as more than 1,250 mutations in CFTR can lead to cystic fibrosis."

      "E. Compression stockings"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Proximal deep vein thromboses (DVTs) require treatment ta prevent acute pulmonary embolism (FE). Most patients are treated acutely with heparin and then managed with warfarin aver the long-term. However, there are absolute contraindications to anticoagulation including recent surgery, hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding diathesis, and active bleeding. In patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, a history of complications from anticoagulation (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), and in patients who develop a DVT or PE despite receiving anticoagulation, the use of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is appropriate. VC filters may be placed via a transvenous approach, and inhibit progression af lower extremity clots through the VC towards the lungs. IVC filters may be permanent or removable. While there is some debate surrounding their long-term effectiveness, IVC filters have been proven ta prevent PE in patients with DVT in the acute setting.\n(Choice B) The clinical benefit af thrambalytic therapy aver anticoagulation in the treatment of DVT is uncertain, but there is a definite increased risk of bleeding with thrambalytic therapy Absolute contraindications to thrombolytic therapy in DWT or PE include history of hemorrhagic stroke, active intracranial neoplasm, and active or recent internal bleeding.\n(Choice E) Compression stockings decrease venous stasis in the lower extremities and are effective in reducing postoperative venous thrombosis in low risk surgical patients. While they may be useful in preventing OW Ts, compression stockings offer no benefit in the treatment of existing DV Ts.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with OT in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated (those with recent surgery, hemarrhagic stroke, bleeding diathesis, ar active bleeding) require placement of an inferior vena cava filter ta prevent PE."

    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's signs and symptoms are highly suggestive of right-sided heart failure (jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema). This patient is a chronic smoker and alcoholic, but there are no rales on examination and the CXR does not reveal significant pulmonary congestion. His chest radiograph shows a normal sized heart with some prominent pulmonary vessels and flattened diaphragms. The mast common cause of isolated right-sided heart failure is pulmonary disease, and when it accurs is known as cor pulmonale. Car pulmonale is most commonly caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Less frequent causes include pneumocaniosis, pulmonary fibrosis, kyphoscaoliosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, and repeated episodes of pulmonary embolism. The predominant symptoms of compensated cor pulmanale are related to the pulmonary disorder and include chronic cough, exertional dyspnea, wheezing, and fatigability. When the pulmonary disease is severe enough to cause RY dysfunction, signs of right-sided heart failure develop (i.e. jugular venous distension, right sided S3, right ventricular heave, hepatomegaly, ascites, and dependent edema). A chest radiograph may reveal a prominent right ventricle and pulmonary artery, in addition to any lung disease that can be visualized.\nThis patient mast likely has cor pulmonale secondary to COPD. He has a heavy smoking history and the diminished heart sounds may be due to the hyperinflated lungs.\n(Choice A) Alcoholic cirrhosis usually results in a small and firm, fibrosed liver rather than hepatomegaly. Ascites may be present, but cirrhosis would not account for the other symptoms af right heart failure.\n(Choice B) Coronary artery disease more commonly results in left-sided ar biventricular cardiac failure. If this were the case, there would be evidence of pulmonary congestion. Rarely, coronary artery disease (especially inferior wall myocardial infarction) may cause isolated right-sided heart failure. However, chronic pulmonary disease is a much more comman cause.\n(Choice C) Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition in which a pericardial effusion develops so rapidly or becomes so large that it compresses the heart. The classical features include: jugular venous distension, hypotension, distant heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus. This patient is not hypotensive.\n(Choice D) Metastatic carcinoma of the liver can cause hepatomegaly (usually irregular hepatomegaly) and ascites; however, it would not account far the elevated JVP in this patient.\nEducational Objective:\nCor pulmonale is a term for right-sided heart failure most commonly due to pulmonary disease. Signs of right-sided heart failure include: jugular venous distension, right-sided $3, right ventricular heave, hepatomegaly, ascites, and dependent edema."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "COPD is a very cammon cause of secondary pneumothorax. Destruction of alveolar sacs and formation of large airspaces (generally in the upper lobes) are predisposing factors. Patients with pneumaotharax typically present with acute chest pain and shartness of breath. On the affected side, breath sounds are reduced and the chest is hyperresanant to percussion. In a patient with COPD presenting with catastrophic worsening of their respiratory symptoms, spantaneous secondary pneumatharax should always be suspected.\nIn cantrast, the evolution of clinical symptoms is much slower in an acute exacerbation of COPD secondary to infection ar anather inflammatory cause. Such patients generally give a history of increased production of purulent sputum, and lung examination will reveal diffuse rhonchi and wheezing. In COPD with predominant emphysema, breath sounds are reduced over bath lung fields.\nMeasurement of the arterial blood gases is a very useful tool for assessing the degree of respiratory failure. The partial pressure af oxygen (pO2) is not generally reduced until the FEV decreases below 50% af normal, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is generally nat increased until the FEV decreases by 25%. The arterial pH does nat decrease significantly unless the pCO2 is aver 45 mmHg. Hypercarbia generally accompanies ventilatory failure in patients with acute COPD exacerbations.\n(Choice B) Patients with COFD are at increased risk for pneumania. Patients with pneumonia present with chest pain, breathlessness, cough with sputum and fever. Examination reveals dullness to percussion aver the infiltrated lung, crackles and branchial breath sounds. The symptoms are slower to evalve compared to those described in the vignette above.\n(Choice C) It can be very difficult to differentiate a COFD exacerbation from acute CHF in patients presenting with acute shortness of breath. The presence of fine crackles bilaterally on physical examination is cansistent with CHF.\n(Choice E) Transudation of pleural fluid often occurs in patients with CHF. The presence of fluid in the pleural space is characterized by dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds aver the effusion (usually in the lower lung fields). It takes a very large and/or bilateral pleural effusion to cause shortness of breath.\nEducational objective:\nSuspect secondary pneumothorax in COPD patients presenting with catastrophic worsening af their respiratory symptoms."

    "question": "A 31-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath. She denies associated chest pain or palpitations. She tells you that she recently returned from a trip to Thailand. She smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. She is married and uses aral contraceptives. She has no significant past medical history. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and her heart rate is 120/min. A negative result on which of the following tests would best exclude pulmonary venous thromboembolism in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Echocardiography",
      "B. Chestxray",
      "C. Venous ultrasound",
      "D. Plasma D-dimer",
      "E. Electrocardiogram"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Pulmonary embolism (FE) is a serious and potentially fatal complication of clots within the deep venous circulation. Thus, making a prompt and accurate diagnasis is critically important. Ruling aut PE is similarly important in patients with suggestive presentations. D-dimer is a fibrin degredation product elevated in the presence of blood clots and a number of other inflammatory conditions. It is 95-97% sensitive for venous thromboembalism with a specificity of 45%. Thus, a negative D-dimer result has a negative predictive value af greater than 95%, though a positive test has poor positive predictive value. In other words, a negative result is useful in ruling out PE, but a positive test provides less definitive information.\n(Choice A) In the presence of large pulmanary embali, echocardiography may reveal pulmonary hypertension and/or evidence of right heart strain. However, small PE are unlikely to produce such changes, meaning that a normal echocardiogram is of limited value in excluding the diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Classic chest x-ray findings in patients with PE include pleural-based densities representing lung infarction (Hampton's hump) and a prominent central pulmonary artery with lacal oligemia (Westermark's sign). However, it is not uncommon for affected patients to have perfectly normal chest x-rays, making this study minimally useful in attempting to exclude a diagnosis of PE.\n(Choice C) Venous utrasonography is both sensitive and specific for diagnosing proximal deep vein thromboses. Unfortunately, only 70% of patients with PE have detectable deep vein thrombases, meaning that normal venous ultrasound of the legs cannot exclude the diagnosis of PE.\n(Choice E) 70% of patients with FE have ECG abnormalities. However, most of the changes are nonspecific. Only a very small fraction of patients with PE have the classic S-wave in lead I, G-wave in lead ll, and T-wave inversion in lead III.\nEducational objective:\nA negative D-dimer is very helpful in excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary venous thromboembalism. A positive D-dimer, however is far from diagnostic and must be followed by mare specific studies."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with a known history of recreational drug abuse is found by a friend on the floor of his apartment. There is a pool of urine around him. He is confused, not oriented to time or place, and does nat recall recent events. His blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and his heart rate is 120/min. He talks and moves all his extremities. His laboratory findings are the following:\nHemaglobin                      15.2 mg/dL\nWBC                             12,500/mm3\nPlatelets                       160,000/mm3\nSodium                          136 mEg/L\nPotassium                  5.1 mEg/lL\nCreatinine                  1.1 mg/dL\nAST                              35 units/L\nALT                              40 units/L\nAlkaline phosphatase            70 unitsiL\nCPK                             26,000 units/L\nHis urine toxicology screen is positive for cocaine and cannabinoids. The patient is at the greatest risk of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aseptic meningitis",
      "B. Acute renal failure",
      "C. Reye syndrome",
      "D. Dermatomyositis",
      "E. Splenic rupture"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The greatest risk for this patient is acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis. There is ample evidence that this patient has rhabdomyolysis. First, he has twa strong risk factors for rhabdomyolysis: immabilization and cocaine abuse. Prolonged immobilization, as suggested by his presence an the floor, causes direct muscle damage and the release of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Similarly, cocaine is a potent vasoconstrictor that causes diffuse ischemia, seizures, agitation, incidental trauma, hyperpyrexia and a direct toxic effect on myocytes. All of these may contribute to increased muscle breakdown. Second, the elevated potassium and CPK concentrations are strongly suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. As muscle cells break down, potassium, CPE, and myoglobin are released into the blood stream. In fact, 20% of cocaine overdoses are complicated by these laboratory abnormalities.\nRenal failure in rhabdomyolysis is caused by acute tubular necrosis from excessive filtered myoglobin. The risk of myoglobin-induced renal failure is significant when the CPK concentration is greater than 20,000 units/L. Aside fram an elevated creatinine, potassium, and CPK, rhabdomyalysis is suggested when a urine dipstick tests positive for blood, but no red blood cells are seen on microscopy. This finding is caused by myoglobin in the urine. The risk of rhabdomyaolysis-induced renal failure may be decreased with aggressive hydration. Mannitol and urine alkalinization may also be beneficial\n(Choice A) Aseptic meningitis is meningeal infection and/or inflammation in which no causative organisms are found on routine CSF stains and cultures. It is most commanly caused by Coxsackie virus or Echovirus. Intravenous drug abuse can predispose to bacterial meningitis.\n(Choice C) Reye syndrome is an often fatal childhood hepatoencephalopathy associated with a viral infection and treatment with salicylates. It is not assaciated with rhabdomyolysis.\n(Choice D) Dermatomyositis in an inflammatory auto-immune myopathy that causes direct destruction of skeletal myocytes. Itis, therefore, associated with elevated CPK levels, but it does nat fit the context of this atherwise healthy patient who recently used cocaine.\n(Choice E) Splenic rupture generally results from blunt abdominal trauma. Neither cocaine nar marijuana use are risk factors If trauma is not involved. Infectious mononucleosis and post transplant Epstein-Barr virus-mediated pseudolymphaoma can also predispose to splenic rupture.\nEducational objective:\nNearly 20% of cocaine overdoses are complicated by rhabdomyolysis, as indicated by marked elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK). The main danger associated with CPK levels greater than 20,000 U/L is acute renal tubular necrosis due to myoglobinuria."

    "question": "A 66-year-old man complains of exertional dyspnea that has progressed over the last two years. As a result he has had to limit his physical activities to avoid becoming short of breath. He denies any significant chest pain, but does note having a recurrent cough productive of whitish sputum. His past medical history is significant for hypertension controlled with hydrochlorathiazide. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His family history is significant for a strake in his mother. His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg and his heart rate is 80/min. Physical examination reveals a mildly overweight patient in no acute distress. His anteroposterior chest diameter is markedly increased. Breath sounds are decreased bilaterally with scattered expiratory wheezes. Which of the following agents is most likely to reduce this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alpha-adrenergic blocker",
      "B. Beta-adrenerqgic blocker",
      "C. Muscarinic antagonist",
      "D. Dopamine agonist",
      "E. Alpha 2-adrenergic agonist"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's history and presentation are classic for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COFD). Typically due to cigarette smoking, COFD causes gradually decreasing expiratary flow rates, increased lung compliance, and increased lung volumes. The only therapies proven to pralong survival in patients with COPD are smoking cessation, supplemental oxygen, and lung reduction surgery in certain patients. The remainder of therapies are aimed at decreasing respiratory symptoms, improving quality of life, and decreasing hospitalizations. The mainstays of treatment are inhaled bronchodilators, especially anti-chalinergic medications like ipratropium and tiatrapium. Anti-muscarinic agents may be cambined with shart-acting beta agonists like albuteral. Inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists may be used for patients with more severe COPD.\n(Choice A) Alpha-adrenergic blockers are used to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy and hypertension. They do not play a role in the treatment of COPD.\n(Choice B) Beta-adrenergic blockers may exacerbate pulmanary symptoms in patients with severe reactive airway disease. They are safe in mast patients with mild to maderate COPD and asthma, however.\n(Choice D) Dopamine agonists are used to treat Parkinson's disease, prolactinomas, and restless leg syndrome. They are not used to treat COPD.\n(Choice E) Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists include clonidine, methyldopa, and dexmedetomidine. Clonidine and methyldopa are used to treat hypertension. Dexmedetomidine is used for sedation in the intensive care unit. These medications are not used to treat COPD.\nEducational objective:\nInhaled anti-muscarinic agents such as ipratropium are the mainstay of symptom management in COPD. These anti-cholinergic medications may be combined with short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists for greater symptam relief."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has reactivated tuberculosis. Reactivation of latent tuberculosis typically causes an apical cavitary lesion on chest x-ray. Clinically, patients complain of chronic low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss and a cough productive of blood-tinged sputum. In the United States, most cases of tuberculosis accur in patients who have immigrated from developing countries with a high incidence of the disease.\n(Choice A) Nursing home warkers, health care workers, and prison workers come into contact with peaple who have tuberculosis mare frequently than the general public, but this patient's recent immigration from an endemic geagraphic regian is a mare significant risk factar.\n(Choice C) Smoking is a risk factor far occlusive arterial disease and various forms of cancer including squamous and small cell lung cancer as well as pancreatic cancer and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.\n(Choice D) This patient's history of breast cancer puts her at increased risk for malignancy recurrence.\n(Choice E) Hepatitis C is a risk factor for many illnesses including hepatocellular cancer, cirrhasis, lichen planus, parphyria cutanea tarda, cryoglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis.\nEducational objective:\nMost cases of active tuberculosis in the United States occur in people who have immigrated to this country from endemic geographic regions."

He denies any chest pain or diaphoresis, but has had palpitations in the past. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. On examination, he is alert and in mild distress. He has a BP of 110/70 mmHg, pulse 100/min and is afebrile. Auscultation is difficult. The chest-x ray reveals an enlarged cardiac silhouette. It appears that the left main stem bronchus is elevated. There is no other lung pathology visible. The ECG shows irregularly irregular rhythm. The pathophysiology of this condition is related to which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute pericarditis",
      "B. Rheumatic fever",
      "C. Interstitial lung disease",
      "D. Malignancy",
      "E. Sarcoidosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Mitral stenosis usually presents with symptoms in the third to fifth decade of life. The mast commaon cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever. The principal symptoms are those of dyspnea, pulmanary edema and precipitated by exercise, fever, anemia, sexual intercourse, tachycardia and pregnancy. In mitral stenosis, the left atrium gets very large and tends to push up on the left main stem bronchus. In the occasional patient, the irritation on the left main stem (and phrenic nerve) by the enlarged left atrium can produce a persistent cough.\nOther findings will include a loud S1, opening snap and a diastolic murmur. ECG will reveal atrial fibrillation and/ar left atrial enlargement when narmal sinus rhythm is present. ECHO will confirm the diagnosis. All patients should receive endacarditis prophylaxis. Mitral valve surgery is the treatment (Choice B).\n(Choice A) Acute pericarditis can present with chest pain which is sharp and pleuritic. There may be a law-grade fever and palpitations. The ECG shows diffuse ST segment elevations. Chest-x ray will reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette. ECHO will reveal the presence of effusion.\n(Choice C) In interstitial lung disease, patients may have fatigue, malaise, dyspnea and cough. Crackles may be heard and hypoxemia is common. Chest-x ray may be normal or may show a diffuse process. Generally, a lung biopsy is required for the diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Malignancy will present with weight loss, anarexia and more specific signs of a mass. Ina 44 year old, mediastinal masses can be present. CT scan of the chest is usually diagnostic.\n(Choice E) Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that may be asymptomatic or may present with cough, fever, weight loss, anorexia and fatigue Chest-x ray may show an enlarged mediastinum (bilateral hilar adnopathy) and CT scan will show adenopathy. Blood wark may reveal elevated calcium and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. Bronchoscopy and/or mediastinoscopy are required for diagnosis.\nEducational Objective:\nAn enlarged left atrium in mitral stenosis can cause a persistent cough and elevation of the left main stem bronchus."

    "question": "A 72-year-old white male with a past medical histary of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease presented to the physician's office because of fever, malaise, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath. His temperature was 38.3C(101F). His chest x-ray showed a patchy right lower lobe infiltrate. He was sent home on aral amaxicillin. Four days later, the patient was brought to the emergency room because he was having continuous fevers, headache, pleuritic chest pain, and abdominal pain. He appears confused. His blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse rate is 100 per minute, respiratory rate is 24 per minute, and temperature is 38.9 C (102 F). His chest x-ray showed consolidation of the right lower lobe. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's pneumania?",

      "F. Legionella pneumonia",
      "G. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "H. Chlamydia pneumoniae"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "In any elderly patient, confusion and tachypnea might be the anly manifestations of pneumania. Legionella pneumania should be suspected in those who have not responded to beta-lactam antibiotics. This disease accounts for 5% of community-acquired pneumania and up to 30% of nosocomial pneumania. Patients usually present with an acute onset of fever, malaise and headache followed by a nonproductive cough and dyspnea. Confusion, often with severe headache, abdominal pain and diarrhea are other characteristic features of Legionellosis. More characteristic features suggestive of Legionella pneumonia are the presence af hyponatremia (sodium of less than 130 mmal/mL) and a Gram stain smear of respiratory secretions showing many polymorphs but very few visible organisms. Chest x-ray usually shows patchy interstitial inflammation and unilateral lower lobe invalverment, which may progress to areas of consolidation over a few days.\nThe definitive diagnosis of Legionella pneumania is generally made by urinary Legionella antigen testing using an ELISA test. The treatment of choice is high dose erythromycin ar azithromycin.\nLegionella species reside in water and are transmitted to humans via aerosol Identification of the enviranmental source and reduction of Legionella colonization should be undertaken to prevent Legionellosis. The most commonly used method of decontamination is periodic superheating and flushing of water supplies. This method is particularly useful for urgent disinfection during an outbreak. Hyperchlorination is no langer recommended because Legionella species are relatively chloride-resistant. Biocides are also relatively ineffective.\n(Choice B) Mycoplasma pneumonia also does not usually respond ta penicillins or cephalosparins; however, it rarely gives severe illness. Chest x-ray usually shows peribronchial pneumania pattern. Confusian with severe headache and abdominal pain are also not typical of Mycoplasma pneumania.\nStrepiococcus, Haemophilus and Moraxella usually respond to beta-lactam antibiotics. Again, these infections usually do not cause abdominal pain and confusion with severe headache.\nEducational Objective:\nAny elderly patient who presents with pneumonia, abdominal pain, confusion and hyponatremia should be suspected for Legionella pneumonia. This should also be suspected in patients who fail to respond to beta-lactam antibiatics and Gram stain showing many polymorphs with few visible organisms. The treatment of choice for Legionella pneumonia is high dose erythromycin or azithromycin."

He also complains of bilateral ankle swelling. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking. Physical examination reveals a mildly overweight patient in mild respiratory distress. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral wheezes and a prolonged expiratory phase. His white blood cell count is 14,500/mm3 and his hemaoglobin level is 16 mg/dl. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals the following:\npH = 7.37\npO2 = 65 mmHg\npCO2 = 60 mmHg\nAbsence of marked acidosis in this patient is best explained by which of the following?",
    "options": [

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmanary disease (COPD). However, he has maintained a normal pH because his kidneys have increased bicarbonate retention to compensate for the increased pCO2. Patients with chronic hypoventilation due to COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or neuromuscular causes have gradual increases in the pCO2 that results in respiratory acidosis. To compensate, the kidneys increase bicarbonate retention approximately 0.1 mEg/L for every 1 mmHg increase in pCO2 above baseline. Importantly, patients never completely normalize or over avercarrect their pH.\n(Choice A) Minute ventilation is the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate. Patients increase minute ventilation in order to compensate for metabolic acidosis, not to carrect underlying obstructive pulmonary disease.\n(Choice B) There is increased dead space ventilation in COPD, which warsens the respiratory acidosis.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary vasoconstriction results from alveolar hypoxia. It may help normalize shunting and ventilation-perfusion mismatching within the lung but will not compensate for respiratory acidosis.\n(Choice E) The shift bicarbonate out of and chloride into erythrocytes is integral to carbon dioxide transpart throughout the body. However, this process does not markedly affect the acid/base status.\nEducational objective:\nThe body compensates for chranic hypercapnia by increasing renal bicarbonate retention. Typically 0.1 mEq/L of bicarbonate is retained for every 1 mmHg increase in pCO2."

      "E. High amylase content of the pleural fluid"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has a pleural effusion with a low glucose concentration, consistent with an exudative pleural effusion. Concentrations less than 30 mg/dL suggest an empyema ar rheumatic effusion. A glucose cancentration between 30-50 mg/dL indicates an effusion due to malignancy, lupus, esophageal rupture, or tuberculosis. Glucose concentration is thought to be deceased in exudative pleural effusions due ta the high metabolic activity of leukocytes (and/or bacteria) in the fluid.\n(Choice A) Inflammatory conditions cause pleural effusions by increasing the pleural membrane and capillary permeability. While this mechanism establishes the effusion it does not cause a decreased pleural glucose concentration, specifically.\n(Choice B) Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure is the mechanism responsible for transudative pleural effusions. It does not cause the low glucose concentration.\n(Choice C) Increased permeability of the right hemidiaphragm is thought ta contribute to the development of right-sided pleural effusions in cirrhosis, also known as a hepatic hydrothorax, Effusions due to cirrhosis are typically transudates.\n(Choice E) Elevated pleural amylase concentrations are found in pleural effusions due to esophageal rupture ar pancreatitis. High amylase concentrations are not respansible far the low glucose concentration found in these effusions.\nEducational objective:\nThe low glucose concentration in exudative effusions is due to the high metabolic activity of leukocytes within the pleural fluid."

He is emergently intubated because of poor oxygenation. His chest x-ray is shown below:\nThis film is compared to a chest x-ray performed one week earlier, which was within normal limits. Currently, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is 8 mmHg. Which of the following is the mast likely cause of his current condition?",
    "image": "",
    "options": [
      "A. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis",
      "B. Mitral stenosis",
      "C. Acute respiratory distress syndrome",
      "D. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction",
      "E. latragenic fluid overload"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient was initially admitted ta the hospital with symptoms of an acute abdomen, hypotension, and tachycardia, which together suggest severe internal bleeding. After laparotomy, he developed hypoxia, shortness af breath, and tachypnea, at which time chest x-ray showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.\nPulmonary edema can be cardiogenic ar non-cardiogenic. Non-cardiogenic pulmanary edema, or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), may develop in the setting of sepsis, severe bleeding, pneumania, toxic ingestion, or burns, when release of inflammatory mediators causes increased alveolar capillary permeability and resultant pulmonary edema. Measurement of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) can help distinguish these two processes. A PCWP <=18 mmHg suggests ARDS (Choice C), while a value >=18 mmHg suggests cardiogenic pulmonary edema.\n(Choice A) Idiopathic pulmanary fibrosis (IPF) presents with gradual onset of cough, dyspnea, crackles, and clubbing. Chest x-ray findings include decreased lung volumes and interstitial prominence, particularly at the bases. The acuity of this patient's symptoms and his diffuse alveolar (rather than interstitial) findings rule out IPF.\n(Choice B) Mitral stenosis may cause dyspnea and pulmonary edema. This patient's history of rheumatic fever puts him at risk. However, in mitral stenosis a mid-diastolic rumble is expected on cardiac auscultation and the PCWP should be elevated.\n(Choice D) Left ventricular systalic dysfunction can lead ta pulmanary edema. Given this patient's risk factors (coronary artery disease, HTM, age 64), an intra-operative myocardial infarction is plausible. However, the PCWP would certainly be elevated if this were the cause of his pulmanary edema.\n(Choice E) Iatrogenic fluid overload can induce signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure including pulmonary edema and dyspnea. However, pulmonary edema accumulates as a result of congestion and elevated hydrostatic pressure, rather than from increased alveolar capillary permeability, so the PCWP would be elevated.\nEducational objective:\nARDS is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by inflammatory damage to alveoli. Sepsis, severe bleeding, trauma, and toxic injury may result in ARDS Criteria for diagnasing ARDS include: acute dyspnea, an inciting condition, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, PCWP <18, and Pa02/F,0,, ratio <200."

    "explanation": "Sarcaid is a granulomatous disease seen typically in young black females. tis a systemic disarder, which primarily affects the lungs. The condition may be asymptomatic or the patients may present with dyspnea, fewer, night sweats, or weight loss. The classic finding on a chest x-ray is bilateral mediastinal adenapathy, as seen above. Some times patients may present just with erythema nodosum (painful skin lesions over the shins). Some individuals may have skin, eyes, liver, kidney, and central nervous system involvement. Elevated calcium and angiotensin converting enzyme levels are also seen. Once mediastinal adenopathy is seen on a chest x-ray, the next step is to perform a mediastinal bronchascapy and obtain tissue for biopsy. Symptomatic patients require steroids (Choice C).\n(Choice A) The above clinical presentation and findings are not representative of congestive heart failure In a young female, congestive heart failure would be a rare finding without any history. On chest x-ray, the lung fields will be engarged and Kerley B lines will be seen.\n(Choice B) Lupus can present with numerous systemic organ findings, but adenopathy is nat typical. Patients may have a rash, arthralgia, pneumaonitis, brain syndromes, nephritis, and a vasculitis. Diagnosis is by findings of antibodies to dsDNA.\n(Choice D) Lung cancer can present with adenopathy. Small cell cancer can present in such a way; however, the majority of patients with such significant adenapathy from lung cancer will be symptomatic.

Small cell cancer is rare in patients under the age of 40-50, especially if they are nansmakers.\n(Choice E) Most interstitial lung disease present with lung fibrosis and not adenopathy. Patients may have progressive dyspnea, weight loss, and fever. Lung parenchymal changes are seen in the majority, but a normal x-ray does not rule out interstitial lung disease. A CT scan is required, followed by a lung biopsy.\nEducational Objective:\nSarcoid can present in a black female with bilateral hilar adenopathy. Recognize the association with erythema nodosum. Biopsy typically shows non-caseating granulomas. Serum Ca and ACE levels are elevated. Steroids are the treatment of choice in symptomatic patients."

    "question": "A 42-year-old morbidly obese man is being evaluated for poor sleep. He complains of frequent awakenings due to a choking sensation and says that the resulting tiredness severely limits his physical activity. He also complains of chronic leg swelling. He denies cigarette, alcohol, or drug use. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg and his heart rate is 110/min. Which of the following additional findings is mast likely to be present in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anemia due to low erythropoietin",
      "B. Decreased chloride due to bicarbonate retention",
      "C. Decreased sodium due to increased ADH secretion",
      "D. Decreased CO2 due to persistent hypoxia",
      "E. Increased BUN due to volume constriction"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This marbidly obese man presents with classic obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypaventilatian syndrome. Patients with sleep apnea alone hypoventilate at night, which causes transient hypoxia and hypercarbia that resolves during wakefulness. Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, however, do not have respiratory mechanics that allow them ta resume normal ventilation during wakefulness and hence develop chronic respiratory failure. Consequences of abesity hypoventilation syndrome include pulmanary hypertension with cor pulmonale, secondary erythrocytosis, hypoxia, chronic hypercapnia (due to persistent hypoventilation) and respiratory acidosis. In a compensatory effort to maintain a normal pH, the kidney increases bicarbonate retention and decreases chloride reabsarption.\n(Choice A) Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome are chronically hypoxic and develop a compensatory erythrocytosis.\n(Choice C) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome may lead to cor pulmonale, volume overload, and hypervalemic hyponatremia. However, the low serum sadium in this situation is not due to increased ADH secretion.\n(Choice D) Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome have bath hypoxia and increased pCO2 due to chranic hypoventilation.\n(Choice E) This patient has total body hypervalemia and does not give a history concerning far intravascular volume depletion.\nEducational objective:\nObesity hypoventilation syndrome is a long-term consequence of severe obesity and untreated obstructive sleep apnea. It causes chronic hypercapnic/hypoxic respiratory failure, secondary erythrocytosis, pulmanary hypertension, and cor pulmonale."

    "question": "A 32-year-old Caucasian female presents to your office with persistent cough and shortness of breath. She has had three episodes of pneumonia over the last year. She had severe sinusitis one year ago, and an episode of bloody diarrhea that required hospitalization and IV antibiotic therapy six manths ago. She does not smoke or consume alcohal. She denies any illicit drug use. She is currently not taking any medications. All her immunizations are up-to-date. Her blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and heart rate is 90/min. Physical examination reveals fine crackles over the right lower lung lobe. Ma lower extremity edema is present. Meck palpation does not reveal any lymph node enlargement.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has a history of recurrent bacterial infections that is highly suggestive of immunodeficiency with involvement of humaral immunity. Selective immunoglobulin deficiency that includes [gA and/or 1gG subfractions is a possible diagnosis. Far example, selective deficiency of IgG3 alone is mare camman in adult females and is associated with recurrent sinopulmonary as well as gastrointestinal infections. Food allergies and autoimmune diseases may also be present. IgA deficiency and common variakle immunodeficiency are also possible. The latter may be associated with suppressed cell immunity and increased risk of malignancy. Quantitative measurement af serum immunoglobulin levels helps to establish the diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Cystic fibrosis is also a possibility, but it usually manifests earlier in life and does not cause gastroenteritis.\n(Choice A) Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that leads to emphysema and liver damage, but does nat increase the risk of recurrent infections.\n(Choices B and E) Methacholine challenge is used to diagnose asthma, and V/Q testing is employed in patients suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism; both these diagnoses are unlikely in this case.\nEducational objective:\nRecurrent bacterial infections in an adult patient may indicate a humoral immunity defect. Quantitative measurement of serum immunoglobulin levels helps to establish the diagnosis."

Presently, his blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and heart rate is 120 and regular. On physical exam, the patient appears drowsy. Breath sounds are diminished bilaterally but there are no wheezes. The most recent ABG reveals:\npH =7.32\npO2 = 65 mmHg\npCO2 = 50 mmHg\nWhich of the following is the best next step in managing this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Inhaled corticosteroids",
      "B. Ipratropium inhalation",
      "C. Intravenous theophylline",
      "D. Oral prednisone",
      "E. Endotracheal intubation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The mainstay of treatment for an asthma exacerbation is an inhaled short-acting Bo-agonist like albuterol. Other bronchodilators, such as ipratropium, may be beneficial early in the course. Corticosteroids are also indicated in all patients with exacerbations but they take several hours to significantly decrease inflammation. This patient has developed hypercarbia, hypoxia, and somnolence, and is nat moving air an exam despite continuous inhaled bronchodilators. He therefore needs mechanical support to breathe. Due to asthma's obstructive nature, CO2 retention is a worrisome marker of respiratory failure.\n(Choice A) In patients with asthma that is mild persistent or warse, maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids is important. However, steroids play no role in the management of acute exacerbations.\n(Choice B) Ipratropium is an anticholinergic agent that reverses vagally mediated, but not allergen-induced, branchaspasm. It has same benefit as an adjunctive medication in moderate to severe exacerbations when given early in the course.\n(Choice C) Theophylline is a bronchodilator occasionally used to treat severe asthma or COPD. It is nat considered first-line because it has a number of acute and chronic side effects and is not as powerful a bronchodilator as mast B-agonists.\n(Choice D) Intravenous corticosteroids are used in patients with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. Unfortunately, it takes several hours before clinically significant decreases in branchial inflammation can be achieved — obviously insufficient to treat this patient already in respiratory failure.\nEducational objective:\nMaderate to severe asthma exacerbations are treated with a combination of By-agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, and intravenous steroids. Patients wha develop respiratary failure, marked by hypercapnia ar severe hypoxia, require intubation and mechanical ventilation."

His past medical history is significant only far neonatal hepatitis that resolved spontaneously when he was 6 months of age. The man has never smoked. On lung auscultation today, there are decreased breath sounds over both lower lobes. Chest x-ray demonstrates emphysematous changes in the bilateral lower lobes. Routine bloodwork is normal. Which of the following analyses would be most helpful in establishing this patient's diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Open lung biopsy",
      "B. Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level",
      "C. Video-assisted lung biopsy",
      "D. High resolution CT scan of chest",
      "E. Pulmonary function testing"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's chest x-ray reveals emphysema, a diagnosis most comman in older smokers. However, patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency may develop emphysema decades earlier, even if they have never smoked. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is an enzyme that counteracts neutrophil elastase. In AAT deficiency, uninhibited elastase causes bullous changes of the lungs. The classic radiographic pattern is emphysematous changes of the lower lobes. In AAT deficiency, the involvement is panlobular, in contrast to the centrilobular pattern in smoking-induced emphysema. In addition to lung disease AAT deficiency can cause liver disease, which may manifest as neonatal hepatitis, cirrhasis ar liver failure. The diagnosis of AAT deficiency can be made by measuring the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level (Choice B).\n(Choice A & C) Lung biopsy is an invasive procedure with associated marbidity. Measurement of the serum AAT level is less invasive, and low values are highly diagnostic for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n(Choice D) When the suspicion for lung disease is high but chest x-ray is non-diagnostic, high resalution CT (HRCT) scan of the chest is warranted. This patient's chest x-ray shows the classic pattern of panlabular emphysema seen in AAT deficiency. Therefore, HRCT will not add diagnostic value.\n(Choice E) Fulmanary function testing (FFT) in emphysema reveals a | FEV1/FYC ratio, + TLC, and | DLCO. However, PFTs will not help distinguish AAT deficiency emphysema from smaoking-induced emphysema.\nEducational objective:\nSuspect alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in non-smoking adults <=45 years of age with panlobular emphysema an chest x-ray. Patients with AAT deficiency are also at risk for liver disease (neonatal hepatitis, cirrhosis, and/or liver failure). Measurement of the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level is minimally invasive but can be highly diagnastic."

    "question": "A 38-year-old male is brought to the emergency room with high-grade fever, shaking chills, productive cough and shortness of breath that started twa days ago. His medical history is significant far two hospital admissions for alcohal withdrawal seizures. He continues to drink alcohal every day. He has no other medical problems and does not take any medications. On admission, his temperature is 39.7°C (103.5°F), pulse is 110/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, and respirations are 20/min. His skin and mucous membranes are dry. Physical examination reveals crackles and bronchial breath sounds in the right lower lobe. Chest x-ray demanstrates right lower lobe consolidation. He is started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and intravenous normal saline at 200 ml/hr. Six hours later the nurse calls you because he is breathing at 38/min and requiring 100% oxygen. Emergent intubation is performed. A repeat chest x-ray is shown below.\nWhich of the following is now most likely to be present in this patient?",

      "A. Normal pulmanary capillary wedge pressure",
      "B. Increased lung compliance",
      "C. Increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure",
      "D. Normal pulmonary arterial pressure",
      "E. Maormal alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient was initially admitted ta the hospital with pneumonia. Despite the institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy, he developed a dangerous condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS most often develops in the clinical setting of sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, toxic ingestions, trauma, and/or burns. A history of alcoholism is a further risk factor for ARDS. The pathophysiology of ARDS involves release of inflammatory mediators as a result of local or distant tissue injury. These inflammatory mediators cause alveolar damage, increased alveolar capillary permeability, and leakage of proteinaceous fluid inta the alveoli. Clinically, this leads to the acute onset of tachypnea, tachycardia, fever, and dyspnea. Arterial blood gas reveals hypoxemia and chest x-ray reveals bilateral alveolar infiltrates. The differential diagnasis for hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray also includes cardiogenic pulmanary edema. An important diagnostic tool for differentiating ARDS from cardiogenic pulmanary edema is measurement of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). A PCWP <=18 mmHg suggests ARDS (Choice A), while a value >=18 mmHg suggests cardiogenic pulmonary edema.\n(Choice B) Any disease process causing edema or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma causes decreased, not increased, lung compliance. Mechanical ventilation wath positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in the treatment of ARDS to counteract the decreased compliance.\n(Choice C) Increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure may be seen in congestive heart failure caused by hypertension or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac dysfunction does not cause ARDS.\n(Choice D) Pulmonary arterial pressure is variable in patients with ARDS. Pulmonary arterial hypertension accurs in 25% secondary to hypoxic vasoconstriction and destruction of lung parenchyma.\n(Choice E) ARDS causes shunting, as evidenced by elevation of the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. In contrast, hypoventilation and decreased FiQ2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) cause hypoxemia with a normal alveaolar-arterial oxygen gradient.\nEducational objective:\nARDS is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by inflammatory damage to the alveoli. Criteria for the diagnosis of ARDS include: acute onset of respiratory distress in the setting of a predisposing condition (sepsis, pneumonia, etc), Pa02/FiO2 ratio <200, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a normal PCWE."

He was hospitalized for pneumonia four years ago but has otherwise been healthy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. He does not take any medications. His temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), blood pressure is 124/76 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min and respirations are 16/min. Pulse oximetry reveals an oxygen saturation of 88%. On chest auscultation, breath sounds are diminished throughout, and the expiratory phase is prolonged. Heart sounds are regular and there are no murmurs ar gallops.

    "explanation": "COPD is a progressive condition of limited airflow during expiration which is not entirely reversible. COFD encompasses chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Smoking is the most important risk factar for COFD. Signs and symptoms include progressive dyspnea, cough, decreased breath sounds, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Hypoxemia — measured via arterial blood gas, pulse oximetry, or hematocrit — is common. Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy has been proven to prolong survival and improve quality of life in hypoxemic patients with COPD (Choice D). Indications far oxygen therapy in COPD include: Pa02<=55, Sa02<=88%, hematocrit>=55%, ar evidence of cor pulmonale.\n(Choice A) Temparary use af systemic steroids is appropriate in the management of acute COPD exacerbations, but maintenance systemic steroids should never be used, as side effects are significant and mortality may be increased.\n(Choice B) Frophylactic antibiotics are not routinely used in COFD management. They may be appropriate in select patients during acute exacerbations but are nat proven to improve survival.\n(Choice C) While vaccinating against influenza and pneumococcus is impartant, oxygen therapy is the best proven method of improving survival in COPD.\n(Choice E) Beta-blackers are generally avoided in maoderate/severe asthma and COPD because of their bronchoconstrictive properties. Beta-aganists, however, are central to COPD management.\nEducational objective:\nLong-term supplemental oxygen therapy has been proven ta prolong survival in patients with COPD and hypoxemia. Criteria for therapy include PaO2<=55, Sa02<=88%, erythrocytosis (hematocrit>=55%), or evidence af cor pulmanale."

    "explanation": "Legionella accounts for approximately 2-10% of all community acquired pneumonias (CAF). Travel associated Legionnaire's disease is a well-documented phenomenon that has been linked to cruise ship and hotel water supplies. Symptoms that help distinguish Legionella from other causes of CAP include high-grade fever (>=39.0°C), gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurologic symptoms. Lung exam typically reveals rales and chest radiograph mast often reveals focal lobar consolidation. Legionella pneumophila is a Gram negative rod that stains poorly because it is primarily intracellular. Therefore, sputum gram stain showing many neutrophils but no organisms is alsa characteristic. The definitive diagnosis may be made by culturing the bacteria on charcoal agar and/or urinary antigen testing. Legionnaire's disease is treated with either macrolides (azithromycin) aor newer generation fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin) (Choice E).\n(Choice A) Vancomycin is used to treat patients with nosocomial pneumonia, where the probability of MRSA is high.\n(Choice B) Clindamycin is primarily used to treat infections with anaerobic organisms. It is the antibiatic of choice in aspiration pneumania.\n(Choice C) Fluconazole is an anti-fungal agent. It can be used to treat pulmanary cryptococcal infection.\n(Choice D) Amoxicillin does not cover Legionnaire's disease or ather atypical pneumonias.\nEducational objective:\nLegionella pneumaphila is an intracellular Gram negative organism commonly spread by cooling towers and water supplies. Travel-associated infection is well-documented. Symptoms suggestive af Legionnaire's disease include cough, fever >39°C, Gl symptoms, and confusion. Diagnosis is confirmed by urine antigen testing or culture on charcoal agar. Treatment with azithromycin or levofloxacin is appropriate."

She also reports the simultaneous onset of sharp, left-sided chest pain. Her previous medical history includes diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years and hypertension for the past 6 years. Her family history is significant far heart disease in her father, who died at age 40. Her medications include enteric-coated aspirin, captopril and glipizide. She has a 30 pack-year smoking history, but does not smoke currently. On physical examination, she is in acute distress and is sweating profusely. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.5°F), pulse is 140/min and irregular, respiratory rate is 30/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Her oxygen saturation is 84% on room air by pulse oximetry.

      "C. Cardiac tamponade",
      "D. Tension pneumothorax",
      "E. Pulmonary embolism",
      "F. Branchoconstrictian"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism (FE) are nonspecific and highly variable but this patient's acute onset shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain are the twa mast common symptoms of FE, accurring in 73 and 86 percent of patients respectively. Hemoptysis occurs in =20% of cases, and leg symptoms (which suppart the diagnosis by suggesting concomitant deep venous thrombosis) are present in =30%. She also has multiple physical exam findings consistent with PE including tachypnea, tachycardia, and low-grade fever, which are presentin 70, 30, and 15 percent of cases, respectively. Still, this combination of signs and symptoms—though consistent with pulmonary embalism—is by no means diagnostic. Furthermare, she does nat have the classic findings of PE on ECG (S1Q3T3) ar chest x-ray (Hampton's hump, Westermark's sign), but again such findings are present in only the minarity of cases. The ECG and chest x-ray findings described here are inconsistent with the other answer chaices provided, however. In patients with PE, low oxygen saturation and atrial fibrillation—baoth present in this patient—are associated with poor prognosis.\n(Choice A) This patient has many risk factors far myocardial infarction (diabetes, family history, and smoking), putting this high on the differential diagnosis. However, the absence of ST elevation, T wave inversion, and GQ waves on ECG make PE the more likely explanation.\n(Choice B) Atrial fibrillation is a common consequence of mitral valve stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis presents with a mid-diastolic rumble and opening snap at the apex on cardiac auscultation. Acute onset shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and tachypnea are not characteristic of this condition.\n(Choice C) Cardiac tamponade may present with dyspnea, tachypnea and tachycardia. However, the classic triad of distant heart sounds, hypotension and distended neck veins is absent in this patient, and electrical alternans is not present an ECG.\n(Choice D) Tension pneumatharax presents with acute onset shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. Exam reveals unilateral absence of breath sounds, tracheal deviation and hypatension, none of which are present here.\n(Choice F) Bronchaconstriction, as occurs in asthma and emphysema, may present with dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation. The absence of wheezing and the presence of pleuritic chest pain in this patient make bronchaoconstriction less likely. Hyperinflation is common on chest x-ray.\nEducational objective:\nThe signs and symptoms of PE are nonspecific and highly variable. It is a diagnosis that should be suspected in any patient who presents with some combination of sudden-onset shartness of breath, pleurtic chest pain, low-grade fever and hemoptysis. Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia are common exam findings. Calf swelling and Virchow's triad (stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulable state) are not always present in PE."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient likely has an anaerobic pneumonia as a complication of upper Gl endoscopy (aspiration pneumania). Patients with pneumonia caused by anaerobic arganisms typically present with systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise as well as a characteristic foul-smelling sputum. Patients with poor dentition, who have a greater quantity of anaerobic organisms in their mouth, are at greater risk of anaerobic aspiration pneumonia. The location of the infiltrate depends on the patient's body position when the aspiration accurs as the infectious agents tend to settle in dependent lung zones, such as the posterior segments af the upper lobes (recumbent) and the superior and basilar segments of the lower lobes (standing). Adding an antibiotic with anaerobic coverage, such as clindamycin, is the most reasonable next step.\n(Choice A) Doxycycline is a good antibiotic far outpatient community acquired pneumonia where the macrolide resistance is suspected.\n(Choice B) Ciprofloxacin has good gram negative coverage but is not effective for anaerobic or most gram-positive organisms.\n(Choice C) TMP+SMX is the drug of choice far pneumocystis pneumonia, and it is effective against many gram-negative and gram-positive agents, but it does not provide significant anaerabic coverage.\n(Choice E) The ampicillin and gentamicin combination has good synergism against gram-negative aerobes. It can be used for abdominal infections in combination with metronidazole.\nEducational objective:\nIn patients with fever and a cough productive of foul-smelling sputum after an upper Gl endoscopy or any ather instrumentation of the upper airway or esophagus suspect an anaerobic lung infection.

      "D. Expiratory muscle strength",
      "E. End-expiratory pressure"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Several aspects of pulmanary mechanics may be measured while patients are mechanically ventilated. The peak airway pressure (the maximum pressure during the respiratory cycle) equals the sum of the resistive pressure, elastic pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEER).\nPeak ainway pressure = resistive pressure + elastic pressure + PEEP\nThe elastic pressure, or plateau pressure, is the pressure at the end af an inspiratory hold maneuver. It is the product of the lung's elastance and the volume of gas delivered. Since one's elastic recall is inversely related to lung compliance, a decrease in compliance (e.g. with pulmanary fiborosis) is accompanied by an increase in the elastic pressure.\n(Choice A) It is impossible to calculate the upper airway resistance when a patient has an endotracheal tube in place because the tube bypasses the upper airway.\n(Choice B) In mechanically ventilated patients, the total airway resistance takes into account the resistance af the ventilator circuit, the resistance of the endotracheal tube, and the resistance of the patient's airways. The resistive pressure is alsa referred to as the peak pressure.\n(Choice D) Respiratory muscle strength is determined by measuring the patient's negative inspiratary force (MIF).\n(Choice E) The alveolar end-expiratory pressure is typically equal ta the atmospheric pressure. In abstructive lung disease, however, the alveoli cannot empty completely, resulting in higher than normal end-expiratory pressures. This is called intrinsic, or auto-, PEEP. The end-expiration hold maneuver measures auto-PEEF.\nEducational objective:\nSeveral values related to pulmonary mechanics can be calculated in mechanically ventilated patients. Lung compliance is calculated by performing the end-inspiratary hald maneuver. Airway resistance is calculated by examining the peak airway pressures. Positive end-expiratory pressure (FEEF) is calculated with the end-expiratory hold maneuver."

This should be considered in the differential diagnasis of chronic cough alang with postnasal drip, which is the number ane cause of chronic cough in nonsmokers. Usually, patients with GERD typically complain of heartburn. However, water brash is also a common presenting symptom. In this patient with persistent cough and water brash, esophagoscopy does not reveal mucosal inflammation.

It can record acid reflux at the esophageal site as well as at the pharyngeal site, which makes this test very specific for supra esophageal complications of GERD. This test is usually employed in patients with chest pain ar chranic cough when esophagoscopy is negative.\nOther tests far GERD, like mucosal biopsy (Choice A), barium swallow (Choice C), Bernstein test (Choice D), and esophageal manometry (Choice E) help to establish the diagnasis, but are less specific and usually are not helpful in demonstrating pharyngeal reflux.\nEducational Objective:\nCough can be a presenting symptom of GERD. A 24-hour pH recording is the most specific test available far acidic gastroesophageal reflux. It is usually employed to diagnose the cause of chest pain or supra esophageal complications of GERD in patients with negative esophagoscopy."

    "explanation": "This patient with HWVIAIDS presents with findings concerning far Pneumocystis jiraveci {carini) pneumania (FCP). Hypoxia in patients with pneumania occurs secondary to alveolar and interstitial inflammation, which causes areas of poor ventilation and VQ mismatch. This manifests as an increase in the alvealar-arterial axygen gradient.\n(Choice A) The pulmanary capillary wedge pressure is increased in the setting of left atrial hypertension. This is typically due to left ventricular failure but may also result fram mitral valve disease.\n(Choice B) Obstructive lung disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome can cause hypoxia secondary ta alveolar hypoventilation. Alveolar hypoventilation is rarely the cause of hypoxia in pneumonia.\n(Choice D) Lung compliance, ar distensibility, is increased in emphysema; it is not greatly affected by PCP.\n(Choice E) Pulmonary hypertension may result from pulmonary venous hypertension, typically due to left heart failure, or pulmonary arterial hypertension.

      "F. Viral antibody assay",
      "G. Echocardiogram",
      "H. Cardiac enzymes"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is presenting with pneumania. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COFD). The acute exacerbations in COPD patients may be bactenal, viral, ar non-infectious in origin. Patients with COPD are at high risk of respiratory infection due to underlying pathological abnormalities, like histological abnormalities in the airways and an impaired local host immune system. The most cammoan bacteria responsible for acute exacerbation of COPD are S pneumaniae, H. influenza, and M. catarrhalis. Clinically, it may be difficult to determine if the patient is having infectious exacerbation of COPD; however, the presence of a productive cough, fever, hypoxia, and auscultatory findings as found in this patient is suggestive of pneumonia. A chest x-ray is the mast useful preliminary and first investigation to be done in a case of suspected pneumonia in any patient (Choice C).\n(Choice A) Bronchascopy is a useful aid in some cases of respiratory infections (FCF pneumania, fungal); however, it is never recommended as a routine and preliminary investigation in suspected pneumonia.\n(Choice B) Sputum gram stain is a useful investigation for pneumonia. A specimen that contains greater than 25 PMN and less than 10 epithelial cells per low power field represents a purulent specimen: however, it is very nonspecific, and you often see the oropharyngeal flora. Many physicians do not order this test for community-acquired pneumonia, since it is often difficult to identify the microbiologic cause of the pneumania. Most often the treatment is empirical after the chest x-ray.\nObtaining routine sputum cultures (Choice E) is also controversial. One, itis difficult to interpret because of the many arganisms that cause pneumania are fastidious in the oropharyngeal cavity {including Strep pnuema and Hemophilus). The secand difficulty is these fastidious organisms overgrow the arganisms that actually cause pneumania. Another problem is that it is difficult to interpret if there is a colonizer, such as MRSA and pseudomanas.\n(Choice D) Mycoplasma causes atypical pneumania, which is characterized by fever dry cough, and bilateral perihilar infiltrates on chest x-ray. Mycoplasma serology is rarely performed, since it is not cost effective and most of the empirical antibiotics (azithromycin, levafloxacin, gatifloxacin) often caver these atypical organisms.\nEducational Objective:\nAll patients with suspected bacterial pneumania should have a chest x-ray done as the first step, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible without waiting for sputum gram stain ar cultures."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The most probable diagnosis in this patient is aspirin sensitivity syndrome. The clues to the correct diagnosis include aspirin ingestion, persistent nasal blackage, and episodes of bronchocanstriction. The pathogenesis af aspirin sensitivity syndrome is believed to involve 'pseudo-allergic reaction,’ that is an exaggerated release af vasoactive and inflammatory mediatars in susceptible individuals. Aspirin is a cyclooxygenase (COx-1 and COX-2) inhibitor. As the result of its pharmacalogic action, arachidonate diverges from blocked COXs to a 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Accumulation of leukotrienes and changed prostaglandin/leukotriene balance triggers characteristic reactions (bronchoconstriction, palyp farmation) in susceptible individuals. Leukotriene inhibitors are gaining popularity in the treatment of this condition. Other commanly used treatment modalities include topical corticosteroids and aspirin desensitization therapy.\nIgE-mediated reaction (Choice A) and immune-complex disease (Choice B) are important in the pathogenesis of some asthmatic conditions. Cytotoxic antibodies (Choice C) and cell-mediated hypersensitivity (Choice D) have limited rale in the pathogenesis of asthma.\nEducational Objective:\nAspirin sensitivity syndrome is believed to be a pseudo-allergic reaction. It results from aspirin-induced prostaglandinfleukotriene misbalance in susceptible individuals.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Initial infection by M. fuberculosis typically causes a peripheral pulmanary focus of infection accompanied by mediastinal ar hilar lymphadenopathy evident on chest x-ray. This initial infection is typically asymptomatic, and the primary site of infection, the Ghon focus, typically remains as a calcified granuloma. Reactivation of an M. tuberculosis infection can occur, especially during periods of immunosuppression. Fatients with HIV in particular have a 10% risk per year of reactivation tuberculosis. Patients with reactivation tuberculosis typically present with complaints of fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, productive cough, hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain. Such a symptom complex, especially in a high risk patient such as the one described, should prompt a chest x-ray. Reactivation tuberculosis mast commanly causes an apical cavitary pulmonary lesion as pictured in the right lung in the abave radiograph. M. tuberculosis preferentially reactivates in the apices of the lungs because it is an aerobic organism, and the oxygen tension is highest in this segment of the lungs.\n(Choices A, B & C) Bronchial asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and postnasal drip are the three mast common causes of chronic cough. Asthma would be associated with wheezing on auscultation af the lungs and possibly hyperinflation of the lungs on CXR. GERD would cause symptoms worsened 30 minutes following meals or when recumbent and would not have any findings on CXR. Pastnasal drip would show caobblestaning of the nasal mucosa in a patient complaining af nasal congestion.\n(Choice E) Coccidioidomycosis results from inhalation of the soil-borne arganism Coceidioides immitis in endemic areas such as the Southwest United States. Symptoms include a flu-like illness with dyspnea and a slightly productive cough. Varying lung lesions are possible, with a miliary pattern being the most common among HIV-positive individuals.\n(Choice F) Pneumacystis pneumonia most commanly accurs in HIV-positive patients when the CD4 count falls below 200/micral. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea and a nonproductive cough, and CXR classically shows diffuse \"ground glass\" infiltrates.\n(Choice G) Congestive heart failure may cause a chronic nonproductive caugh that is worsened when the patient lies flat. Bibasilar rales would be appreciated on auscultation of the lungs and pleural effusions would be evident on CXR.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with HIV have a 10% per year risk of experiencing reactivation tuberculosis, which manifests with fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, pleuritic pain, chronic cough and hemoptysis.

Progressive dyspnea without cough over months, plus\nchest pain and fever is typical for asbestosis. Digital clubbing and bibasilar end-inspiratory crackles are\ncommoan findings on physical examination, each seen in approximately 50% of affected patients. Typical\nchest x-ray findings include interstitial abnormalities of the lower lung fields and pleural plaques.

    "explanation": "This patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His current symptoms are\nmanifestation of an acute exacerbation of his underlying disease. The acute episodes are typically managed\nwith ipratropium and albuterol nebulization and systemic steroids. The most commonly used parenteral\nsteroid is methylprednisolone (Choice B).\nMN-acetylcysteine is a mucalytic agent, which is no langer used in exacerbation of COPD, as they are even\nimplicated in warsening branchospasm (Choice C).\nThere is some role of antibiotics, like gatifloxacin and clarithromycin, in the management of an acute episode\naf dyspnea in a patient with severe oxygen dependent COFD; hawever, this patient has already been treated\nwith antibiotics, has no fever, WBC count is normal, and there is no infiltrate on chest x-ray.

    "explanation": "[diopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a restrictive lung disease of unknown etialogy. In IPF, chronic\ninflammation of the alveolar walls causes progressive widespread fibrosis and destruction of the normal lung\narchitecture. Patients present with chronic progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough and digital\nclubbing. Fever and chest pain are typically absent. Examination demonstrates dry, end-inspiratary\ncrackles.\nPulmanary function tests (FFTs) in patients with this condition show a restrictive pattern (decreased TLC,\nFEY1 and FVC; normal FEV1/FVC). The diffusing capacity is progressively reduced, largely due to ventilation-\nperfusion mismatch, resulting in an increased A-a gradient. Chest x-rays in IPF typically demonstrate\ndecreased lung volumes, airway fibrosis giving a “haneycomb” pattern, and pulmanary vascular congestion\nmost evident in the hilum.\n(Choices B & C) In restrictive lung diseases, total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity, and\nresidual volume are all reduced. Flow volumes are also reduced but the ratio of FEV1/FYC is either normal\nar increased as alvealar fibrosis increases elastic recail.\n(Choice D) Restrictive lung diseases are more likely to cause hypoxemia than hypercarbia. The PaCOZ2 in\nIPF is usually low until end-stage disease occurs.\nEducational objective:\nThe A-a gradient is increased in interstitial lung disease due to reduced diffusing capacity and Vi\nmismatch.

A viral upper\nrespiratary infection is often the inciting event for a COPD exacerbation, if the infection and/or underlying lung\ndisease is severe, frank respiratary failure may ensue. In severe exacerbations, alveolar hypoventilation\nleads to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Sedatives should be avoided in these patients as they can exacerbate\nalveolar hypoventilation. Elevated carbon dioxide concentrations can cause confusion, somnolence, cama,\nand tanic-clanic seizures.\n(Choice A) A thromboembalic stroke is more likely to cause unilateral hemiparesis, numbness, ar\nparesthesias than somnalence or tonic-clanic seizures, particularly in the setting of a COPD exacerbation.\n(Choice B) Diffuse cerebral vasoconstriction may result from drugs (e.g. cocaine) or intracranial\nhypertension, among other causes. Here, we have no reason to suspect toxic ingestion and the patient's\nblood pressure does not support hypertensive encephalopathy.\n(Choice C) Subarachnoid hemorrhage cammaonly results from shear injury.

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with pain and swelling in the right leg. He was\nrecently hospitalized for a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and discharged on warfarin. Today\nhis INR is 1.12. Ultrasound reveals a right popliteal vein thrombosis extending into the deep femoral\nvein. What is the best initial management step far this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increase warfarin dose for goal INR = 2.0",
      "B. Start intravenous unfractionated heparin",
      "C. Initiate thrombalytic therapy",
      "D. Place inferior vena cava filter",
      "E. Discontinue warfarin and reassure"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient should be started on intravenous or low molecular weight heparin, and his warfarin dose should\nbe increased until his INR is at least 2.0. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) management is divided into acute\nanticoagulation and clot stabilization, chronic anticoagulation, and treatment of DVT-related\ncomplications. Initial clot stabilization with a heparin product is mandatory. Heparin retards further thrombus\nformation by binding to antithrombin lll and enhancing its activity; heparin stabilizes but does not lyse existing\nclot. Mext, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is necessary. Warfarin inhibits activation of the vitamin k-\ndependent clotting factors Il, Vil, IX, and x, but unfortunately it takes at least 4-5 days for warfarin to became\ntherapeutic, hence the need for concomitant \"bridging\" heparin. Lastly, patients with new DVTs should wear\ncompression stockings to decrease the risk of developing post-phlebitic syndrome, a potentially devastating\ncomplication.\nThe abave patient presents with a propagating clat in the setting of sub-therapeutic warfarin. This must be\ntreated like a new, unstable clot; thus heparin must be used while his INR becomes therapeutic.\n(Choice A) This patient certainly requires an increase in his warfarin dose to reach an INR = 2.0. However,\nthis unstable clot also requires heparin.\n(Choice C) Thrombalytics are indicated for patients with hemodynamically significant pulmaonary\nembali. They are nat routinely used for patients with DVTs.\n(Choice D) Inferior vena cava filters may be used in patients with lower extremity DVTs where\nanticoagulation is contraindicated. This patient has no contraindications to anticoagulation.\n(Choice E) First-time DVTs are typically treated with anticoagulation for 8 months. Thus, it would be\ninappropriate to discontinue warfarin in this patient.\nEducational objective:\nAcute deep vein thromboses should be treated with a combination of warfarin and heparin for the first &\ndays. After § days, the heparin may be discontinued if the patient's INR is therapeutic. Warfarin should be\ncontinued for at least 6 months in mast patients with a first-time clot. A progressing clot in a patient with a\nsub-therapeutic INR requires bridging heparin until the INR is therapeutic."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is chronic bronchitis. Along with emphysema, chranic\nbronchitis is within the spectrum of chranic obstructive pulmonary disease. The vast majority of patients with\nchronic branchitis are smokers, and the primary symptoms include exertional dyspnea and cough. Chranic\nbronchitis is defined as a chronic productive cough that has been present for at least three months in each of\nthe past twa years without an alternative diagnosis. The cough frequently is warse in the marning. This\npatient's nocturnal dyspnea fram his coughing spells is likely caused by mucus buildup in his airways as a\nresult of several hours of not coughing. The sputum in patients with chranic bronchitis is usually white ar\nyellow, and an increase in the purulence of the sputum is suggestive of a superimposed infection. Pulmonary\nfunction tests should be performed on this patient to determine the degree of airway obstruction.\n(Choice A) Patients with left ventricular failure often become dyspneic at night, but this is a result of lying flat\n(orthopnea) as opposed to a lack of sputum clearance. Patients with pulmonary edema would also have pink\nfrothy sputum as opposed to the yellow sputum described by this patient.\n(Choice B) Asthma can lead to cough and dyspnea, and can present at nearly any age. Asthma symptoms\ncan often warsen as night, but this patient's history of dyspnea occurring around the same time each night\nthat improves with mucous clearance is more suggestive of chronic bronchitis.\n{Choice D) This patient has no apparent risks for pulmanary embalism. Patients with a pulmanary embolism\nmay have hemoptysis, but a cough productive of yellow sputum would be unusual.\n(Choice E) Patients with pulmanary fibrosis have dyspnea, but usually have a dry cough as opposed to the\nproductive cough seen in this patient's case.\n(Choice F) Isolated right ventricular failure would nat be expected to result in respiratory symptoms.\nEducational objective:\nChranic branchitis is defined as a chronic productive cough that has been present for at least three manths in\neach of the past two years without an alternative diagnosis. Productive cough and exertional dyspnea are the\nmast camman complaints, and symptoms can worsen with increased mucous buildup in the\nairways. Therefore, the diagnosis should be considered in patients who report waking up around the same\ntime each night with dyspnea that resalves with sputum production."

    "question": "A 53-year-old male presents with progressively worsening dyspnea over a 4 month period. He also\ncomplains of decreased appetite, weight loss, and nagging epigastric discomfort. His past medical history is\nsignificant for a chronic duodenal ulcer for which he takes ranitidine on and off. He does not use tobacco,\nalcohol or illicit drugs. He has worked as a plumber far the past 30 years. On physical examination, his\ntemperature is 36.9°C (98 4°F), blood pressure is 140/86 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are\n15/min. Physical exam reveals fingernail clubbing and bibasilar end-inspiratory crackles on lung\nauscultation. Chest x-ray demonstrates ground glass opacities of the lower lung fields, multiple pleural\nplagues, and ane 3x3 cm mass in the right lung periphery. CT guided biopsy of the mass is planned.

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Individuals with an occupational history invalving mining, shipbuilding, insulation, ar pipe wark are at risk for\nasbestosis. Symptoms tend to develop 20-30 years after the initial exposure. The mast common clinical\npresentation is dyspnea without cough or sputum production. Bibasilar end-inspiratory crackles and clubhing\nare seen in approximately 40-50% of patients with advanced disease. Chest x-ray often reveals interstitial\nabnormalities of the lower lung fields consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Fleural plagues are also seenin\napproximately 50% of asbestosis chest x-rays, and help distinguish this condition from other causes of\npulmanary fibrosis. In addition to pulmonary fibrosis and pleural plagues, asbestosis patients are also at\nincreased risk for developing certain malignancies. Studies have shown that asbestos exposure increases\nthe risk of lung cancer 5-fold. This patient's weight loss is further indication that his 3x3 cm peripheral mass\nis likely cancerous. The mast comman malignancy in asbestosis patients is branchogenic carcinoma\n(Choice D).\n(Choice A, B & C) While asbestos exposure is known to increase the frequency of many cancers, there is\nno definitive data indicating that affected patients are at significantly increased risk for stomach, colon or\npancreatic cancers. Duodenal ulcers da not confer a strong risk far malignancy.\n(Choice E) Asbestos exposure can cause peritoneal as well as pleural mesothelioma. However, the location\naf this patient's mass is not consistent with peritoneal mesothelioma.\n(Choice F) Asbestos exposure is the anly risk factor for mesathelioma. Despite the strong link between\nthese two entities it is impartant to know that bronchogenic carcinoma has a higher incidence than\nmesothelioma in patients with asbestos exposure. Furthermore, this 3x3 cm mass is in the lung field, notin\nthe pleura as would be the case in mesathelioma.\nEducational objective:\nAsbestos exposure increases the risk of malignancy, pulmanary fibrosis and pleural plagues. In terms of\nmalignancies, both bronchogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma are linked to asbestos exposure, with\nbronchogenic carcinoma being the more comman cancer in these patients."

Taking into account the growing\npopularity of ACE inhibitars in the treatment of various conditions, this side effect is getting more important in\nthe differential diagnosis of the chronic cough syndrome. The pathogenesis of the cough is related to an\naccumulation of the inflammatory or proinflammatary mediators bradykinin, substance F, thromboxanes, and\nprostaglandins. If the cough is disturbing, ACE inhibitor therapy should be discontinued. Only if the cough\npersists after the discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy, then chest radiography (Choice A) is\nrecommended.

    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering a COPD exacerbation, which is characterized by an acute\nworsening of symptoms in a patient with chronic lung disease. COPD exacerbation is a very common cause\naf hospitalization in the US. Upper airway infections (bacterial or viral) are the most common precipitants of\nCOPD exacerbations; such an infection explains the patient's week-long history of fever and cough. Patients\naften present with cough and shortness of breath; a significant smoking history is common. Finding bilateral\nwheezes on examination, respiratory distress, accessory respiratory muscle use and a prolonged expiratory\ntime favors a diagnosis of obstructive lung disease. Finally, the patient's ABG shows hypoxia, hypercapnia\nand respiratory acidosis, an ABG profile consistent with COPD.\n(Choice A) Congestive heart failure is characterized by exertional dyspnea, orthopnea and chronic\nnonproductive cough.

      "A. Congestive heart failure",
      "B. Hypoalbuminemia",
      "C. Pulmanary embalism",
      "D. Aspiration pneumonia",
      "E. Malignancy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has a pulmonary embolism (PE) from a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in one of her\nimmobilized legs. The fact that she is wheelchair-bound puts her at increased risk for DVT. Over half of\npatients with a OVT in a proximal leg vein will experience a PE, which manifests clinically with dyspnea,\ntachypnea and pleuritic chest pain. Arterial blood gas analysis in this setting typically shows respiratory\nalkalosis and a widened A-a oxygen gradient due to WIC mismatch. Chest x-ray may be normal or show\nevidence of atelectasis and/or pleural effusion. When pleural effusions develop, the pleural fluid may be\nexudative ar transudative (exudative is most common) and its composition can vary widely. While pulmanary\nangiography is the gald standard for diagnosing PE, in practice, helical CT scanning is the diagnostic test of\nchaice.\n(Choice A) Pleural effusions in congestive heart failure are typically bilateral and symmetric. These effusions\nare transudative, with few RBCs or WBCs and a glucose concentration equal to that of the serum. Increased\nintravascular hydrostatic pressure is the underlying mechanism responsible.\n(Choice B) Effusions in hypoalbuminemia are similar to those in CHF. The mechanism here is decreased\nintravascular oncatic pressure.\n{Choice D) Aspiration pneumonia will initially cause an exudate due to chemical pneumonitis. Without\ntreatment, the effusion may progress into a pulmonary abscess, leading ta empyema with frank pus in the\ninfiltrate.\n(Choice E) Malignancy in the lungs ar pleural space can cause turbid ar bloody exudates, with lymphaocyte-\npredominance of the WBC fraction and many RBCs. The glucose concentration can be variable depending\nan the tumar burden, but it approximates the serum value in early effusions.\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary embolism should be suspected in all patients at risk for DVT who present with acute-onset\ntachypnea, dyspnea and chest pain. The diagnostic test of choice is helical CT scanning of the chest."

    "options": [
      "A Decrease the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)",
      "B. Decrease the tidal volume",
      "C. Decrease the FiO2",
      "D. Decrease the respiratory rate",
      "E. Increase the respiratory rate"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Acute pancreatitis causes adult respiratory distress syndrame (ARDS) in approximately 15% of patients. In\npatients with ARDS mechanical ventilation improves oxygenation by providing an increased fraction of\ninspired oxygen (FiO2) and by providing PEEF to prevent alveolar collapse. In the hospital setting, the arterial\np02 provides an important measure of oxygenation. Itis influenced mainly by the FiQO2 and PEEF level. The\narterial pCO2, a measure af ventilation, is affected mainly by the respiratory rate and tidal volume.\nThe narmal FiQO2 at sea level is 0.21, or 21%. Patients are often provided a high FiO2 (= 80%, ar 0.8) initially\nin mechanical ventilation, pending the results of the first blood gas analysis. The ventilator settings can\nsubsequently be adjusted based upon these results. (The goal is to maintain paQ2 = 60) An important early\ngoal in initial ventilator management should be to decrease the FiO2 to non-toxic values. There is no strict\ncut-off FiOZ2 value for oxygen toxicity, but levels below 50-60% are desirable. In this case, the patient's initial\nABG values indicate appropriate ventilation and excessive oxygenation. Thus the FiQ2 should be slowly\ndecreased to below 60% to prevent axygen toxicity to the lungs.\n(Choice A) Decreasing PEEP would lower oxygenation by decreasing the number of alveoli available for gas\nexchange. While this would address the patient's increased paiJ2, it would be better to decrease the FiQ2 to\nalso decrease the likelihood of oxygen toxicity.\n(Choices B, D & E) Tidal volume (TV) and respiratory rate (RR) are the major determinants of pulmonary\nminute ventilation, which predominantly affects the paCO2. This patient's initial ventilator blood gas shows a\nnormal paCO2, so the minute ventilation can be considered appropriate far his current condition. The TV and\nRR ventilator settings do not need to be changed at this time.\nEducational objective:\nAcute pancreatitis can cause adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in up to 15% of patients. The first\nstep in the initial ventilator management of ARDS is usually to decrease the FiQ2 to relatively non-toxic values\n(i.e. = 80%). PEEF may be increased as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation after the FiO2 is lowered."

      "C. Metastatic osteosarcoma",
      "D. Blastomycaosis",
      "E. Coccidioidomycosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A 3-month history of low-grade fever, night sweats, productive cough, and weight loss could be explained by\nchranic infection, malignancy, ar rheumatologic disease. In this particular patient, the skin involvement, lytic\nhone lesions, and geographic location make Blastomycosis (Choice D) the mast likely cause of his\nillness. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that occurs most often in the vicinity of the Great Lakes,\nMississippi river and Ohio River basins. (Wisconsin has the highest infection rate.) The pulmonary\nsymptoms and chest x-ray findings of Blastomycosis may resemble tuberculosis and\nhistoplasmosis. However, systemic Blastomycaosis may cause characteristic ulcerated skin lesions and lytic\nbone lesions.\n(Choice A) Reactivation tuberculosis (Tb) could explain this patient's systemic symptoms and upper lobe\ninfiltrate. Disseminated Tb may affect many organs and tissues including the peritoneum, cervical lymph\nnodes, eyes, hanes, and skin. Risk factors for Tb include homelessness, alcoholism, immunasuppressian,\nand wark in the healthcare field. This patient's lack of risk factars makes this diagnosis less likely.\n(Choice B) Sarcoidosis is a rheumatolagic disease which may present with fever, cough, weight loss, and\narthritis. Chest x-ray typically reveals bilateral hilar adenopathy with interstitial infiltrates. Erythema nodosum,\ntender red nodules on the shins, are the typical skin manifestation. Bone lesions are not expected.\n{Choice C) Osteasarcoma is a rare cancer that mainly affects adolescents. The distal femur is the region\nmost often affected, and patients will present with a soft tissue mass and localized pain. Systemic\nsymptoms like fever and weight loss are generally absent. Skin lesions are not expected.\n(Choice E) Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection of the lungs that can cause fever, cough, and night\nsweats. Extrapulmaonary manifestations may involve the skin, meninges, and skeleton. Coccidioidomycosis\nis endemic to the southwestern United States, not Wisconsin.\nEducational objective:\nBlastomycosis is a pulmanary fungal infection endemic to the Great Lakes, and Mississippi and Ohio River\nbasins. Systemic Blastomycosis may cause skin and bane lesions in addition to pulmanary\nmanifestations. Broad-based budding yeast grown from the sputum confirm the diagnosis. Itraconazole or\namphotericin B may be used to treat symptomatic disease."

      "D. Place a second chest tube",
      "E. Pulmonary consult for bronchoscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Empyema is an infection in the pleural space. Empyema can occur from parapneumanic effusions. They can\nalso occur as a result of contamination of the pleural space by rupture of a lung abscess, a bronchopleural\nfistula, penetrating trauma, a thoracotomy, and infection from a hepatic or subphrenic abscess, or from a\nruptured viscus (esophagus). One comman cause of empyema is after a hemothorax. The residual blood in\nthe chest is an excellent medium far the growth of bacteria. The individual will usually present with a low-\ngrade fever, and empyema is best diagnosed with a CT scan. When the empyema is localized, complex, and\nhas a thick rim, anly surgery is the answer. In surgery, the thick pleural peel is removed, the pus is remaved,\nand the chest is drained. All old blood clots are drained and removed. (Choice A)\n{Choice B) Empyema, which is recent in onset, can be removed by fibrinalytic therapy. Both streptokinase\nand urokinase have been used. However, in a patient with a recent matar vehicle trauma, fibrinolytic therapy\nis contraindicated. In addition, the fibrinalytics usually do not have much success when the empyema is\nloculated and has a thick rim round it.\n(Choice C) Antibiotics are useful for early empyema. Any subacute empyema, or those which are complex,\nwill nat resolve with just antibiotic therapy. Drainage is always required. Increasing the dose of antibiotics\nusually does nat treat complex effusions or empyema.\n(Choice D) When an empyema fails ta be drained by a single chest tube, another chest tube may be placed\nJust in case the first one is blacked. However, for complex empyema, chest tube insertion can be difficult and\nis best dane under ultrasound ar CT scan guidance. When a thick peel is present, a second chest tube\nusually does nat wark. The removal of the thick fibrinous peel in surgery is called decortication.\n(Choice E) Bronchoscopy may be required if one suspects a blockage in the airways and to help clear\nsecretions. However, when an empyema has occurred after trauma, bronchoscopy is a redundant\nprocedure. It does not aid in the diagnasis, nar does it help in clearing up the effusion.\nEducational Objective:\nBlood in the chest, if it is not evacuated, can get infected. The majarity of patients will present with a law-\ngrade fever, dyspnea, and chest pain. Surgery is required to remove the clotted blood and fibrinous peel."

    "explanation": "This woman has a pulmonary embolism (FE) on top of a gastrointestinal illness. Suggestive signs and\nsymptoms include her acute, unilateral, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and tachycardia. The wedge-\nshaped pulmonary infarction with accompanying unilateral, right-sided pulmonary effusion an CT is likely to\nhave occurred distal to a completely occluded pulmonary artery. PEs are a comman cause of both\ntransudative and exudative pleural effusions. On chest x-ray, such wedge-shaped areas are known as\nHampton's hump. A different chest CT viewing mode would likely reveal a pulmonary artery filling defect\nconsistent with pulmonary embolism.\n{Choice A) While patients with HIV are at increased risk far pulmonary tuberculosis, this woman has a recent\nnegative PFD (false negative unlikely in a patient with a CO4 count of 350/ul} and does not have the classic\ncavitary lesions on CT. Pulmonary TB does nat typically cause wedge-shaped lesions.\n(Choice C) Pneumocystis pneumonia is a comman cause of dyspnea in patients with HVAIDS. Haowewer, it\ntypically occurs in patients with CD4 counts less than 200/ul, and tends to be subacute in presentation.\n(Choice D) Bacterial pneumonia presents with rapidly progressing chest pain, fevers, chills, cough, and\ndyspnea. Alveolar infiltrates may be seen an chest x-ray and CT, but are not typically wedge-shaped.\n(Choice E) While lung cancer can cause cough, chest pain, and dyspnea, imaging is mare likely to show a\nrounded mass than a peripheral, wedge-shaped lesian.\nEducational objective:\nPulmonary emboli classically present with sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and\nhemoptysis. Chest CT showing wedge-shaped infarction is virtually pathognomanic."

Detailed\nhistory, examination and lab testing fail to reveal any obvious cause ar risk factor for his deep venous\nthrombosis. |diopathic deep vein thrombosis is diagnosed and the patient starts a 6-month course of warfarin\nanticoagulation. What is the goal INR therapeutic range in this patient?",

      "E. Greater than 4"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Proximal deep vein thromboses of the lower extremity are the most comman saurce of pulmonary embolism\n(FE). Patients with D%Ts should be treated acutely with heparin. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin is the\nmast comman long-term therapy; warfarin should be continued at least 3 manths in patients with a reversible\nrisk factor and for 6-12 manths in patients with idiopathic DWT. Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K-dependent\ncoagulation factors (ll, VII, [X, and X) of the extrinsic clotting pathway, reflected in the prothrombin time\n(FT). The INR is the ratio of the patient's FT to a standard international reference FT. The goal INR varies\nwith the condition being treated. For an idiopathic venous thromboembolism [VTE], the goal INR is 2.5 with\nan acceptable range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Choice C).\n(Choice A) An INR of 1.0 indicates that the patient's PT is equal ta the normal contral, with no inhibition of\nclotting. An INR between 1.0 and 1.5 is subtherapeutic for treatment of a patient with idiopathic VTE.\n(Choice D) An INK of 2.510 3.5 is desired in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Far this patient, the range\nof 2.5 t0 3.5 would be supratherapedutic.\n{Choice E) The risk of bleeding in patients treated with warfarin correlates with the degree of anticoagulation\nand increases substantially when the INR is greater than 4.\nEducational objective:\nWarfarin dosing should be adjusted to maintain a goal INR appropriate for the condition being treated. For\npatients with idiopathic VTE or atrial fibrillation, a target INR of 2.0 to 3 0 provides adequate anticoagulation\nwithout an excessive risk of bleeding."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's renal and pulmonary findings together suggest a diagnosis of Goodpasture's disease, a\ncondition mast comman in young adult males. Renal findings in Goodpasture's disease include nephritic-\nrange proteinuria (<1.5 g/day), acute renal failure, and urinary sediment with dysmarphic red cells and red cell\ncasts. Pulmanary findings include shortness of breath, cough, and hemoptysis caused by pulmonary\nhemarrhage. Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, arthralgias) are uncommaon. The underlying cause is\nformation of antibodies to the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, a protein expressed most strangly in the\nglomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Renal biopsy demonstrating linear [9G deposition along the\nglomerular basement membrane on immunofiucrescence (Choice A) is diagnostic.\n(Choice B) Pneumocystis pneumonia (FCF) typically affects HIV patients with CD4 counts <200. Fever,\ndyspnea, and non-productive cough are the mast characteristic symptoms. Fatigue, weight loss, and chills\nare also comman. FCF does not involve the kidneys.\n{Choice C) This patient's cough, hemoptysis and dyspnea could represent tuberculosis (Th), but Th tends to\nalso cause systemic symptoms like weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Th infection may invalve the\nkidneys (causing dysuria. hematuria): secondary amyloidosis causing nephrotic range proteinuria is also\npossible.\n{Choice D) Pulmonary thromboembolism presents with sudden-anset dyspnea. Cough, hemoptysis,\npleuritic chest pain, and fever may also occur. The kidneys would not be involved.\n(Choice E) Endocarditis could potentially explain this patient's presentation, with nephritic syndrome\nsecondary to immunocomplex depasition and hemoptysis secondary to septic emboli. However, almost all\npatients have prominent systemic symptams (fever, chills, dyspnea, sweats, and weakness), plus possible\nnew onset heart murmur, Osler's nodes, Roth's spots, Janeway lesions, and splinter hemarrhages.\nEducational objective:\nGoodpasture's disease affects the lungs (causing cough, dyspnea, and hemaptysis) and kidneys (causing\nnephritic range proteinuria, acute renal failure, and dysmorphic red cells/red cell casts an\nurinalysis). Systemic symptoms are uncamman. Diagnosis is made by renal biopsy showing linear IgG\nantibodies along the glomerular basement membrane."

      "C. Acid aspiration",
      "D. Nasal secretions",
      "E. Bradykinin production"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Based on her history, this patient's dry cough is most likely secondary to postnasal drip associated with\nallergic rhinitis. Postnasal drip of nasal secretions can cause irritation and initiation of the cough reflex. In\ngeneral, allergic rhinitis is a diagnosis that can be made based on history and physical examination. There is\ngenerally a background of environmental allergies.\nH1 histamine blockers are widely used to treat patients with allergic rhinitis. Mast are available aver-the-\ncounter without a prescription. Chlorpheniramine is a specific H1 antihistaminic receptor blocker that\nreduces the action of histamine on H1 receptors, decreasing the allergic response. In addition to blocking H1\nhistamine receptors, chlorpheniramine has ant-inflammatary effects by blocking histamine release from\nmast cells.\n(Choice B) Up to 1/3 of patients with allergic rhinitis have coexisting branchial asthma, which is\ncharacterized by bath bronchial hyperreactivity and branchial inflammation. These patients generally give a\nhistory of wheezing, which will be evident on physical examination. H1 histamine blockers have little effect on\nasthma symptoms.\n(Choice C) Acid reflux can cause upper respiratory tract irritation sufficient to cause cough. Suppressian of\nstomach acid secretion by HZ histamine receptor blockers like ranitidine ar proton pump inhibitars like\nameprazale will alleviate symptoms in these patients.\n(Choice E) About 5-20% of patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors develop dry\ncough. This is because ACE inhibition causes decreased degradation of bradykinin and substance\nFP. Accumulation of these substances causes cough.\nEducational objective:\nH1 histamine receptor antagonists decrease nasal inflammation and post-nasal drip in patients with allergic\nrhinitis."

    "question": "A 50-year-old male presents to his physician complaining of daytime somnolence. He reports that yesterday,\nhe fell asleep while stopped at a red light. His wife adds that he is a habitual snarer, and sometimes seems\nto stop breathing for seconds at a time while sleeping. His past medical histary is significant for\nhypertension, a 25 pack-year smoking history, and a two beer per day drinking habit. Physical examination\nreveals an obese, middle-aged man in no apparent distress. His pulse is 88/min, blood pressure is 160/100\nmm Hg, and respirations are 14/min.

      "C. MRI of the upper airways",
      "D. Nocturnal polysomnography",
      "E. Dexamethasone suppression test"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Based on his history, this patient likely has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Individuals with OSA exhibit\nperturbed respiratory patterns during sleep. Fatients or their spouses will commonly note snoring and\ndaytime sleepiness. Other complaints may include marning headaches, poor concentration, and restless\nsleep. OSA is most comman in middle-aged males. Other risk factors include obesity and abnormalities of\nthe upper airway (tonsillar hypertrophy, excessive soft tissue, micrognathia). Consequences of untreated\nOSA can include depressian, hypertension, impotence, cor pulmaonale, and accidents related to daytime\nsomnalence. When OSA is suspected, nocturnal polysomnography (Choice D) is the gold standard far\ndiagnosis.\n(Choice A) CNS stimulants such as methylphenidate are used ta treat narcolepsy. Methylphenidate would\nimprave the patient's daytime sleepiness, but would not address the underlying OSA.\n(Choice B) Pulmonary function testing is not used in the diagnosis of OSA, as affected patients tend to\nbreathe normally while awake.\n(Choice C) MRI of the upper airways may be appropriate in preparation for uvulopalatopharyngoplasty\n(surgery for OSA). However, MEI cannot diagnose OSA, as nat all patients with OSA have hypertrophy of the\nupper airway structures nor da all patients with hypertrophy of the upper airway structures have\nOSA. Surgery for OSA should only be considered when CPAP aral appliances, and weight loss have praven\nineffective.\n(Choice E) The dexamethasone suppression test can diagnose Cushing's syndrame. Affected patients\nclassically exhibit central obesity, hypertension, a \"buffalo hump,\" muscle wasting and thin skin. There is na\nindication that this patient's obesity is due ta Cushing's.\nEducational objective:\nObstructive sleep apnea is an under-diagnosed condition common in the obese population. Snoring, daytime\nsleepiness, and apneic episodes during sleep should raise suspicion far OSA. Affected patients are at risk\nfar hypertension, heart disease, car pulmanale, and accidents. Polysomnography is used for diagnosis."

He has never\nsmoked cigarettes. Which of the following is the mast appropriate next step in the management of his lung\nlesion?",
    "options": [
      "A CT-guided biopsy",
      "B. CT scan of the chest",
      "C. Bronchoscopy",
      "D. Obtain previous x-rays to compare",
      "E. Obtain whole body CT scan"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An incidentally discovered solitary pulmonary nodule on radiographic imaging may be benign (infectious\ngranuloma, hamartoma) or malignant (bronchogenic carcinoma, metastasis) in etiology. VWhile biopsy is the\nanly way to definitively determine whether a nodule is benign or malignant, clinicians may apply clinical and\nradiographic information to assess the likelihood of malignancy. Clinical characteristics favaring malignancy\ninclude age = 50, history of smoking, weight loss, and previous malignancy. Radiographic characteristics\nshould also be considered. Large size, low density, spiculated borders, and absence of calcifications all\nfavar carcinoma. Rate of lesion growth is an extremely important parameter. Malignant nodules tend to\ndouble in size between once a manth and once a year. When possible, examination of previous chest x-rays\n(Choice D) is the best next step in the work-up of a patient with an incidental pulmonary nodule. If a previous\nchest x-ray demonstrates that the lesion has been stable in size for = 2 years, malignancy is effectively ruled\naut and na further testing is necessary.\n(Choice A & C) CT-guided biopsy and bronchoscopy are both methods of obtaining a tissue sample far\ndefinitive diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is best far biopsy of centrally-located lesions, while CT-guided\npercutaneous biopsy is best for peripheral lesions. Biopsy is warranted when clinical and radiographic data\nindicate an intermediate probability of malignancy.\n(Choice B) CT scan of the chest has greater sensitivity than chest x-ray for detecting pulmanary nodules,\nand also provides greater detail regarding a lesion's size, borders and density. Serial CT scans are\nperformed at 3,6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months ta follow nodules determined ta have a low probability of\nmalignancy, and for which previous radiographic studies are unavailable.\n(Choice E) Full body CT scan could provide staging information (nodal invalvement, presence af\nmetastases) in cases of malignancy. However, since this patient's cancer risk is very low, and total body\nimaging involves significant radiation exposure, there is no indication for full body CT here.\nEducational objective:\nIncidental discovery af a pulmanary nodule on radiographic imaging is comman. The first step in the work-up\naf such nodules is to obtain any previous radiographic lung images. Absence of growth aver time rules aut\nmalignancy. If previous films are not available, then the nodule is assigned either a low, intermediate ar high\nprobability of malignancy based on clinical and radiographic data. Law probability nodules are followed by\nserial high resolution chest CT, intermediate probability nodules are further investigated with PET scan and/or\nbiopsy, and high probability nodules are removed surgically."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can sometimes have similar presentations which can\nconfuse physicians. Although this patient has a history of asthma, her pattern of symptoms suggests that\nGERD is responsible far her current problem. Importantly, her caugh and wheezing occur at night but not\nduring the day, a feature mare consistent with GERD than asthma. Mightime GERD is especially likely in\npeople who eat dinner late in the evening and go straight to bed because the recumbent pasition favars\nreflux. Subsequent aspiration of gastric contents during sleep is very irritating to the upper and lower airways,\nand can cause sare throat, cough, and wheezing. Nighttime GERD can alsa cause the patient ta wake in the\nmiddle of the night with symptoms similar to an asthma attack.\nInitial treatment of GERD involves lifestyle modifications such as avoiding late evening meals and elevating\nthe head of the bed. Patients may alsa be prescribed a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (FP) for symptom\nrelief, making pantoprazole the drug of first choice for this patient.\n(Choice A) Lisinopril may induce cough, but is unlikely to produce strictly nocturnal symptoms.\n{Choice B) Aspirin is recommended far all diabetic patients far primary prevention of coronary and\ncerebrovascular events. While aspirin may cause Gl upset in some, these symptoms would not be strictly\nnocturnal. Furthermore, most diabetic patients take a dose af aspirin so low (81 mg) that GI symptoms rarely\nresult. Atrial of a PPI should be attempted before discontinuing this patient's aspirin.\n(Choice F) Benzacaine lozenges can help to relieve sore throat symptoms, but do not eliminate the primary\ncause of the problem.\nEducational Objective:\nA patient with asthma-like symptoms that occur only at night and nat during the day may actually be suffering\nfram GERD. Such patients should adopt anti-GERD lifestyle modifications and receive a trial of a PPL."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering fram an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). The\npatient's history of coronary artery disease puts him at risk for heart failure due to left ventricular\ndysfunction. Uncontrolled hypertension and his smaking history are risk factars far coronary vascular\ndisease in this patient. On pulmonary examination, patients with worsening CHF will commanly have\nbibasilar crackles. Decreased breath sounds at the bases could be due to pleural effusions fram\nCHF Wheezing can occasionally be present in heart failure (cardiac asthma). It is also a possibility that this\npatient may have concomitant COPD. The blood gas findings show hypoxia, hypocapnia, and respiratory\nalkalosis; these are highly suggestive of CHF compared to COPD. Mare specific testing for CHF would\ninclude assessment of the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNF) and the pulmanary capillary wedge pressure.\n(Choice B) In COPD exacerbation, examination typically shows widespread bilateral wheezes, and ABG\nfindings include respiratory acidosis and hypoxia.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary embolism presents with acute-onset dyspnea, tachypnea, and pleural chest\npain.

Physical examination reveals hyperresonance to percussion, diminished tactile and vocal\nfremitus, and decreased or absent breath sounds in the affected area.\n(Choice E) Adult respiratory distress syndrome can have a very similar presentation but the history and risk\nfactors suggest CHF as the mast likely diagnosis.\nEducational objective:\nCHF exacerbation can cause tachypnea as left ventricular dysfunction allows fluid to poal in the lungs,\ncausing a pleural effusion and hypoxemia due to reduced ventilation. Tachypnea causes hypocapnia and\nrespiratary alkalosis. Exam typically shows signs of fluid overload, 53 and 34 gallops, cardiomegaly, and\nbibasilar crackles in the lungs."

In OHS, derangement of the ABG is usually a consequence of decreased lung\ncompliance (Choice I}, which occurs secondary to increased pulmanary blood volume and resultant\nengorgement of the pulmanary capillaries. Decreased lung compliance leads to increased work of\nbreathing. Eventually, the wark of breathing becomes so high that the CNS chemoreceptors establish a\nhigher pCO2 set-point, causing resultant hypoventilation, hypercapnia and hypoxemia. Respiratory muscle\nweakness (Choice J) also occurs in many OHS patients, but it is nat the major cause of the clinical findings.\nEducational Objective:\nOHS (Obesity Hypaventilation Syndrome) is defined by severe obesity (greater than 150% of ideal bady\nweight) and alveolar hypoventilation during wakefulness.

    "explanation": "The clinical presentation and the chest x-ray of this patient is suggestive of pleural effusion with or without a\nlung mass. A pleural effusion is present when there is an excess quantity of fluid in the pleural space. When\npleural effusion is suspected or diagnosed, the first step is to determine the cause of pleural effusion, and\nmanagement starts with determining whether the fluid is transudate or exudate. Diagnostic thoracentesis is\nthe preliminary investigation of chaice in the management of pleural effusion, except in patients with classic\nsigns and symptoms of congestive heart failure, where a trial of a diuretic is warranted.\nDiagnostic tharacentesis is a bedside, minimally-invasive procedure that permits fluid to be rapidly sampled,\nvisualized, examined microscapically, and quantified. Pleural fluid analysis provides decision-making\ninformation in 90% of cases. If a diagnostic tharacentesis shows exudative pleural fluid, further diagnostic\ninvestigations are indicated.\nMalignant pleural effusion is very likely in this patient, who is a chronic smoker, presenting with weight loss\nand plural effusion. & CT scan will most likely show a lung or mediastinal mass in this patient. Diagnostic\nthoracentesis would determine the type of pleural fluid {transudative fluid would rule out malignant effusion)\nand may also show malignant cells. Lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and lymphoma are the three tumars\nthat cause approximately 75% of all malignant pleural effusions.\n(Choices A, B, D, and E) are all useful in evaluating the cause aof exudative pleural effusion; however, the\nfirst step in the management of pleural effusion is diagnostic thoracentesis to determine whether the etiology\nis transudative or exudative. Bronchoscopy is a close alternative in this case; however, this requires sedation\nand is considered to be a relatively invasive procedure. This will be the next step if the pleural fluid cytology is\nnon-diagnostic and the patient has lung mass. If the pleural fluid cytology 1s positive for lung cancer, then the\npatient does nat require a bronchoscopy.\n(Choices F and G) Diuretics and echacardiography are indicated in patients with heart failure. In that case,\npatients present with fluid averlaad (weight gain), pedal edema, and, an exam, crackles are heard an bath\nlung bases.\nEducational Objective:\nUndiagnosed pleural effusion is best evaluated with thoracentesis, except in patients with clear-cut evidence\naf congestive heart failure.\n*Extremely high yield question for USMLE!!"

    "options": [
      "A. Excessive anesthesia",
      "B. Pulmonary edema",
      "C. Pulmonary embolism",
      "D. Aspiration pneumonia",
      "E. Exacerbation of bronchial asthma"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has hypoxemia (F,O,< 80). Disorders that cause hypoxemia can be broken down into four\ncategaries: hypoventilation, decrease in inspired axygen, shunting, and VQ mismatch. By analyzing the\narterial blood gas (ABG), calculating the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a gradient), and determining\nwhether administration of 100% oxygen leads to improvement, one can determine the specific type of\nhypoxemia plaguing a particular patient.\nThe characteristics of each category of hypoxemia are as follows: 1) Hypoventilation presents with an\nelevated PCO, with a normal A-a gradient, 2) Low inspired axygen presents with a normal PCO, plus\nnormal A-a gradient, 3) Shunting presents with a normal PCO, and elevated A-a gradient that does not\ncorrect with administration of 100% oxygen, and 4) V/Q mismatch presents with a normal FCO, and\nelevated A-a gradient that does correct with 100% oxygen.\nHypoventilation is a potential surgical complication in cases where excessive anesthesia (Choice A) has\nbeen used, but is not the explanation far the hypoxemia in the patient above as the PCO; is not\nelevated. The next step is to calculate the A-a gradient (F,05-P 05). P02 is the measured value of arterial\noxygen obtained by ABG (60 in this case), and PO, refers to the alveolar oxygen value. P,0s is calculated\nusing the following equation:\nP p05 = FiO,(760-47) - P,CO,/0.8\nPaO, = (0.21*713) - (37/0.8) = 150-46 = 104\nThen, to calculate the A-a gradient:\nA-a gradient = Py O5 - P05 = 104-60 = 44\nA normal A-a gradient is <15 in a young person. Values increase with age, but an A-a gradient =30 is\nconsidered elevated regardless of age. The fact that this patient has an elevated A-a gradient leaves only\nshunting and W/Q mismatch as potential explanations for his condition. His failure to improve with 100%\naxygen rules out Y/Q mismatch, as might accur in the case of pulmonary embolism (Choice C) or\nexacerbation of bronchial asthma (Choice E), leaving shunting to explain his hypoxemia. Comman causes\naf shunting include pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and vascular shunt. This patient is afebrile, making\naspiration pneumonia (Choice D) unlikely. His many risk factors for myocardial infarction and decreased left\nventricular function (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and recent blood loss/surgery) make\npulmonary edema (Choice B) the most likely explanation for his ABG abnormalities and rales on pulmonary\nexam.\nEducational objective:\nUnderstand the A-a gradient and know its applications. Understand and be able to differentiate the main\ncauses of hypoxemia in the hospitalized patient."

Disease anset is usually around age 40, with men and\nwomen equally affected. The upper respiratary tract is the mast common site of invalvernent and symptom\npresentation. Granulomatous inflammation in the nasopharynx causes epistaxis, purulent rhinorrhea, ofitis,\nsinusitis and, over time, saddle nose deformity due to destruction of the nasal cartilage. Cutaneous\nmanifestations are varied and include painful subcutaneous nodules, palpable purpura, and/or pyoderma\ngangrenosum-like lesions as in the patient described above. Laboratory testing typically demonstrates a\npositive C-ANCA due to antibodies against proteinase-3 and an elevated CRP. Urinalysis shows RBC casts,\nproteinuria and sterile pyuria if glomerulonephritis is present. Treatment is with cytotoxic agents such as\ncyclophosphamide.\n(Choice A) Pulmonary tuberculosis can cause hemoptysis and cutaneous findings, including scrofuloderma\naverlying infected lymph nodes, a facial eruption known as lupus vulgaris and others. Masal destruction is\nmare typical of leprosy than cutaneous tuberculosis.\n(Choice B) Bronchogenic carcinoma may cause hemoptysis but is nat commonly associated with ulcerative\ndiseases of the skin.\n(Choice D) Severe mitral stenosis can cause hemoptysis, but associated dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea and\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea would also be expected.\n{Choice E) Fulmonary embolism may cause hemoptysis, but associated acute-onset dyspnea and chest\npain would also be expected.\n(Choice F) Clinical manifestations of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may range from asymptomatic\nto causative of severe respiratory distress and massive hemoptysis in instances of rupture.

    "explanation": "Mon-productive cough is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors. It occurs in 5-20% of patients receiving\nthese agents. Pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this adverse effect includes the accumulation of\nkinins and a possible activation of the arachidonic acid pathway (choice B). Kinins are degraded by\nangiatensin-converting enzymes: therefare, they accumulate as a result of ACE inhibitor therapy. Anather\nphysiologic effect of ACE inhibitors is an increase in serum renin level, but this is not responsible for\nproducing cough (choice C).

      "G. Chest physiotherapy",
      "H. Tracheostomy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The assist control mode of mechanical ventilation delivers a predetermined tidal volume with every\nbreath. Inspiratory cycles can be initiated by the patient, but if the patient fails to breathe at a set minimum\nrate, then the ventilator will deliver the tidal volume on its awn. In general, tidal volumes should be about 6\nml/kg of ideal body weight: thus, the tidal volume being administered to the patient above is\nappropriate. However, the arterial blood gas reveals an increased pH (> 7.4) and decreased pCO2,\nconsistent with respiratory alkalosis secondary to hyperventilation. Thus, decreasing the respiratory rate\nwould be the most appropriate next step in his management.\n(Choice A) Bronchaodilatar therapy is useful in patients with obstructive lung disease to help conduct inspired\nair from the trachea to the alveali. This patient is not hypoxic and does not appear to be having difficulty with\nventilation.\n{Choice B) The Fi0O2 setting of 40% is appropriately low to avoid oxygen toxicity in this patient.\n(Choice D) Increasing the tidal volume would increase ventilation and worsen the patient's respiratory\nalkalosis.\n(Choice E) Incentive spirametry is utilized ta prevent atelectasis in bed-bound patients, particularly following\nsurgical procedures. It has no role in the treatment of intubated, mechanically ventilated patients.\n{Choice F) This patient's blood pressure is within normal range. Some patients with severe acute\npancreatitis do need suppart with positive inotropic agents, but they are not indicated in this particular patient\nat this time.\n(Choice G) Chest physiotherapy is utilized in patients with pneumonia or atelectasis to loosen and promate\nexpectoration of secretions. Patients with bronchiectasis require long-term chest physiotherapy.\n(Choice H) A tracheostomy may be indicated if prolonged intubation is foreseen or if the patient has difficulty\nmaintaining airway patency and/ar managing airway secretions following weaning from mechanical\nventilation, but this is nat a pressing issue in this patient at this time.\nEducational objective:\n“Ventilation is defined as the product of the respiratory rate and the tidal volume. Respiratory alkalosis results\nfrom hyperventilation. In mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory alkalosis in the setting of an\nappropriate tidal volume, the respiratory rate should be lowered. (Reductions in tidal volume can trigger an\nincreased ventilatory rate, potentially exacerbating the situation.)"

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This elderly former smoker presents with acute dyspnea accompanied by fever, bilateral wheezes, prolonged\nexpirations and accessory muscle use. His ABG is consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis (in chronic\nrespiratory acidosis, HCO5 is expected ta increase by 3.5 mEg/L for every 10 mmHg increase in\npCO,). This presentation is most consistent with an acute COPD exacerbation due concomitant infectious\nbronchitis. Treatment for an acute COPD flare involves branchadilators (including a beta-adrenergic aganist\nsuch as albuterol), antimuscarinics (ipratropium), and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. A two week oral\ncorticosteroid taper is alsa recommended because itis proven to shorten hospital stays and prolong intervals\nbetween exacerbations. Corticosteroids are likely beneficial because they reduce inflammation and reactive\nedema in the bronchial mucosa. Supplemental oxygen may also be of benefit, though care must be taken\nwhen administering oxygen ta chronically hypoxic patients because it can suppress their hypoxia-fueled\nrespiratory drive.\n(Choice B) In contrast to the dyspnea of CHF, dyspnea in COFD is not due to pulmonary edema and is thus\nnot helped by diuretics.\n(Choice C) Airway obstruction in COPD is mainly due to infectious/inflammatary mucosal edema, bronchial\nsmooth muscle hypertrophy and bronchial submucosal gland hyperplasia. Thus, mucalytics would not be\nexpected to have significant therapeutic benefit.\n(Choice D) Aminophylline and methylxanthines are branchadilatars used in the treatment of asthma, a\ncondition marked by airway obstruction due ta reversible branchoconstriction.\n{Choice E) While diltiazem can have bronchodilatory actions, itis not commanly used in the treatment of\nasthma ar COPD.\n{Choices F & G) Cromalyn sodium and leukotriene inhibitors are useful in the prevention of acute asthma\nexacerbations, though neither is typically first-line.\nEducational objective:\nRecommended therapy for an acute bacterial exacerbation of COPD includes supplemental oxygen, inhaled\nbronchodilators (B2 agonists and anticholinergics), broad-spectrum antibiotics, a two-week carticosteroid\ntaper and smoking cessation."

      "E. Continue current medical regimen"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The management of asthma varies depending on symptom severity. Asthma is classified into four\ncategories: intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent. The categary is\ndetermined by assessing the frequency of a patient's daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, and use of\nshort-term beta agonists, plus pulmonary function testing. In intermittent asthma, daytime symptoms occur =\n2 days/week, nighttime awakenings = 2Zx/month, use of beta agonists = Zxweek, baseline FEV and\nFEY1IFVC are normal, and there are no limitations an daily activities. The above vignette describes a patient\nwith intermittent asthma. The appropriate pharmacologic management far intermittent asthma is a short-\nacting bronchodilator (e.g. albuteral) for as needed (FRM) use, with no need for daily controller\nmedication. Since the patient is already using an albuterol inhaler, he should simply continue his current\nmedical regimen (Choice E).\nIn addition to a PRN albuteral inhaler, patients with mild persistent asthma (symptoms =2 days/week but less\nthan daily, nighttime awakenings 3-4x/manth, minor limitation of activities, and normal PFTs) should be\nprescribed a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (Choice B) as a cantraller medication.\nIn addition to a PRN albuteral inhaler and low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, patients with moderate persistent\nasthma (daily symptoms, weekly nighttime awakenings, and FEV1 60-80% of predicted) should be\nprescribed a long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist inhaler (Choice A).\nPatients with severe persistent asthma (symptoms throughout the day, frequent nighttime awakenings,\nextremely limited activity, and FEV1 =60% predicted) should receive a PRM albuteral inhaler, long-acting beta-\n2 agonist inhaler, and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Oral prednisone (Choice D) can also be used in\ncases of severe persistent asthma.\n(Choice C) Theophylline is a methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor that causes\nbronchaodilation. Though its use is limited samewhat by its side effect profile, it is occasionally used as the\ncontroller medication in persistent asthma\nEducational objective:\nMild intermittent asthma, the least severe form, is defined as symptoms £ Zxfweek, = 2 nighttime\nawakenings/month, with a normal FEY1 and na limitations on activity. For this form of asthma, only a PRN\nalbuterol inhaler is required. Daily contraller corticosteroids are reserved for persistent asthma."

    "explanation": "While this patient received appropriate treatment for her asthma attack, her muscle weakness is a\nmedication side effect. Beta-2 agonists like albuterol reduce serum potassium levels by driving potassium\ninto cells. In some patients, clinically significant hypokalemia can result, causing muscle weakness,\narrhythmias, and EKG changes. Other common side effects of beta-2 agonists include tremor, headache\nand palpitations. Obtaining a serum electrolyte panel would be helpful here to canfirm and assess the\nseverity of this patient's hypokalemia.\n(Choice A) The peak expiratory flow rate is an important objective measure for evaluating the severity of an\nasthma attack and monitoring far respiratory improvement. However this patient's respiratory symptoms\nhave subsided.\n(Choice B) Chest x-ray in an acute asthma exacerbation may reveal lung hyperinflation, but generally will nat\naffect management. Chest x-rays are most useful where foreign body aspiration ar underlying pneumonia\nare suspected.\n(Choice C) Weakness may be a presenting symptom of hyper- or hypathyroidism. Such patients are also\nlikely to present with cold intolerance and weight gain (hypothyroidism) or heat intolerance and weight loss\n(hyperthyroidism). This patient's acute presentation and histary, however, should raise greater concern for\nhypokalemia.\n(Choice E) EMG measures the electrical activity of muscle fibers and is useful in the evaluation of muscle\nweakness due to neuropathic or myopathic conditions. This patient's muscle weakness is most likely due to\nhypokalemia, and therefore an electrolyte panel is a mare appropriate first step in her evaluation.\nEducational objective:\nInhaled albuterol and systemic steroids are appropriate treatments for acute asthma attacks. Patients on\nhigh doses of beta-2 agonists may develop hypokalemia, which may present with muscle weakness,\narrhythmias and EKG abnormalities. Other common side effects of beta-2 agonists include tremar,\npalpitations and headache."

      "D. Check sputum far acid fast bacillus (AFB)",
      "E. Echocardiography"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Prominent bronchioles on chest x-ray suggest bronchiectasis. Other suggestive chest x-ray findings include\nperipheral opacities and linear atelectasis. In bronchiectasis, abnarmally dilated segments af the bronchial\ntree cause impaired clearance of secretions and resulting airflow obstruction. Presenting symptoms include\ncough (>30% of patients), mucaopurulent sputum (=75%), and hemoptysis (25%). Bronchiectasis may be\neither inherited or acquired. Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited cause. Acquired bronchiectasis\nmay be secondary to tuberculosis (Th) or recurrent bacterial pneumonia. Haiti has the highest rate of Th in\nLatin America, making this the most likely underlying diagnosis. Smoking also increases the likelihood of\nbronchiectasis. High resolution CT {(HRCT) scanning of the chest (Choice A) is the imaging modality of\nchoice for diagnasing bronchiectasis.\n(Choice B) Bronchoscopy and alveolar lavage (BAL) is often used to establish diagnoses like pneumacystis\npneumonia and certain lung cancers. Rigid bronchoscopy may occasionally be used in bronchiectasis, but\nnon-invasive HRCT is preferable.\n(Choice C) Bronchography is an invasive procedure that uses contrast to image the interior passages of the\nrespiratory tract. Risks include infection and bronchospasm. Before the advent of HRCT, bronchography\nwas often used to diagnose bronchiectasis, but now the procedure is rarely performed.\n(Choice D) Detection of AFB in a patient's sputum can confirm suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. While\nthis patient's productive cough and hemoptysis are certainly suspicious, his chest x-ray is most consistent\nwith bronchiectasis, as Is the absence of fevers, chills, and night sweats. He likely has a history of Th\ninfection, but bronchiectasis is a better explanation for his current condition.\n(Choice E) Echocardiography would be appropriate if this patient's cough were believed ta be of cardiac\narigin (CHF, endocarditis, etc.). However, his history and prominent bronchiales on chest x-ray make\nbronchiectasis a more likely explanation.\nEducational objective:\nIn bronchiectasis, branchial dilation causes impaired clearance of secretions and resultant airway\nabstruction. Acquired bronchiectasis is often secondary to prior Th or recurrent pneumania, while inherited\nbronchiectasis is most often due to cystic fibrosis. Symptoms include cough, mucopurulent sputum, and\nhemoptysis. Chest x-ray may reveal prominent bronchioles, peripheral opacities and linear\natelectasis. HRCT is used for definitive diagnosis."

    "question": "A 32-year-old male presents to your office complaining of daytime sleepiness and frequent nighttime\nawakenings. He says that his sleep gets disrupted by a choking sensation, sometimes accompanied by\ncough and dyspnea. After such episodes he typically has trouble falling back to sleep. The patient notes that\nhis symptoms are somewhat improved when he sleeps with multiple pillows. Physical examination is\nunremarkable except far a BMI of 29 Kg/m®. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "F. Gastroesophageal reflux disease",
      "G. Primary snoring",
      "H. Panic attacks"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The differential diagnosis of repeated nocturnal awakenings associated with dyspnea and cough includes\nasthma, cangestive heart failure and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Daytime sleepiness may\nresult from any condition causing sleep interruption. Overnight asthma attacks (Choice B) would not be\nimproved by head elevation, nar would repeated avernight asthma exacerbations (a sign of advanced\ndisease) occur in a patient without daytime symptoms, wheezes on exam, ar a history of asthma. Heart\nfailure (Choice C) can cause paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, cardiac asthma and simple orthopnea, which\nmay all disturb sleep and improve with head elevation, but a patient with this degree of heart failure would\nlikely have consistent signs an physical examination (e.q. peripheral edema, bibasilar rales, decreased\nexercise tolerance). The description in the vignette favars a diagnosis of GERD. Reflux of gastric contents\ninto the pharynx gives the classic unpleasant sour taste of \"heartburn,\" and reflux into the larynx and\ntracheobronchial tree can cause cough, bronchial constriction, laryngitis, hoarseness, laryngaspasm and\npossibly aspiration pneumania. Chranic GERD may be complicated by laryngotracheal stenosis, pulmonary\nfibrosis and Barrett's esophagus.\n{Choice A) Restless leg syndrome is characterized by abnormal creeping or crawling sensations in the\nlower extremities that are exacerbated by inactivity and relieved by motion. Difficulty falling asleep and\nnocturnal awakenings may occur.\n(Choice D) Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by loud snoring with occasional apneic episodes,\ntypically in an obese patient. These episodes are usually witnessed by the patient's spouse and are not\ntypically remembered by the patient. A choking sensation and cough are nat classically present.\n{Choice E) Central sleep apnea causes nocturnal awakenings with apnea due to a failure of central\nrespiratory drive. A choking sensation and cough are not typically present. This condition is often secondary\nto stroke.\n(Choice G) Primary snaring results from nocturnally increased pharyngeal airflow resistance causing noisy\ninspiration. It generally does not cause sleep disturbances.\nEducational objective:\nRepeated nocturnal awakenings associated with dyspnea, cough and a choking sensation, especially in an\naverweight or obese patient, are mast likely due to gastroesophageal reflux disease."

    "question": "An 82-year-old woman presents 1-hour after the sudden onset of moderate-to-severe epigastric pain. The\npain radiates to her back, both scapulae, and both arms. She has been nauseated and vomited three\ntimes in the past hour. Her past medical history is remarkable for peptic ulcer disease 10-years ago,\ncholelithiasis for the past 6-years, and stable angina pectoris for the past 3-years. She has had occasional\nepisodes of biliary colic and twa bouts of acute cholecystitis which were treated conservatively. Her\ntemperature is 36 8C (98 2F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are\n14/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation.

      "C. Electrocardiogram",
      "D. Upright abdominal x-ray",
      "E. Serum amylase and lipase"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient might have cholecystitis, pancreatitis, complicated peptic ulcer disease (PUD), or myocardial\ninfarction (MI). Aortic dissection can also be a possibility. Pain that radiates to the arms is strongly\nsuggestive of MI, especially in a patient with known coronary artery disease. MI can present with abdominal\n(epigastric) pain, especially inferior and posterior infarctions. If you have a high index of suspicion for MI, you\nshould obtain EKG/serum cardiac enzymes immediately - you must rule out MI before further Gl work-up.\nThe other diagnoses listed in the differential are often not immediately life threatening except for aortic\ndissection. Pain from acute cholecystitis may radiate to the right scapula. Pain from acute pancreatitis\nusually radiates to the back, but rarely as high as the level of the scapulae. Perforated PUD usually produces\nsigns of peritoneal irritation.\nEducational objective:\nMI is one of the differential diagnoses of acute abdominal pain and should be ruled out in patients with risk\nfactors."

      "D. Gastroesophageal reflux",
      "E. Mallory-Weiss syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "image": "",
    "explanation": "After the contents of the oral cavity are collected on the tongue and propelled into the pharynx, involuntary\ncontraction of the pharyngeal muscles pushes the material into the esophagus. The cricopharyngeus\nmuscle contracts behind the food bolus initiating a peristaltic wave to propel the bolus downward; this\ncontraction is shown aon the first diagram as an upward deflection on both the normal and patient graphs.\nThe second diagram shows normal peristalsis of the middle esophagus. Under normal conditions when the\nfood bolus reaches the lower esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes to allow the material to\nenter the stomach. The third diagram portrays the decrease in LES pressure that corresponds ta its\nrelaxation in the narmal patient.\nEsophageal manometry of the patient A reveals normal contraction of upper esophageal sphincter,\ndecreased peristalsis of the midesophagus illustrated by a lower amplitude of pressure increase on the\nsecond diagram, and no LES relaxation. These manometric findings are consistent with a diagnosis of\nachalasia (Choice C). This motor dysfunction is associated with an elevated resting pressure of the LES\nand inability of the LES to relax during swallowing.\n(Choice A) Cricopharyngeal dysfunction results from a failure of the cricopharyngeus to relax during\nswallowing and causes a choking or \"food sticking” sensation and pain with swallowing. A video fluoroscopic\nswallowing study is used far diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) is an esophageal motility disarder that presents with severe,\nnon-cardiac chest pain. It occurs due to uncoordinated contractions of the esophageal body. Esophageal\nmanometry shows multiple contractions on tracings from middle and lower esophagus.\n(Choice D) Reflux of gastric contents into the distal esophagus occurs due to low tone of lower esophageal\nsphincter and its failure to contract after the transfer of food to stomach. Esophageal manometry in patients\nwith GERD would show decreased LES pressure.\n(Choice E) Tears of esophageal mucosa at the esaphagogastric junction are called Mallory-VWeiss tears.\nThese tears are caused by forceful retching and vomiting, and are comman in alcoholics. Mallory-Weiss tear\nis not a motility disorder and is not associated with abnormalities of esophageal manometry.\nEducational Objective:\nDecreased esophageal body peristalsis and poor relaxation of the LES on manometry are typical for\nachalasia. Achalasia presents with progressive dysphagia, chest pain, food regurgitation and aspiration.\nBarium swallow shows a dilated esophagus and a \"bird's beak\" deformity of the LES."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The above case is a classic description of factiious diarrhea, specifically laxative abuse. The diarrhea\nassociated with laxative abuse is typically described as watery with an increase in bath frequency\nand volume of stool. The bowel movement is generally profuse, with approximately 10 to 20 bowel\nmavements occurring daily. Nocturnal bowel movement and painful abdominal cramps may be\naccompanying symptoms. As in this case, the patient is usually employed in the medical field, comes from a\nhigher socioeconomic class, and generally has a history of multiple hospital admissions in an effort to\nestablish the cause of the diarrhea. The diagnosis can be confirmed with the characteristic biopsy finding of\ndark brown discalaration of the colon with lymph follicles shining through as pale patches (melanasis cali);\nthis is typically seen in those using ar abusing anthraguinone-caontaining laxatives (e.g. bisacodyl). It\ngenerally develops within four manths of the onset of laxative ingestion, and can disappear in the same\namaunt of time if laxative use is discontinued. In addition, an alternative means of diagnosis is histological\nevidence of pigment in the macrophages of the lamina propria.\n(Choice B) Nocturnal bowel movement is not characteristic of functional diarrhea, such as irritable bowel\nsyndrome.\n(Choices C, D and E) Melanosis coli is not characteristic far celiac disease, infectious diarrhea, or\nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nEducational Objective:\nLaxative abuse is characterized by very frequent, watery, nocturnal diarrhea.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is mast likely suffering from iron deficiency anemia (low MCV and hemaglobin) secondary to\nchronic gastrointestinal (Gl) blood loss. A single negative fecal occult blood test is not sufficient to diagnose\naccult blood loss. Additional studies should be perfarmed, such as iron studies to determine if the anemia is\ndue to an iran deficiency. The characteristic findings of iron deficiency anemia are low iron, low serum ferritin\nand high TIBC levels.\nIn elderly patients, iron deficiency anemia is attributed to Gl blood loss until proven otherwise, and such\npatients are therefore subjected to colonoscopy. Gl blood loss without Gl complaints is most likely caused by\ncancer of the colon: therefare, colonoscopy is performed first. If the colonoscapy is negative, upper Gl\nendoscopy is then performed. Another indication far perfarming an upper Gl endoscopy is a current ar\nsignificant histary of NSAIDs and/or histary of peptic ulcer disease. If both colonoscopy and upper Gl\nendoscopy are negative, capsule endoscopy is performed to look for small intestinal disease\n(e.g., arterio-venous malformations).\n(Choice A) This patient's cardiac changes are mast likely due to the anemia, and nat due to an underlying\nheart disease. Her heart murmur is a flow murmur. Furthermare, her wide pulse pressure indicates the\nhyperdynamic circulation in anemia. Therefore, there is no need for echocardiography at this time.\n{Choice B) Bone marrow biopsy is not indicated in this patient. It can be considered if the other cell lines\n(platelets and WBC) are also abnormal.\n(Choice E) Radioisotope scans are typically used for patients with active bleeding. If this patient was actively\nbleeding, the stool heme occult test will be positive, however, her symptoms have been present for a few\nmonths.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most common cause of iron deficiency anemia in an elderly patient is gastrointestinal blood lass.

    "explanation": "The patient is most likely suffering from toxic megacolon secondary to ulcerative colitis. Toxic megacolon is\na serious complication of inflammatory bowel disease and is most commonly seen in ulcerative\ncolitis. Patients with toxic megacolon present with high fever, tachycardia, dehydration, significant abdominal\ndistention with tenderness, leukocytosis, and anemia. The characteristic finding on x-ray is colonic\ndilatation. In this patient, the air-filled loops of the colon demonstrate haustral markings, which are typical for\nlarge bowel. The diameter of the colon is more than 6 cm. These findings, along with the patient's\npresentation are diagnostic for toxic megacolon.\n(Choice A) Crohn's disease is a chronic transmural inflammatary disease of the Gl tract. The mast common\nclinical manifestations are abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea and weight loss. Crohn's disease can be\ncomplicated by intestinal obstruction, localized perforation or fistula formation. In Crohn's disease, the small\nbowel is frequently involved and there are skip lesions. Linear ulcers with a cobblestone pattern are\nfrequently seen. The condition is initially managed medically, and surgery is reserved far complications.\n(Choice B) Pseudomembranous calitis is usually associated with antibiotic usage. The other common\npredisposing conditions include malignancy, COPD, immunosuppressive therapy and renal failure. The\npseudomembranes are mare praminent in the sigmoid/rectal area. Diarrhea and abdominal pain are\ncomman symptoms. C. difficile is a gram-positive, spore-forming organism which is responsible for the\ndisorder. Some antibiotics are more likely to induce changes in the normal Gl flora, such as clindamycin, for\nwhich the risk of colitis is quadrupled. Also implicated are the cephalosparins and ampicillin. Typically, colitis\nis produced after a patient has been receiving an antibiotic for same time, but it can occur even after a single\ndose.\n(Choice D) 5 aureus gastroenteritis is due to the ingestion of preformed enterotoxin. It has a shart\nincubation period and short duration. Individuals present with vomiting and profuse watery diarrhea. Fluid\nreplacement is adequate treatment. There is na bloody diarrhea seen with this condition.\n(Choice E) The presentation of colon cancer depends an the location of the tumar in the colon. Generally,\nright-sided tumars tend to grow larger than left-sided tumors. Tumars on the right side tend to present with\nanemia, whereas left-sided tumors present with bowel obstruction. A change in bowel habits is comman to\nall colon cancers. Left-sided tumors can present with symptoms of abdominal pain and bowel obstruction.\nThe definite diagnosis of colon cancer is made by colonoscopy and biopsy. Toxic colon is a rare presenting\nfeature of colon cancer.\n(Choice F) Rarely, Campylobacter, Shigella and Salmonella infections can be complicated by toxic\nmegacalon.\n(Choice G) In HIV patients, CMV calitis can cause toxic megacalon.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most common cause of toxic megacolon is ulcerative colitis. Toxic megacolon is a medical emergency;\ntherefare, the prompt administration of IV steroids, nasogastric decompression and fluid management are\nrequired."

    "explanation": "Minimal bright red blood per rectum (BRBFR) is also called 'scant hematochezia' ar minimal rectal bleeding.\nAlthough there is no standardized definition, this candition is assaciated with patient complaints of small\namounts of bright red blood an toilet paper after wiping, a few drops of blood in the toilet bowl after defecation,\nand small amaunts of blood an the surface of the stool. Red blood intermixed with stool is not included in this\ncategory.\nMinimal BREFR is seen in approximately 14 - 16 percent of people. Some of the most common causes are\nhemarrhaids, anal fissure, polyps, proctitis, rectal ulcers and cancer. Hemorrhoids can be present in\nanywhere from 27 to 95 percent of cases of minimal BREFR. The management of BREFR depends on the\npatient's presentation and risk factors. If the patient is less than S0-years-old, has na other risk factars for\ncolon cancer, and presents with minimal BRBFR, office-based anoscopy or practoscopy should be\nperformed first. If no etiology is found, colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is then cansidered. Office-based\nanoscopy/proctoscaopy are simple maneuvers, have high yield and do nat require bowel preparation.\nAnoscopy has higher sensitivity for diagnosing hemorrhoids than flexible endoscopy.\n{Choices A and D) Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy would be the appropriate next steps in this patient if he\nwas more than 50 years old or had other risk factors far colon cancer.\n{Choice B) The patient admits to seeing bright red blood; therefore, occult blood testing will be of no further\nhelp at this time. Occult blood testing is of value in cases of melena or undiagnosed anemia.\n(Choice E) Barium enema is not an appropriate first investigation for this condition.\nEducational Objective:\nOffice-based anoscopy/proctoscopy should be the initial procedure in patients less than 50 years old who\npresent with minimal bright red blood per rectum and do not have any risk factors for colon cancer.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "It is highly likely that the above patient is suffering fram esophageal cancer involving the lower esophageal\nsphincter (LES). Malignancy involving the LES can lead to progressive dysphadgia (i.e, difficulty swallowing\nsolids, followed by that of liquids). Factars in this case which make malignancy the mast likely diagnosis is\nthe patient's age, acute onset of symptoms, weight lass, and significant smoking and drinking history.\nMalignancy is more commaon in the elderly age group; therefore, any elderly patient with such symptoms\nneeds to be tharoughly investigated. Malignant lesions usually have a short history of presentation; the\nduration of symptoms is usually less than 6 months. Another objective criteria is the amount of weight loss.\nPatients with esophageal cancer have mare profound weight loss over a short duration of time. Attempts to\nperform endoscopy of the esophagus often leads to difficulty in passing through the gastroesophageal\njunction. CT scan can diagnose such cases more definitively. The CT finding of any marked or asymmetric\nthickening of the wall can suggest malignancy, which can necessitate the need for biopsy.\n(Choice A) Achalasia alsa presents as dysphagia far solids and liquids: however, sometimes esophageal\ncancer can present with a similar picture, as mentioned above. Radiographic studies of both diagnoses may\nbe similar; therefore, it is best ta have a high level of suspicion, especially if there are other symptoms or\nclinical features which cannat be explained by achalasia.\n(Choice C) Patients with scleroderma have other additional features, such as cutaneous thickening and\nRaynaud's phenomenan. There may be symptoms of heartburn due to acid reflux. Lower esophageal\nsphincter tone will be decreased.\n{Choice E) Fatients with diffuse esophageal spasm have chest pain and dysphagia. A \"corkscrew\" pattern\nis seen on barium swallow. Manometry is usually diagnostic.\n(Choice D) Patients with peptic stricture usually have a history of acid peptic disease. Patients usually do\nnot have systemic symptoms.\nEducational Objective:\nEsophageal cancer may mimic achalasia clinically, radiologically AND manometrically (pseudoachalasia)l\nFeatures that favor malignancy over achalasia are: older age, a short history, rapid weight loss, and inahility\naf the esophagoscope to pass through the lower esophageal sphincter."

    "explanation": "Bowel perforation is one of the complications of acute diverticulitis. The characteristic features are acute\nabdominal pain and chest x-ray findings of free air under the diaphragm. Immediate surgical treatment is\nnecessary. In acute situations where there is no time for prepping and cleaning the bowel, surgical resection\naf the perfarated bowel and proximal colostomy should be performed.\n(Choice A) Obtaining anather CT scan is nat needed since this will not change the management of the\npatient. In this case, the initial CT revealed an inflamed colon, and the chest x-ray showed free air\nunderneath the diaphragm, suggesting a perforation. Twa situations that frequently present with free air\nunderneath the diaphragm are perforated peptic ulcer and perforated inflamed colan. The treatment\naf perforated bowel requires surgery.\n(Choices B and C) Colonoscopy and barium enema are contraindicated when bowel perforation is\nsuspected. Colonoscopy can result in worsening of the injury, especially during acute diverticulitis. Barium is\ninjected under pressure, and can result in abdominal spillage if there is bowel perforation.\n(Choice D) Observation with antibiotic therapy is hazardous if free air has been identified. The inevitable\nresult is massive sepsis with death if surgery is not performed. For these reasons, antibiotics\nare continuously given until after surgery. Such antibiotics should cover gram-positive, gram-negative and\nanaerobic bacteria.\nEducational Objective:\nFree air underneath the diaphragm signifies bowel perforation and requires urgent laparotomy."

    "question": "A 51-year-old obese male presents to your office complaining of difficulty swallowing solids but nat\nliquids. His medical history is significant for GERD. Six months ago he was diagnosed with Barrett's\nesophagus. He reports that three months after the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, his heartburn\nresolved. Barium swallow now reveals an area of symmetric, circumferential narrowing affecting the distal\nesophagus. Which of the following best explains this finding?",
    "options": [
      "A. Esophageal adenocarcinoma",
      "B. Hiatal hernia",
      "C. Achalasia",
      "D. Peptic stricture",
      "E. Vascular ring"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Chronic GERD predisposes to Barrett's esophagus (intestinal metaplasia of the lower esaphagus) but also to\nbenign peptic esophageal strictures. Benign strictures affect 5-15% of GERD patients. Both benign peptic\nesophageal strictures and Barrett's esophagus are consequences of the body's reparative response to\nchronic expasure to gastric acid, and can occur simultaneously. Peptic strictures typically cause slowly\nprogressive dysphagia to solid foods without anorexia or weight loss. As strictures progress, they can\nactually block reflux, leading to improvement of heartburn symptoms. Peptic strictures tend to appear as\nsymmetric, circumferential narrowings on endoscopy. Based on this patient's clinical history and endoscopic\nfindings, peptic stricture (Choice D) is the most likely diagnosis. Nonetheless, in any case of stricture in the\nsetting of Barrett's esophagus, biopsy to rule out adenacarcinama is necessary.\n(Choice A) Adenocarcinoma generally occurs in patients who have had GERD symptoms for =20 years, and\npresents with weight loss and asymmetric narrowing of the esophageal lumen.\n(Choice B) A hiatal hernia is a protrusion of the stomach above the diaphragm. Fatients may present with\nGERD, and are therefare at risk for Barrett's esophagus, peptic strictures, and adenocarcinoma. Barium\nswallow reveals gastric falds protruding above the diaphragm.\n(Choice C) Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder. Barium swallow typically shows narrowing in a \"bird\ns beak\" pattern at the gastroesophageal junction, plus dilation of the proximal esophagus caused by retention\nof food.\n(Choice E) Vascular rings are a class of uncommaon congenital anomalies in which aortic arch vessels\nencircle the trachea and/or esophagus. Patients may present in infancy with symptoms of airway\nabstruction, though some patients do nat present until adulthood. In adult cases, dysphagia is usually the\npresenting complaint. There is not a strong association with GERD or Barrett's esophagus.\nEducational objective:\nGERD predisposes to Barrett's esophagus, erosive esophagitis and peptic stricture formation. Peptic\nstrictures cause symmetric and circumferential narrowing of the involved esophagus and dysphagia to solids,\nbut no weight lass. Other causes of peptic strictures include radiation, scleroderma, and caustic ingestions."

      "E. Hepatocellular carcinoma"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Painless obstructive jaundice is mare likely to be due to malignancy. Adenocarcinoma of the\nhead of pancreas causes abstruction af extra hepatic bile duct leading to elevation of direct bilirubin and\nmarked icterus. It may be associated with weight loss, dull back pain, and anorexia. There is astranamical\nelevation of alkaline phosphatase. Abdominal examination is usually negative except for mild tenderness in\nepigastric region. CT scan may help in diagnosis. The cancer has got very bad prognosis (Choice D).\n(Choice A) Primary biliary cirrhosis alsa has increased alkaline phosphatase but it usually presents with\nitching and alsa has characteristic anti-mitochondrial antibodies detected on antibody assay.\n(Choice B) Chronic pancreatitis alone does not cause elevation of alkaline phosphatase. The patient alsa\ndoesn't have any chranic abdaminal pain ar evidence of malabsorption.\n(Choices C and E) Both ALT and AST should be high incase of Viral hepatitis and hepato-cellular carcinoma.\nEducational Objective:\nPainless jaundice in an elderly patient should make you think about pancreatic head carcinoma."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is characteristic for inflammatory diarrhea. The typical cause is idiopathic\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Infectious causes are less likely with chronic diarrhea (duration = 4\nweeks) than with acute diarrhea. In this case, the clues to the carrect diagnosis include weight loss, anemia,\nelevated ESR, and reactive thrambocytosis. The positive occult blood test is also a very important\nclue. Furthermore, inflammatory changes in the blood {e.g., anemia, elevated ESR, acute phase reactants,\nreactive thrombocytosis) and blood/leukocyte positive stool are usually absent in the ather types of diarrhea\nmentioned.\n{Choice B) Secretory diarrhea is usually the result of same medication use or hormanal disturbances.\n(Choice C) Osmotic diarrhea is caused by the ingestion of osmatically active, poorly absorbable substances.\nLactose intolerance is a classic example.\n(Choice D) Mator diarrhea is exemplified by hyperthyroidism.\n(Choice E) Factitial diarrhea is typically associated with psychiatric disturbances.\nEducational Objective:\nChronic inflammatory diarrhea is typically associated with inflammatory changes in the blood (anemia,\nelevated ESR, acute phase reactants, reactive thrombocytosis). Blood/leukocyte-positive stoal is another\nimpartant finding."

    "question": "A 35-year-old Hispanic male comes to the office because of excruciating pain during defecation for the past\nweek. The pain is so severe that he avoids using the toilet. He also adds that he has noticed bright red blood\nin his stool. The caliber of his stool has not changed. His past medical history is significant far chronic\nconstipation. Rectal examination shows a posterior mucosal tear of the anus. Which of the following is the\nmast appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A Colonoscopy",
      "B. Local anesthetic and stool softeners",
      "C. Lateral sphincteratomy",
      "D. Antibiotics",
      "E. Gradual dilatation of the sphincter",
      "F. Nitroglycerine ointment"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation of this patient is clearly suggestive of an anal fissure. Anal fissures are slit-like tears\naf the anal canal. These are mostly located on the posterior or anterior anal verge, and are mast commanly\ncaused by the passage of large, hard constipated stools. Other causes are crypt abscess, explosive\ndiarrhea, perianal dermatitis or infection, inflammatory bowel disease, trauma, and sexual abuse. The most\ncomman symptoms are severe pain and bright red rectal bleeding during defecation. The initial treatment of\nboth acute and chranic anal fissures includes dietary modification (e.g., high-fiber diet and large amounts of\nfluids), a stoal softener and a local anesthetic. The local anesthetic relieves the local spasm, and the stool\nsoftener creates soft, bulky, atraumatic stools that disrupt the vicious cycle of constipation and fissure\ndevelopment. This treatment also allows the fissure to heal in approximately 50% of patients.\n(Choice A) Calonascaopy is nat needed in this patient as the bright red blood on defecation is clearly due to\nthe fissure. His stool caliber is also normal. However, if the fissure heals and the patient still has blood in the\nstools, then colonoscopy is warranted.\n(Choice C) Surgical repair of a fissure is indicated in chronic or refractory acute fissures to pravide a wider\naperture for stool to pass and to interrupt the internal sphincter spasm. Lateral sphincterotamy is the\nstandard treatment for chronic fissures.\n{Choice D) Antibiotics have no role in the management of uncomplicated anal fissures.\n(Choice E) Gradual dilatation of the sphincter can also provide a wider aperture far the passage of stoal and\ninterrupt the spasm; however, the extent of sphincter disruption is unpredictable, causing undesirable rates of\nrecurrence and of anal incontinence.\n(Choice F) Mitraglycerin ointment can be used ta relieve the internal sphincter spasm; however, headaches\nand recurrences are commaon.\nEducational Objective:\nThe initial treatment of both acute and chronic anal fissures includes dietary modification (e.g., high-fiber diet\nand large amounts of fluids), a stool softener, and a local anesthetic.\n*Extremely high yield question for the USMLE!]"

It wakes him up during the night and is promptly relieved by a glass of water and a piece\naf bread. He denies vomiting or diarrhea, but has experienced an occasional \"dark stool.\" He has no\nsignificant past medical history and does not take any medications. His family history is significant for biliary\ndisease in his mother and stomach cancer in his father. He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day and\nconsumes a can of beer almast every day.

      "E. No alcohal consumption",
      "F. Selective vagotomy",
      "G. Cholecystectomy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Given his melena and characteristic nocturnal pain that is relieved by eating, this patient most likely has\nduodenal ulcer disease. The pain is thought ta be worse with an empty stomach because of the unopposed\nacidic fluid that empties into the duodenum. The ingestion of food causes alkali solutions to be released into\nthe duodenum and relieves the pain. On the other hand, the pain associated with gastric ulcers tends to\nworsen with eating. There is a very high (aver 80%) prevalence of H. pylori infection in people with duodenal\nulcer disease, so it is very likely that this patient is infected with H. pylori. The mainstay of therapy for\npatients with peptic ulcer disease (FUD) and H. pylori infection is acid suppression and eradication of the\narganism. Antibiotic treatment is often curative for patients with H. pylortassociated PUD. There are\nnumerous possible regimens, but the first-line therapy is amoxicillin plus clarithromycin and a proton pump\ninhibitar.\n(Choice A) Acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor (e g., omeprazole) or a histamine receptor-2 (HZ)\nblocker is the treatment of choice for patients with PUD not attributable to H. pylori. This patient has a\nduodenal ulcer and is therefare very likely to be infected with H. pylori. Although acid suppression is\nimportant far this patient, antibiotics must be used ta eradicate the causal arganism.\n(Choice C) NSAIDs are associated with the development of gastritis and PUD. Giving this patient an NSAID\nis likely to exacerbate his ulcer.\n(Choice D) Smoking is associated with the development of PUD. Interestingly though, smoking is nat\nassociated with ulcer recurrence if H. pylori has been eradicated. Smoking cessation is always encouraged\nbut would not be as effective as antibiotics in treating his PUD.\n(Choice E) Alcohal can irritate the gastric mucosa and lead to gastritis. However, there is no evidence that\nalcohol causes or exacerbates chranic peptic ulcer disease.\n(Choice F) Selective vagotomy decreases gastric acid production by removing vagal input to the\nstomach. With antibiotic regimens for H. pylori and the advent of proton pump inhibitors, selective vagatamy\nis used only in refractory cases. This patient has not yet had a trial of conservative therapy.\nEducational Objective:\nDuodenal ulcer disease typically presents with epigastric pain that improves with eating. Over 90% of\npatients with duodenal ulcer disease are infected with H. pylori. The treatment for H. pylorrassociated ulcers\nis acid suppression and arganism eradication with antibiatics."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is suggestive of multiple myeloma. The combination of back pain, anemia,\nrenal dysfunction, and elevated ESR is very typical for this disorder. Another very characteristic finding is\nhypercalcemia. Bone lysis caused by plasmaocyte-released humaral factors and expanding plasma cell\nmass results in increased serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia may manifest as severe constipation (as in\nthis patient), anorexia, weakness, increased urination, or neurologic abnormalities (e.g., confusion ar\nlethargy). Sometimes, hypercalcemia-induced symptoms may even dominate the clinical picture of multiple\nmyeloma.\n(Choices A, B, D and E) Other common causes of persistent canstipation may include mechanical\nabstruction (e.g., secondary to colon cancer), medications (e.g, anti-chalinergic agents), harmanal\ndisturbances (e.g. hypathyroidism), and same neurologic abnormalities. The signs and symptoms of this\npatient are nat suggestive of any of these problems.\nEducational Objective:\nHypercalcemia is a common finding in a patient with multiple myeloma.

    "answer": "C",
    "image": "",
    "explanation": "Bloody diarrhea in any young patient should make you think about inflammatory bowel disease. Ulcerative\ncolitis may present with a toxic megacolon (as in this case). In such conditions, proctasigmoidascopy and\nbiopsy can quickly make the diagnosis: however, physicians should not wait for these studies before starting\ntreatment when the patient is acutely ill.\n(Choice A) The differential diagnoses of this case includes infectious diarrhea, especially that involving\nCampylobacter, however, infectious diarrhea due to invasive agents is less likely to produce colon\ndistension. Pseudomembranous colitis could lead to toxic megacalon, but this diagnasis is highly unlikely in\nthis patient since there is no previous history of antibiotic use ar recent hospitalization. Anyway,\nproctosigmoidoscopy with biopsy Is also the test of choice in acutely ill patients with suspected\npseudomembranous colitis for quick diagnosis.\nUlcerative calitis thus remains as the mare likely diagnosis, and although stool studies may be helpful in the\ninitial evaluation, these mast probably will not be very sensitive in diagnosing the patient's condition.\n(Choice B) Barium enema is contraindicated in acutely ill and toxic patients.\n{Choice E) CT would not be of much help for confirming the diagnosis.\nEducational Objective:\nProctosigmaidoscopy with biopsy establishes the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. One of its advantages is that\nthis diagnostic test can be performed in acute settings. Fulminant calitis is a serious complication of\nulcerative colitis; plain radiographs can usually reveal the distended calon."

      "E. Hepatic flexure"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In this patient, ischemic colitis most likely occured following the surgical procedure. Patients with extensive\natherosclerotic vascular disease are at particularly high risk, especially if their haspital course is complicated\nby hypatension, which may be due to increased perioperative fluid loss or excessive use of diuretics.\nIn general, the initial presentation of patients with ischemic colitis includes the acute onset of lower abdominal\npain, followed by bloody diarrhea within 12-24 hours. Fever, nausea, vomiting, and extreme leukocytosis with\nleft shift are often seen. The most commanly involved segment of the colon is the splenic flexure, because it\nis supplied by end arteries. The splenic flexure is a 'watershed' line between the territory of the superior and\ninferior mesenteric arteries. There are two watershed zones in the colon: (1) the splenic flexure, which is\nsupplied by narrow terminal branches of the superior mesenteric artery, and (2) the recto-sigmaid junction,\nwhich is supplied by narrow terminal branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. These twa watershed areas\nare most vulnerable to ischemia during systemic hypotensian.\nThere is no specific marker for ischemic colitis. Sometimes, increased levels of lactic acid are\nhelpful. Radiographs are non-specific, but may show classic \"thumb printing.\" It is impartant to distinguish\nischemic colitis from infectious colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and at times, even colon cancer.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect ischemic colitis in patients who have evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease, present with\nabdominal pain followed by bloody diarrhea, and have minimal abdominal exam findings. The most\ncommanly involved segment of the colon is the splenic flexure, because it is supplied by end arteries."

Two\nimpartant clinical clues in this scenario are the characteristic symptoms (i.e. \"sticking sensation in the throat\"\nar dysphagia accompanied by heartburn) and manometric findings (i.e, absence of peristaltic waves in the\nlower two-thirds of the esophagus, and significant decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter tone).\n(Choice A) Manometric findings in achalasia include a significant decrease or absence of peristaltic waves\nand increased LES tone.\n(Choice B) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be associated with dysphagia due to a stricture,\nbut by this stage, heartburn usually disappears or diminishes significantly. The lower esophageal sphincter\n(LES) tone is decreased, but the absence of peristaltic waves is not typical in patients with GERD.\n(Choice D) Mon-ulcer dyspepsia is not usually accompanied by esophageal dysmotility.\n{Choice E) Diffuse esophageal spasm is characterized by chest pain and dysphagia, not\nheartburn. Manometry may reveal periodic. high-amplitude. non-peristaltic waves.\nEducational Objective:\nThe absence of peristaltic waves in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus and significant decrease in lower\nesophageal sphincter (LES) tone are characteristic for esophageal dysmotility associated with scleroderma."

    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This woman most likely has irritable bowel syndrame (IBS), a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder\ncharacterized by a myriad of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, pain\nrelief with bowel movements, looser and mare frequent stoals with the onset of pain, passage of mucus, a\nsense of incomplete emptying, and bloating. There are diarrhea predominant, constipation predominant, and\nmixed subtypes of IBS. Extraintestinal manifestations may include depression, sexual dysfunction and\nurinary changes. Symptoms may be exacerbated by stress. IBS is much mare caomman in women than in\nmen. The exact etiology is unclear but it may be related to a heightened awareness of normal badily\nfunctions. There is no laboratory ar pathologic hallmark of IBS.\n(Choice A) Perianal fistulas are commonly seen in Crohn's disease. This patient does not have severe\nabdominal pain, weight loss, fevers, ar extraintestinal manifestations consistent with Crohn's disease.\n(Choice B) Crypt abscesses are characteristic for ulcerative colitis, a disease associated with abdominal\npain, weight loss, diarrhea with ar without mucus or blood, and low grade fevers. This patient's presentation\nis nat severe enough to pursue a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.\n{Choice C) Folic acid deficiency can occur secondary to poor dietary intake, alcoholism, increased usage, or\nas a drug side effect. It does not usually cause diarrhea.\n(Choice D) A duodenal ulcer typically presents with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal blood\nloss, and anemia. It is not a comman cause of lower abdominal pain or diarrhea.\n(Choice E) Intestinal villous atrophy is the hallmark of celiac sprue, an autoimmune disease that causes\nintolerance to gluten. Patients present with weight loss, bloating, flatulence, and malnutrition. Symptoms are\nstrongly correlated to dietary intake of gluten-cantaining foods. This patient's symptoms do not consistently\ncorrelate with diet.\nEducational objective:\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a functional disarder of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by abdominal pain\nwith diarrhea and/or constipation. There is no laboratory or pathologic hallmark of irritable bowel syndrome."

      "C. Increase dietary fiber intake",
      "D. Explain his surgical options",
      "E. Educate about prophylactic antibiotics"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The incidence of diverticular disease increases with advancing age. A diverticulum, by definition, is a sac-like\nprotrusion of the colonic wall, which develops at points of weakness. Diverticulosis is most often\nasymptomatic, but can alsa present with symptoms such as constipation and abdominal pain. Constipation\ncauses increased pressure in the colon, and this excess pressure can lead to weak spots, thus predisposing\nto the formation of diverticuli. The characteristic colonascopic findings are multiple diverticuli. The best\nmethod of treatment of uncomplicated diverticulasis is by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. The resultant\nlarge, bulky stools decrease the possibility of development of diverticuli by increasing the width af the\ncolon. Bulk laxatives are also helpful.\n(Choices A and B) In general, cutting down on cigarette smoking and alcahal have maximum benefits;\nhowever these do nat have any effect on diverticulosis.\n(Choice D) Surgery is indicated only in the event of complications, such as diverticular bleeding, perforation,\nar peritanitis.\n{Choice E) Bawel rest and antibiotics are administered to patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis.\nDiverticulosis is differentiated from diverticulitis by the absence of fever, leukocytosis, ar other signs of\nperitoneal inflammation. Diverticulosis is best treated only with dietary recommendations.\nEducational Objective:\nAsymptomatic diverticulosis needs only dietary modifications in the form of high fiber intake."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Dyspepsia is defined as pain ar discomfort centered in the upper abdomen. It may be intermittent or\ncontinuous, and may or may not be related to meals. 25% of such patients have peptic ulcer disease. In\n1898, the American Gastraenteralogical Association recommended that patients with dyspepsia, age younger\nthan 45 years, and presentation without any alarming symptoms (e.g., bleeding, anemia, dysphagia, and\nweight loss) should have a noninvasive test for H. pylori (i e_, serologic or breath test).\n(Choice E) Eradication antibiotic therapy against H pyloriis indicated for infected patients anly.\n(Choice C) In young patients with no alarming symptoms and who are H. pylari negative, the\nrecommendation is an empirical trial for one manth of anti-secretory therapy, such as HZ blockers or proton\npump inhibitars, or a prokinetic agent. Gastroenterology referral is required in patients older than 45 years of\nage or those with alarming symptoms at any age, due to the small risk of gastric cancer. Such patients\nshould be considered for endoscopy and H. pylori testing.\n(Choice A) Barium swallow has little role in the routine evaluation of patients with dyspepsia. Although itis\nless expensive than endoscopy for the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease, itis less accurate.\nEducational Objective:\nManinvasive tests for H. pylon should be the first step in the management of patients with dyspepsia under 45\nyears of age who da nat have alarming symptoms."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described in this vignette is suffering from upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This patient has\nsymptoms of anemia and hypovolemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/L and evidence of ongoing bleeding.\nTransfusion of packed red blood cells increases oxygen carrying capacity in patients with low hemoglobin\nlevels. Oxygenation can be maintained above a hemoglobin level of 7 g/L in patients with normal cardiac\nfunction. However, in alder people and patients with cardiac disease, it is prudent to maintain hemoglobin\nlevels above 10 g/L (hematocrit = 30%). Furthermare, blood transfusion is often necessary in patients with\nactive bleeding, as the hemoglobin level will continue to decrease. For these reasons, the patient described\nin this vignette needs to receive a packed red blood cell transfusion.\n{Choice A) Blood is collected from donors as whale blood, but then is separated into packed red blood cells,\nplatelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate. Only the necessary blood product(s) should be ordered,\nrather than whale blood.\n(Choice C) Fresh frozen plasma (FFF) contains all clotting factors and plasma proteins. Transfusion of FFP\nis generally used to reverse a coagulopathy (e.g., to rapidly lower a high INR in a patient taking warfarin).\n(Choice D) Cryoprecipitate is rich in factor Vill, fibrinogen, won Willebrand factor, and Factor Xl. It is used for\npatients with hemaphilia, fibrinogen deficiency, and von Willebrand disease. Although FFP can be used in\nthese patients, cryoprecipitate contains higher levels of these factors in less volume; therefore, it is very\nuseful in volume sensitive patients.\n(Choice E) The risk of spontaneous bleeding does not increase until the platelet count decreases below\n10,000/uL. Even major invasive surgical procedures can be performed in patients with platelet counts of\n50,000/uL. This patient has a platelet count of 130,000/pL and does not require platelet transfusion. Although\nhe takes aspirin that causes platelet dysfunction there is no evidence that platelet transfusion is beneficial in\nthis setting.\n(Choice F) Plasmapheresis, the process of removing a patient's plasma and replacing it with an IV fluid\nsolution, is indicated when a destructive substance (usually an autoantibody) is present in the patient's\nplasma. Plasmapheresis can be used to treat some causes of hemalytic anemia; however, this patient's\nanemia is due to hemorrhage and therefore plasmapheresis will nat be helpful.\n(Choice G) There are no indications for dialysis. Although this patient does have a moderately elevated BUN,\nhe has a normal serum creatinine. Thus, his abnormal BUM is most likely due to dehydration ar\ngastrointestinal bleeding rather than renal failure.\nEducational Objective:\nThe apprapriate blood product ta administer far anemia is packed red blood cells. In patients with preexisting\nheart disease, a hemoglobin level of 10 g/L or higher (hematocrit = 30%) should be maintained."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation of this patient is highly suggestive of celiac disease. Celiac disease presents with\nsymptoms and signs of malabsorption, which include:\n1. characteristically bulky, foul-smelling, floating stool\n2. loss of muscle mass or subcutaneous fat\n3. pallor - due to iron deficiency anemia\n4. bane pain - due to osteomalacia\n5. easy bruising - due ta vitamin K deficiency\nB. hyperkeratosis - due to vitamin A deficiency\nFatigue and weight loss are comman complaints. The diagnosis is confirmed with serological studies such\nas ELISA for IgA antibodies ta gliadin and the immunaofluorescence test far IgA antibodies to endomysium, the\npresence af which is virtually pathognomonic for celiac disease. In addition, antibodies against tissue\ntransglutaminase are highly sensitive and specific.\n(Choice B) Anti-Scl-70 antibodies are associated with scleroderma. Fatients usually present with dysphagia\nrather than malabsorption.\n(Choice C) Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are associated with autoimmune hepatitis and SLE.\n(Choice D) Anti-centromeric antibodies are associated with CREST syndrome.\n(Choice E) Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are associated with primary biliary cirrhosis.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect celiac disease in any patient who presents with malabsarption and iron deficiency anemia.

Her\npast medical histary is unremarkable, and she does not take any other medications. There is na family\nhistory of coronary artery disease. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows nao\nabnormalities. A lipid profile is within normal limits. An EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm. A stress test\nfails to reproduce the symptoms or to induce ST/T wave changes. Chest x-ray, upper Gl endoscopy, and\nechocardiography shows no abnormalities.

      "E. Pulmonary perfusionfventilation scintigraphy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's symptoms (i e., spontaneous pain, adynophagia far cold and hot food) are suggestive af diffuse\nesophageal spasm. Resolution of her chest pain after taking nitroglycerin is also consistent with the\ndiagnosis, because nitrates (and Ca channels blockers) relax not only the myocytes in the vessels but also\nall others, including those in the esophagus, thereby alleviating the pain. Esophagography may ar may not\nshow other anomalies (e.g., corkscrew shape). Esophageal manometry should reveal repetitive, nan-\nperistaltic, high amplitude contractions, either spontaneously or after ergonovine stimulation.\n(Choice C) The patient's clinical picture, along with her test results, have nearly excluded diagnoses with\nserious cardiovascular causes, such as ischemia, cardiomyopathy, valve dysfunction and aortic dissection.\n(Choice D) Radiation of pain to the back and its precipitation by emational stress make the diagnosis of\nmatility disarder more likely than gastroesophageal reflux disease. Esophageal reflux mast cammanly\ncauses burning (heartburn), rather than pain. Furthermore, if GERD was being suspected, the test of choice\nwould be 24-hour pH monitoring (not the Bernstein test), and endoscopy should have shown esophagitis.\n(Choice E) Repetitive pulmonary embolism is unlikely with normal vital signs and no shartness of breath.\nEducational Objective:\nManametry establishes the diagnosis of diffuse esophageal spasm."

Which of the following is the most appropriate\nnext step in the diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A Secretin stimulation test",
      "B. Gastric acid secretion study",
      "C. Serum chromogranin A",
      "D. Calcium infusion study",
      "E. Serum gastrin concentration"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's endoscopic findings (i.e., prominent gastric folds, ulcer located beyond the duodenal bulb) are\ncharacteristic of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma). All patients suspected of having this syndrome\nshould have fasting serum gastrin levels done. A serum gastrin value greater than 1000 pg/mL is diagnostic\naf the disarder. In addition, measurement of gastric pH levels on a single specimen is important to exclude\nthe possibility of secondary hypergastrinemia due to achlorhydria.\n(Choice A) The secretin stimulation test should be done when the patient is suspected of having Zollinger-\nEllison syndrome, but has non-diagnostic fasting serum gastrin levels. Secretin stimulates the release of\ngastrin by gastrinoma cells. Marmal gastric G cells are inhibited by secretin; thus, the administration of\nsecretin should nat cause a rise in serum gastrin concentrations in patients with ather causes of\nhypergastrinemia.\n(Choice B) Although gastric acid secretion studies previously played an important role in the diagnosis of\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, these tests are no langer performed in most major medical centers, and have\nbeen replaced by the other diagnostic modalities, as discussed above.\n(Choice C) Measurement of serum chramagranin A, a general marker for neuroendocrine tumars, is less\nsensitive and specific than measurement of serum gastrin; however, it may be used as a confirmatory test in\ndifficult cases.\n(Choice D) The calcium infusion study is usually reserved for patients with gastric acid hypersecretion who\nare strongly suspected of having gastrinoma despite a negative secretin test. Calcium infusian can lead to\nan increase in serum gastrin levels in patients with gastrinoma.\nEducational Objective:\nAll patients suspected of having Zollinger-Ellisan syndrome should have fasting serum gastrin levels done. A\nserum gastrin value greater than 1000 pg/mL is diagnostic of the disorder. Patients with non-diagnostic\nfasting serum gastrin levels should have a secretin stimulation test done."

    "explanation": "This patient's history is consistent with zinc deficiency (Choice B). Zinc is an essential mineral, and is found\nin animal pratein, whale grains, beans and nuts. Itis digested primarily in the jejunum. This patient is at risk\nfor both dietary deficiency and impaired absarption of zinc. Some total parenteral nutrition (TPN) formulations\nlack zinc, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at risk for impaired absorption of zinc. In addition\nto his risk factors for zinc deficiency, this patient's symptoms are also consistent with deficiency. Zinc\ndeficiency may cause alopecia, abnormal taste, bullous, pustulous lesions surrounding body orifices and/or\nthe extremities, and impaired wound healing. In children, it may also cause growth retardation.\n(Choice A) Celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to gluten which affects the small bowel Symptoms\ninclude diarrhea, weight loss and fatigue. It may also lead to malabsorption of vitamin D, K, B12, calcium,\nfalic acid, and zinc.\n(Choice C) Vitamin A deficiency may be caused by nutritional deficiency or malabsorption. Symptoms\ninclude blindness, dry skin, and impaired immunity.\n(Choice D) Vitamin B12 is contained in animal products. Deficiency results in macracytic anemia and\nneurologic symptoms.\n(Choice E) Selenium deficiency, like zinc deficiency, may result from chronic TPM. It may also result from\nmalabsarption ar malnutrition (food sources include nuts, meat, and fish). The mast important feature of\ndeficiency is cardiomyopathy.\n(Choice F) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease which may present\nwith malar and discoid rashes, aral ulcers, and alopecia. Fever, weight loss, arthritis, as well as renal,\nneurologic, and hematalogic symptoms are also comman.\nEducational objective:\nZinc deficiency may result from chronic total parenteral nutrition or malabsorption.

Physical examination is unremarkable. A lateral x-ray film of the chest shows extreme\ndilatation of the esophagus with an air fluid level. Which of the following is the diagnostic test for this patient's\ncondition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Barium swallow",
      "B. Endoscopy",
      "C. PH monitoring",
      "DO. Manometry",
      "E. CT scan"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is mast likely suffering from achalasia. The recent onset of dysphagia to bath solids and liquids\nis characteristic. Reflux of food particles fram the esophagus at night may lead to aspiration symptoms, as in\nthis case. The typical radiologic finding shows a dilated esophagus with an air fluid level. Manaometry is the\nbest diagnostic tool, since it can demonstrate failure of the distal lower esophageal sphincter to relax, as well\nas the absence of peristaltic contractions in the upper esophagus.\n{Choice A) Barium swallow will reveal a large dilated esophagus with a bird's beak tapering at the distal\nend. This is not diagnostic of achalasia because a tumar or stricture of the esophagus may also look very\nsimilar. Barium swallow is helpful in the evaluation of esophageal cancers. Although such cancers also\npresent as dysphagia to both solids and liquids, the age of onset is typically much later in life than\nachalasia. Furthermore, the presenting dysphagia is initially wath solids anly, progressing to that\nwith liquids. In canclusion, barium swallow is done to rule out any internal masses of the esophagus that\nmay cause an obstruction. Barium swallow is not diagnostic of any pathology, but may give a hint of the\npathology.\n(Choice B) Endoscopy alone is not diagnostic of achalasia. Endoscopy will reveal undigested food particles\nin the esaphagus, as well as any strictures or foreign bodies. Biopsies are obtained ta rule out cancer. In\nachalasia, the biopsies will reveal the absence of the myenteric plexus.\n(Choice C) pH manitoring is used to make a diagnasis of reflux. It has no role in the diagnosis of\nachalasia. Because of the narrowed portion of the esophagus, reflux is not associated with achalasia.\n{Choice E) CT scan is not used in the diagnosis of achalasia. CT scan may be helpful if there is a tumor in\nthe esophagus. It will define the extent of involvement and any local or distant spread.\nEducational Objective:\nThe diagnosis of achalasia is made by manometry, however, endoscopy is required ta ensure that there is no\nmalignancy."

It is important to distinguish between these two\nconditions as their natural history and management differ significantly. MNon-caseating granulomas are\npathognomanic of CO as compared to UC; however, these are present in anly 80% of patients with\nCD. Granulomas may alsa be seen in patients with gastrointestinal TB, sarcoidosis, and Yersinia\ninfection. Other characteristic features of CO are transmural involverment of the colon, skip lesions,\ncobblestone appearance of the calon, creeping fatty appearance of mesentery, fistulas, fissures, and perianal\ndisease.\n(Choice A) Crypt abscesses are characteristic of UC; however, they are not pathognomonic.\n(Choice B) Abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea is the most comman complaint of patients with UC. Patients\nwith CO may have a similar presentation if the disease involves the calon; however, in general, patients with\nCD have one of twa patterns of disease - either a fibrostenatic obstructing pattern, or a penetrating fistulous\npattern.\n{Choice D) UC is limited ta the colon and most cammaonly involves the rectum; however, it may sometimes\ninvolve the terminal ileum (backwash ileitis). CD can affect any part of the intestinal tract from the mouth to\nthe anus, but is mast caommanly limited ta the terminal ileum. Nevertheless, it may cause salitary calitis in 15-\n20% of patients.

Blood or coffee-ground-like material on\nnasogastric tube lavage can confirm this clinical diagnosis; however, the lavage may be negative if bleeding\nhas ceased, or if it arises beyond a closed pylorus. The management of mast bleeding ulcers include fluid\nand blood resuscitation, medical therapy, and endoscopic intervention, as deemed appropriate. Mast\nbleeding peptic ulcers will stop bleeding spontaneously, and will nat rebleed during hospitalization.\n(Choices A, B and C) There are three other major complications af peptic ulcer: perforation, penetration and\nabstruction; however, these are less common than bleeding.\n(Choice E) Atrophic gastritis is not a complication of peptic ulcer disease.\nEducational Objective:\nHemarrhage is the most cammon complication of peptic ulcer disease."

    "question": "A 56-year-old woman with cirrhosis presents with a 2-week history of increasing abdominal distension. She\nhas mild encephalopathy and esophageal varices without bleeding. Her cirrhosis is due to chronic hepatitis\ntype B. She has a past history of ascites treated successfully with conservative management. She is\ncurrently on sodium, water and protein restriction, maximal doses of spironolactone and furosemide, and\nlactulose. Her temperature is 36 6C {97 .8F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and\nrespirations are 30/min. She has a flapping tremor and labored breathing. Abdominal examination shows\nmarked abdominal distension. An x-ray film of the chest is unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound shows\nperitoneal fluid and splenomegaly, liver hyperechogenicity and nodularity, and portal vein width of 16 mm; no\nmasses are evident. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this\npatient's ascites?",
    "options": [
      "A. Intravenous furosemide therapy",
      "B. Tapping of some amount of ascitic fluid",
      "C. Peritoneo-jugular shunt",
      "D. Distal spleno-renal shunt (selective shunt)",
      "E. Side-to-side porto-caval shunt (non-selective shunt)"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The treatment of ascites starts with Na+ and water restriction (2 L/day). Diuretic therapy, if needed is\ntypically started with spironolactone. When the maximal dose of spironolactone fails to improve the patient's\nstatus, giving a loop diuretic (e.g. furosemide) is recommended. Aggressive diuresis (= 1 Liday) is not\nrecommended due ta the risk of hepato-renal syndrome.\nIn this case, slow tapping of up ta 2-4L of ascitic fluid daily (withiwithout albumin infusion) is the best next\nconservative measure; however, renal function should be frequently monitored. Less aggressive\nparacentesis is recommended in patients with barderline renal function.\n(Choice A) This patient has already received the maximal medical therapy for ascites (Ma, water restriction,\nspironalactone and furosemide). Further aggressive diuretic treatment may worsen the encephalopathy or\nprecipitate hepato-renal syndrome.\n(Choices C, D and E) Vascular shunts are generally indicated for symptomatic varices (i.e, after first\nbleeding). Distal spleno-renal shunting will nat improve the ascites, and may actually warsen it. Side-to-side\nporto-caval shunt will imprave the ascites, but may warsen the encephalopathy. Feritoneo-jugular shunt is\ndesigned far the treatment of ascites only. Feritonitis, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation\nare its major drawbacks.\nEducational Objective:\nKnow the stepwise approach of the treatment far ascites:\n1. Sodium and water restriction\n2. Spironolactone\n3. Loop diuretic (not more than 1 Liday of diuresis)\n4. Frequent abdominal paracentesis (2 - 4 Lfday, as lang as the renal function is okay)"

    "question": "A 44-year-old male who has had an extensive small bowel resection for Crohn's disease has been on total\nparenteral nutrition for two years. He presented to the hospital with epigastric and right upper quadrant\npain. He has been taking azathioprine. His vital signs are within normal limits.

      "C. Impaired gallbladder contraction",
      "D. Increased enterohepatic recycling of bile acids"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Because the gastrointestinal tract is bypassed in patients an total parenteral nutrition (TPN) the stimulus for\nthe release of gastrointestinal harmanes such as cholecystokinin (CCK) is impaired. Normal stimuli far the\nrelease of cholecystokinin include the presence af proteins and fatty acids in the duodenum; this stimulus is\nabsent in patients being nourished with TPN. CCK normally stimulates contraction of the gall bladder and\nexpulsion of bile into the gut lumen. Without CCK. gall bladder stasis results and bile sludge forms in the gall\nbladder predisposing to cholecystitis.\n(Choice A) Estrogen promotes the farmation of cholesterol gall stones by stimulating the activity of HMG-CoA\nreductase.\n(Choice B) Increased red blood cell destruction (hemalytic anemia) can result in pigment gall stone\nformation by increasing the amount of heme requiring degradation to bilirubin.\n(Choice D) Increased enterohepatic recycling of bile acids would not predispose to gall stone\nformation. Decreased enterohepatic recycling of bile acids can predispose to cholesterol gall stone farmatian\nas is observed in Crohn's disease.\nEducational objective:\nTPM causes gall bladder stasis and predisposes to both gall stone formation and bile sludging, both af which\nmay lead to cholecystitis."

      "E. Liver pathology"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "image": "",
    "explanation": "This patient's symptoms, history and CT scan are very suggestive of pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is mast\ncommanly caused by alcohol ingestion, followed by gallstones. Drug-induced pancreatitis accounts for 5% of\ncases. Abdominal pain is the mast common symptom. The diagnosis can be established by measuring\nserum amylase and lipase levels. CT scan shows diffuse or focal parenchymal changes, edema, necrosis\nar liquefaction. The treatment is supportive care with fluids and electrolyte replacement.\nIn this case, the most likely diagnosis is drug-induced pancreatitis. Furthermore, the most likely culprit\nis valproic acid, which is an anti-seizure medication that has been associated with pancreatitis. Most cases\naf drug-induced pancreatitis are mild. Other comman drugs that can cause pancreatitis (and are very\nimpartant to know for the USMLE) are:\n1. diuretics — furosemide, thiazides\n2. drugs for inflammatory bowel disease — sulphasalazine, 5-ASA\nJ. immunosuppressive agents — azathioprine, L-asparaginase\n4. drugs used by patients with a history of seizures or bipolar disorder — valproic acid\n5. drugs used by AIDS patients — think about didanasine, pentamidine\nB. antibiotics — metronidazole, tetracycline\n(Choice A) Gallstones which migrate into the bile duct or at the ampulla of Vater can cause obstruction,\nthereby resulting in gallstone pancreatitis. Fatients with this condition can present with acute pancreatitis,\nwhich can be very severe. Ultrasound can be used to assess gallstone pancreatitis and comman bile duct\nabstruction. The size and number of stones can be determined by this technique. The gallstone may be\nremoved by ERCP, and ance the pancreatitis is resolved, the gallbladder can be removed. Acute\ncholecystitis is best diagnosed with a nuclear (HIDA) scan. In the above CT scan image, the patient's\ngallbladder shadow is not enlarged, and there is na evidence of gallbladder inflammation.\n(Choice B) Pyelonephritis is a common infectious condition that can present with abdominal pain, fever,\nchills and nausea. It is seen more frequently in women and is usually caused by gram-negative\narganisms. Acute pyelonephritis usually responds to antibiotic therapy far 1 - 2 weeks. Gram-negative\nsepsis (endaotoxic shock) is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of untreated urinary tract\ninfections. The CT scan above shows normal kidneys.\n{Choice D) The above CT scan shows a distended stomach with air. Air in the stomach is commonly seen\nwith ileus. Pancreatitis causes ileus, which results in stasis of the Gl tract. The condition usually resalves an\nits awn. When a large amount of air is present in the stomach, nausea and vamiting may occur. In such a\ncase, a nasogastric tube will resalve the ileus.\n(Choice E) A CT scan is very useful for imaging the liver. It can be used to detect liver masses, nodules,\nabscesses and hemangiomas. Metastatic lesions from colon cancer and elsewhere are rapidly diagnosed\nwith a CT scan. The strength of the CT scan remains in providing a good, detailed overview when\nassessment of the whale abdomen and thorax is needed. However, when it comes to the preoperative\ndifferential diagnosis of liver tumors and assessment of resectability, MR! is the gold standard. The liver\nappears entirely normal in the above CT scan.\nEducational Objective:\nDrug-induced pancreatitis is mild and usually resolves with supportive care. CT scan is diagnostic for\npancreatitis. Remember the following scenarios for drug-induced pancreatitis:\n1. Patient an diuretics — furosemide, thiazides.\n2. Patient with inflammatory bowel disease — sulphasalazine, 5-ASA.\nJ. Patient on immunosuppressive agents — azathioprine L-asparaginase.\n4 Patient with a history of seizures or bipolar disorder — valproic acid.\n8. AIDS patient — didanosine, pentamidine.\n8. Patient on antibiotics — metronidazole, tetracycline."

The risk of bleeding while an warfarin\ntherapy is greatest in patients with risk factors such as diabetes, age > 60, hypertension and alcohalism. A\nsupratherapeutic INR also increases one's risk of hemorrhage, although in the case of retroperitoneal\nhematomas, even therapeutic-range INRs confer significant risk. This patient's back pain should put\nretroperitoneal hematoma high on the differential, and warrants an abdominal CT. The above CT image\nreveals a large isodense collection in the right retroperitoneum, which lies anterior to the psoas muscle and\ndisplaces the right kidney anteriorly. The CT findings are consistent with a spontaneous retroperitoneal\nhematoma (Choice C).\n(Choice A) The classic triad of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is hematuria, abdominal mass and flank\npain. n abdominal CT, RCC presents as a lesion within the kidney parenchyma that enhances with\ncontrast administration. The above lesion is extrinsic to the kidney.\n(Choice B) A vertebral fracture could certainly cause back pain, and may occur in osteoporotic patients in\nthe absence of trauma. However, the above CT image does not depict a vertebral abnormality.\n(Choice D) Hydronephrosis is a condition in which the renal pelvis dilates due ta distal obstruction of the\ngenitourinary system. Patients present with flank pain. CT scan in hydronephrosis demonstrates dilation of\nthe renal pelvis, and may help in identifying the source of obstruction (e.g. kidney stones).\n(Choice E) Mesenteric ischemia presents with abdominal pain out of proportion to physical exam findings. It\nis most commaon in elderly patients, and may result from a cardiac embolus (as in atrial fibrillation), arterial\nthrombosis (as in atherosclerosis), or other etiology (as in shock or vasoconstriction). CT findings include\nbowel wall thickening, pneumatosis intestinalis, and mesenteric thrombi.\nEducational objective:\nAnticoagulation with warfarin places patients at risk for hemorrhage. Retroperitoneal hematoma may occur\neven without a supratherapeutic INR. Back pain and signs and symptoms of hemodynamic compromise\nshould raise suspicion for retroperitoneal hematoma."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "An alcoholic patient presenting with chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea is classic for chronic\npancreatitis. This disorder, resulting from chronic inflammation of the pancreas, is characterized by\nabdominal pain and symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency usually manifests first as\nexocrine dysfunction, with patients experiencing diarrhea due to fat malabsarption. However, the condition\nmay progress ta include diabetes from pancreatic endocrine failure. Weight lass from chronic diarrhea is\ncomman.\nThe diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis can be somewhat tricky. Serum amylase and lipase concentrations\nmay be madestly elevated but are mare commonly normal. This is because there is significant fibrosis and\nanly patchy inflammation in chronic pancreatitis (as opposed ta the widespread inflammation seen in acute\npancreatitis). Stool elastase measurement can be beneficial in diagnosing malabsorption secondary to\npancreatic exocrine insufficiency. This test is the most sensitive and specific test for pancreatic insufficiency\nand requires anly ane stoal sample.\n(Choice A) The D-xylose absorption test is used to diagnose a variety of carbohydrate malabsarptive\nsyndromes. This test is typically normal in patients with pancreatic insufficiency because pancreatic\nenzymes are not required for xylose to be absorbed.\n{Choice C) Radigisotape (HIDA) scanning is used ta diagnose acute chalecystitis.\n(Choice D) Serum CA 13-3 and CEA levels are elevated in a number of upper gastrointestinal tumors. They\nare used ta follow response to therapy or disease recurrence but should not be used to diagnose a neoplasm.\n{Choice E) Upper Gl endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or EGD) is used to diagnose luminal\ndefects in the upper Gl system. In particular, EGD can be helpful in evaluating patients with peptic ulcer\ndisease, gastritis, dysphagia, or upper Gl bleeds. An EGD may be a reasonable future test for this patient if\nhe continues ta have abdominal pain and proves nat ta have chronic pancreatitis.\n(Choice G) This patient has symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency, not hepatic failure.\nEducational Objective:\nChronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition characterized by chronic abdominal pain and pancreatic\ninsufficiency.

    "explanation": "The patient has a rare pancreatic tumor called VIPoma. VIPomas are cancerous tumors that\naffect cells in the pancreas that produce vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIF). VIFomas cause diarrhea,\nhypokalemia resulting in leg cramps, and a decrease in the amount of acid in the stomach. The cause is not\nknown VIPomas are diagnosed mast cammanly at age 50 or so. Women are mare likely ta be affected than\nmen. Other symptoms include dehydration, abdominal pain and cramping, weight loss, facial flushing and\nredness. High level of VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) in the blood is diagnostic.

The patient in\nthis case appears to have no issues with ainvay patency and breathing; however, his circulation\nseems compromised, as suggested by hypotension, pallar, tachycardia and delayed capillary refill. For these\nreasans, the next step in management is fluid resuscitation. Once the patient's hemodynamic status is\nstabilized, more specific treatment can be initiated.\n{Choices B and C) The patient's clinical features and past medical history are very suggestive of upper Gl\nbleeding. Aspiration of blood ar coffee-ground-like material on nasogastric lavage can confirm this clinical\ndiagnosis; however, the result may be negative if the bleeding has ceased or arises beyond a closed\npylorus. The majority of peptic ulcer bleeds will stop spontaneously, and most will not rebleed during\nhospitalization; nevertheless, endoscopy is advocated as the next procedure of choice since it is diagnostic,\ntherapeutic, and may prevent rebleeding. Other benefits of endoscopy include ease of use, wide availability,\nand low cost, as compared to angiographic ar surgical methods.\n(Choice D) Studies have shown significantly less recurrent bleeding in patients receiving protan pump\ninhibitors such as pantoprazole; however, studies on HZ antaganists have been disappointing.\n{Choice A) Somatostatin or its long-acting analogue octreatide acts by reducing splanchnic blood flow,\ninhibiting gastric acid secretion, and exerting gastric cytoprotective effects.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Acute erosive gastritis is characterized by the development of severe hemorrhagic erasive lesions after the\nexposure of gastric mucosa to various injurious agents or after a substantial reduction in blood\nflow. Aspirin decreases the protective prostaglandin production. In addition, aspirin and alcohol cause direct\nmucosal injury (as in this case). Acute mucosal injury decreases the normal protective barriers (decreased\nlevels of secreted mucins and bicarbonate, and decreased integrity of the epithelium), thus permitting acid\nand other luminal substances (e.g. proteases and bile acids) to penetrate into the lamina propria, thereby\ncausing additional injury to the vasculature and subsequent hemorrhage. As in this case, patients may\nmanifest with hematemesis and abdominal pain.\n{Choice A) Esophageal variceal bleeding is the other common cause of upper Gl bleeding, but it is seen in\npatients with liver disease. This patient is a young, occasional drinker and has nao other findings suggestive of\nIver disease.\n(Choice C) Mallory-Weiss tears occur in the distal esophagus at the gastro-esophageal junction after repeat\nbouts of retching and vamiting. Mo such histary is given in this case.\n(Choice D) This patient has no other signs suggestive of fulminant hepatic failure, which would be\ncharacterized by hepatic encephalapathy.\n(Choice E) Platelet dysfunction might be an aggravating factor in this patient's bleeding since he took large\namounts of aspirin, however, platelet dysfunction by itself cannot cause erosive gastritis.\nEducational Objective:\nMassive doses of aspirin and NSAIDs can cause acute erosive gastritis and upper Gl bleeding. Alcahal can\naggravate their effect."

Her treatment regimen\nwas amended three days ago, when furosemide was added to spironolactone and sodium/fwater\nrestriction. However, her distension persists, and today she is very somnalent and has passed very little\nurine. Her past medical history is remarkable for chronic hepatitis type B, cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and 2\nbleeding episodes from esophageal varices; the bleeding was controlled with sclerotherapy. Her temperature\nis 36 .5C (97 BF), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. Abdominal\nexamination shows distension, shifting dullness, and no tenderness; bowel sounds are present.

      "B. Careful volume loading and discontinuation of furosemide and spironolactone",
      "C. Tapping of ascites",
      "D. Renal biopsy",
      "E. Intravenous pyelography"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hepato-renal syndrome is characterized by functional renal failure and hepatic failure. The typical patient\npresents with severe liver disease, hypotension, hyponatremia, azotemia, and oliguria with normal urinalysis\n(as in this case). The exact pathogenesis is not clear; however, the condition is speculated to have resulted\nfram renal arteriolar vasoconstriction. It could be precipitated (but not caused) by hypovolemia due to\ndiuretics, bleeding, and tapping of a large volume of ascites without concomitant albumin infusion. There is no\navailable treatment far hepato-renal syndrome. Measures are taken to withhold all possible precipitating\nfactors and to optimize the liver function, if possible. Initial management includes careful volume loading to\nsee whether the renal function will improve. For this patient, careful volume loading and discontinuation of\nfurosemide and spironolactone are the next steps in management.\nThis patient's renal failure may also be due to other causes, such as hypovalemia (without hepato-renal\nsyndrome) or acute tubular necrosis due to hypovolemia. Acute tubular necrosis (ATH) is less likely (though\nnot excluded) in this patient because his urinalysis is normal. Furthermare, patients with ATM typically have\nmuddy brown granular casts in the urinalysis.\n(Choices D and E) The findings in renal biopsy and intravenous pyelography are normal in hepato-renal\nsyndrome.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect hepato-renal syndrome in a patient with severe liver disease, hypotension, hyponatremia, azatemia,\nand aliguria with normal urinalysis. Take measures to withhold all possible precipitating factors. Initial\nmanagement includes careful volume loading."

    "question": "An 83-year-old woman presents with a 1-year history of progressively severe crampy abdominal pain after\neating. She has started avoiding food because of the pain. The pain is often associated with bloating,\nnausea, and occasional diarrhea. She has had a 15 kg (33lb) weight loss aver the past year. Her other\nmedical problems include hypertension, diabetes mellitus-type 2, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular\ndisease, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Social history is not significant. Abdomen is soft,\nnontender and non-distended. Abdominal x-ray and CT scan are unremarkable. Which of the following is the\nmost likely diagnosis?",

      "G. Amyloidosis",
      "H. Intestinal lymphoma"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Mumerous disorders may lead to dyspeptic symptoms and weight loss, but only a few present with severe\nabdominal pain. Worsening postprandial pain that leads to avoidance of food is characteristic of chronic\nacclusian of visceral arteries (abdominal angina). In this vignette, the patient has evidence af generalized\natherosclerosis which further raises suspicion for atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries (Choice\nB). Routine imaging studies are usually not informative. Diagnosis requires angiography or a Doppler\nultrasound.\n(Choices A and C) Fain accompanied by malabsorption may be due to chronic pancreatitis ar Crohn's\ndisease. However, these diseases usually produce abnormal CT and x-ray findings.\n(Choice D) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) does not lead to weight loss. IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion. In\nthis case, you should nat make this diagnasis - especially with the above presentation.\n(Choice E) Celiac disease is due to gluten sensitivity and it usually presents between 10-40 years of\nage. These patients present with features of malabsarption-like chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea and\nflatulence. Abdominal angina is not a feature af this entity.\n(Choice F) Chalelithiasis presents with right upper quadrant pain and fatty food intolerance. It does nat\ncause chranic diarrhea and weight loss.\n(Choices G and H) Amyloidosis and intestinal lymphoma are unlikely in the above patient.\nEducational objective:\nThe diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia is suspected in patients with unexplained chronic abdominal\npain, weight loss, and food aversion. Evidence of associated atheroscleratic disease is usually\npresent. Physical findings are usually nonspecific. Abdominal examination may reveal a bruit (50 % of\npatients)."

These symptoms occur after ingesting dairy products. She has not had any\nweight loss. She has not had bone pain or easy bruising. Physical examination shows abdominal distention\nand borborygmi. You decide to investigate the patient further. Which of the following test results is most\nlikely to be observed?",

      "D. Alkaline stoal pH",
      "E. Positive acid steatocrit test"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Lactase is a brush border enzyme that hydrolyses lactose. Its concentration declines steadily as one ages\ninto adulthood, especially in peaple of non-European ancestry. When there is an inability to absorb lactose\nfound in milk and dairy products, the condition is called lactose intolerance. This is most commonly seen in\nAsian-Americans (90%). Patients typically manifest with osmotic diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating and\nflatulence after ingestion of such products.\nPreviously, the lactose tolerance test was used to aid in the diagnosis of patients. This test is based an\nmeasurement of the blood glucose level after oral lactose administration. The lactose tolerance testis\ncumbersome and time consuming. Currently, the lactose hydrogen breath test has largely replaced the\nlactose tolerance test. A positive hydrogen breath test is characterized by a rise in the measured breath\nhydrogen level after the ingestion of lactase, thus indicating bacterial carbohydrate metabalism.\n(Choice A) Urine test for reducing substances is positive in patients with glucosuria, galactosuria, etc. Those\nare not characteristic features of lactose intolerance.\n(Choice B) The diarrhea secondary to lactase deficiency has a high osmotic gap, due to the unmetabalized\nlactose and organic acids. The osmatic gap is calculated as 290 - [2 (stoal Na + stool K)] and is greater than\n50 mOsm/kg in all forms of osmotic diarrhea.\n{Choice D) The stool pH is acidic in lactase deficiency due to the fermentation products.\n(Choice E) Acid steatocrit is a test for fat malabsorption, not carbohydrate malabsorption.\nEducational Objective:\nLactose intolerance is characterized by a positive hydrogen breath test, positive stool test for reducing\nsubstances, low stool pH and increased stool osmatic gap. There is na steatarrhea."

      "C. Stoal cultures",
      "D. Cytotoxin assay in the stool",
      "E. Observation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient was treated with antibiotics perioperatively; therefore, he is predisposed to having antibiotic-\nassociated diarrhea. Clostridium difficile is the typical cause of antibiatic-associated diarrhea, although ather\ncauses (E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella) should not be overlooked. The typical clinical scenario of Clostridium\ndifficile-induced colitis includes diffuse, watery (usually non-bloody) diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and\nabdominal tenderness. The pathogenesis involves secretion of a toxin by C. difficile, which is toxic to\nintestinal epitheliocytes. The cytotoxin can be detected in the stool with high sensitivity. The treatment of\nchoice is oral metranidazale. Oral (nat IV) vancomycin can alsa be used; however vancomycin use is\nassociated with the emergence of vancamycin-resistant enteracocci, and is also expensive compared to\nmetronidazole.\n(Choice B) Pseudomembranes in the rectosigmoid area farm in approximately 50% of cases of antibiotic-\nassociated diarrhea. These pseudomembranes can be visualized with endoscopy. The higher sensitivity of\nthe C. difficile assay test makes it the more preferred diagnostic test.\n(Choice C) Stool cultures are usually positive far Clostridium difficile, but are very time-consuming.\n(Choice A) Blood cultures are usually obtained in hospitalized patients who develop fever of unknown origin\nar any evidence of bacteremia; however, this patient most likely has Clostridium difficile diarrhea, which is not\nidentified by blood cultures.\n(Choice E) Failure to institute the appropriate treatment is dangerous, with mortality approaching 20% in\nmaderate-to-severe cases of pseudamembranous colitis.\nEducational Objective:\nConsider Clostridium difficile diarrhea in all patients wha have received antibiotics and develop nausea,\nvomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and elevated white count. Clostridium difficile is the typical cause of\nantibiotic-associated diarrhea. Cytatoxin assay in the stoal is a highly sensitive test to diagnose this condition.\n*Extremely high yield question for the USMLE!]"

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presents with painless intermittent rectal bleeding. The bleeding is bright red in\ncolar. She does not have abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She has a histary of hypertension, diabetes\nmellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Her temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg,\npulse is B0/min, and respirations are 16/min.

    "options": [
      "A Vascular ectasia",
      "B. Diverticulosis",
      "C. Ischemic colitis",
      "DO. Carcinoma calon",
      "E.Hemarrhoids"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has angiodysplasia {also known as vascular ectasia). This condition is the second\nmast camman cause of lower Gl bleeding in elderly patients. Such patients typically present with painless\nbleeding. The presence of aortic stenosis makes the diagnosis of angiodysplasia mare likely since well-\ndefined associations have been established between these two conditions. Anather well-recognized\nassociation is renal failure. Ectasias can present throughout the colon; however, the most often site\naf bleeding is the cecum ar ascending colon. The colonoscopic finding of a cherry red fern-like pattern of\nblood vessels that appear to radiate from a central feeding vessel is diagnostic.\n(Choice B) The most commaon cause of lower Gl bleed in elderly patients is diverticulosis. It is difficult to\nclinically differentiate between angiodysplasia and diverticulosis since both are common causes of lower Gl\nbleeding in elderly patients (aged 65 years or older), and both can present as painless Gl\nbleeding. Nevertheless, colonoscopic findings are diagnostic for these twa conditions. Patients with\ndiverticulosis will have colonoscopic findings of multiple diverticuli with a diverticular bleed. Furthermore,\nmast diverticula are located in the sigmoid colon; therefore, sigmoidoscopy would have shown these.\n(Choice C) Ischemic colitis is unlikely in the absence of abdominal pain. Findings on colonoscopy are\nfriable, edematous mucosa, especially in the region of splenic flexure.\n(Choice D) Even though colon cancer is a possibility, sigmoidoscopy did nat show any\nsuggestive mass. Furthermore, the association with aartic stenosis makes angiodysplasia the mare likely\ndiagnosis.\n{Choice E) Hemorrhoids would be a likely diagnosis in a younger patient. Furthermore, her physical\nexamination is normal, except for a systalic ejection murmur.\nEducational Objective:\nThe two most common causes of painless Gl bleeding in an elderly patient over 65 years of age are\ndiverticulosis and angiodysplasia. There is a well-defined association between aortic stenasis and\nangiodysplasia.\n*Extremely high yield question for the USMLE!"

    "question": "A 45-year-old white male comes to your office for evaluation of diarrhea of 8-months duration. He says that he has lost almost 15 Ibs during the past 8 months. He denies any blood in the stools. 24-hour stool collection reveals fecal fat of 10 gm/day. Stoal microscopy reveals no pathogens and no leucocytes. D-xylose test was performed which shows that less than 2 grams of D-xylose is excreted in urine in 5 hours. D-xylose test was re-performed after 4-week treatment with antibiotics but excretion is still less than 2 grams in 5 hours. Based on these findings, what is the mast likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lactose intolerance",
      "B. Bacterial overgrowth",
      "C. Pancreatic insufficiency",
      "D. Celiac disease",
      "E. Terminal ileal disease"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Lactose intolerance may result in chronic diarrhea, but fecal fat will not be high in such causes (Choice A). Bacterial overgrowth, pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease and Crohn's disease all result in chronic diarrhea with increased fecal fat content. D-xylose is a simple sugar. It does not need to undergo any digestive process befare it can be absorbed. Its absorption requires an intact mucasa only. In narmal individuals, after ingestion of 25 grams of D-xylase, its urinary excretion will be greater than 4 5 grams in 5 hours. In pancreatic insufficiency, there is deficiency of pancreatic enzymes, which lead ta impaired digestion of fats. D-xylose absorption remains unimpaired, as there is no damage to small intestinal mucasa (Choice C). In terminal ileal disease, bile salts are decreased due to impaired enterohepatic circulation, and as a result absarption af fats will be impaired. D-xylose is absorbed in the proximal small bowel and it does nat require bile salts for absorption (Choice E). In bacterial overgrowth there will be bath impaired fat absarption due to bacterial de-conjugation of bile salts as well as decreased excretion of xylose due to bacterial consumption of the simple sugar. In such cases, urinary excretion of xylose returns to narmal after treatment with antibiotics. In the above case, urinary exertion of D-xylose does not increase after treatment with antibiotics and bacterial overgrowth is therefore ruled out. Celiac disease damages small intestinal mucosa, thus impairing O-xylose absarption (Choice D).\nEducational objective:\nD-xylose absorption is abnormal both in bacterial overgrowth and celiac disease. However, with bacterial avergrowth, the test becomes narmal after antibiotic treatment.\n22% of people answered this question carrectly;                                      Last updated: [3/6/2010]\nCopyright ® USMLEWORLD LLC.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical features (i.e intermittent abdominal distention, flatulence, greasy stoals) are very suggestive of a malabsarption syndrome called celiac disease. This disease may go undetected in patients with mild disease, and in thase wha have mild and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and iran deficiency. Iran is predominantly absorbed in the duodenum; hence, iran deficiency anemia is one of the mast common presentations of celiac sprue. In addition, a skin condition termed as dermatitis herpetiformis has been associated in approximately 24% of cases of celiac disease (including this patient).\nDermatitis herpetiformis is a rare. chronic. intensely burning. and pruritic papulovesicular skin disease. Itis commaonly associated with subclinical gluten-sensitive enteropathy. It is characterized by granular IgA deposits in the upper dermis; therefore, testing for IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (best test) and 19G/1gA antigliadin antibodies can be performed when this condition is being suspected.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Fancreatic cancer should always be considered in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Although both pathologies may present with epigric pain, findings suggestive of malignancy include older age, jaundice and weight loss (as in this patient). Pancreatic cancer is more common in people aver the age of 65 years. In addition, labaratory findings may also help distinguish between these two diagnoses. Mildly elevated levels of amylase and lipase are consistent with chronic pancreatitis; however, other findings may indicate an additional pathalogic entity. Elevated levels of serum hilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are suggestive of compression of the intrapancreatic partion of the bile duct, which may be due to edema, fibrosis, or malignancy of the pancreas.\nAbdominal ultrasound is the recommended initial investigation of chaice in a patient with jaundice. Sonographic findings suggestive of pancreatic tumar include dilated bile ducts ar a mass in the head of the pancreas.

This patient most likely has peritonitis with secondary paralytic ileus. He has clear signs of peritoneal fluid {fluctuating wave and shifting dullness), which indicate ascites. In this scenario, diagnostic paracentesis is the simplest test to perform.

    "question": "A 49-year-old woman presents with a two-week history of lower abdominal pain and severe diarrhea. The stools are watery without blood or mucus. The abdominal pain is mild and unrelated to her stools. She has had recent episodes of flushing. She has not had fever. There is no history of travel. She does not smake ar drink alcohol. Her past surgical history includes a fracture repair of her right leg 3 years ago. Her temperature is 368 6C (97 BF), blood pressure is 106/68 mm Hg, pulse is 103/min, and respirations are 20/min. Oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical examination shows facial flushing, a prominent jugular venous pulse and expiratory wheezes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Diverticulitis",
      "B. Infectious gastroenteritis",
      "C. Inflammatory bowel disease",
      "D. Carcinoid syndrome",
      "E. Irritable bowel syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Carcinoid syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that are exhibited by patients with carcinoid tumors. Such carcinaid tumars may occur in the small intestine, calan, branchial tubes, ar appendix. These tumars secrete excessive amounts of the hormone serotonin, as well as other chemicals that cause the blood vessels to dilate. Patients typically manifest with the classic triad of flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing (as in this case). Episodic flushing is the clinical hallmark of carcinoid syndrome: it occurs in approximately 85% of patients. Severe flushing is associated with hypatension and tachycardia. Up to 80% af patients develop secretory diarrhea (often with abdominal cramps), which is sometimes a very debilitating symptom. Flushing episodes are also cammonly associated with wheezing and dyspnea in up to 25% of patients. Additional symptoms include intermittent abdominal pain, heart palpitations, and hypotension.\nSurgery with complete remaval of the tumor tissue is usually the first-line treatment. It can result in a permanent cure if it is possible to remove the tumar entirely. The mainstay of treatment for advanced carcinoid tumars that cannat be removed surgically is octreotide injection. In many cases, this anti-hormone drug inhibits and sometimes reverses the growth of the tumars. Pathognomanic plague-like deposits of fibrous tissue occur most commanly an the endocardium on the right side of the heart.\n(Choices A and C) There is no history of blood or mucaus in the stoals or inflammatory signs; therefore, the diagnosis of diverticulosis and inflammatary bowel disease are very unlikely. Again, episodic flushing is quite characteristic for carcinoid syndrome.\n(Choice B) There is nothing in this vignette that suggests an infectious etiology or assaciatian.\n(Choice E) Irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. Furthermore, this patient certainly does not have the classic histary of irritable bowel syndrome.\nEducational Objective:\nThe classic triad of carcinoid syndrome includes flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing.\n93% of people answered this question carrectly;                                      Last updated: [7/9/2008]\nCopyright ®@ USMLEWORLD LLC.

    "question": "A 42-year-old male presents with a 2-year history of heartburn. The heartburn occurs after heavy meals and while supine. Over time, his symptoms have been increasing in seventy and frequency. His symptoms used to be alleviated with the use of over-the-counter antacids, but these have become ineffective in the past two manths. He also complains of epigric pain and occasional vomiting, both of recent onset, especially in the marning. He denies dysphagia or odynophagia. He eats junk food and drinks twa cups of coffee daily. He regularly drinks grape brandy and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes/day. Abdominal examination shows epigric tenderness. Abdominal ultrasound is unremarkable.

      "D. Manometric studies",
      "E. Reassurance"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's 2-year history of heartburn is very suggestive of reflux esophagitis; however, the recent onset of new symptoms also suggests another problem, such as Barrett's esophagus, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, ar even a tumar. Of the listed studies, endoscopy can provide the most information in the wark-up of any of these diagnoses.\n(Choice A) The generally recommended initial treatment for patients with uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux disease is a trial of proton pump inhibitor therapy. HZ receptor antagonists are no longer recommended as the first line of therapy for grade 2 or worse esophagitis. Patients should be advised about anti-reflux measures (e g., stopping smaking, weight loss, elevating the head of the bed, small meals, and modifying the eating habits).\n(Choice C) Provided that the patient does not have dysphagia, endoscopy can be performed withaut a preceding contrast study.\n(Choice D) If endoscopy is negative, manometry may be indicated.\nEducational Objective:\nRecognize when to order upper endoscopy in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

      "E. Adenocarcinoma of esophagus"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Esophageal cancer is the ninth most common malignancy on a worldwide basis. The two major histological types are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. In the past two decades, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus has been increasing in the western world. Today, there are equal numbers af cases of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The risk factars far adenocarcinoma include Barrett's esophagus, obesity, high dietary calorie and fat intake smoking, medications that promote GERD, etc. On the other hand, the major risk factors for squamous cell cancer of the esophagus are smoking, alcohal, dietary deficiency of beta-carotene vitamin B-1, zinc, selenium, environmental viral infections, toxin producing fungi, hot food and beverages, pickled vegetables and food rich in N-nitroso compounds, etc.\nIn this case, the patient has symptomatic GERD due to a hiatal hernia. Chronic GERD can lead to metaplastic changes in the lower end of the esophagus, thus replacing the normal squamous epithelium with columnar epithelium. This is called Barrett's esophagus, which as mentioned above is a risk factor for developing adenocarcinoma af the esophagus. Patients with Barett's esophagus have a 1% per year chance of developing subsequent esophageal adenocarcinoma.\nEducational Objective:\nChronic GERD and Barrett's esophagus are risk factors for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Patients with Barrett's esophagus have a 1% per year risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. On the ather hand, the major risk factors for squamous cell cancer of the esophagus are smaking and alcohal.\n78% of people answered this question correctly,                                     Last updated.

His vital signs are within normal limits. Fhysical examination shows na abnormalities. YWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Schedule colonoscopy",
      "B. Obtain CT scan of the abdomen",
      "C. Prescribe oral metronidazole",
      "D. Prescribe anather course of ciprofloxacin",
      "E. Prescribe oral ampicillin"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has the classic presentation of giardiasis. The causative arganism, Giardia lamblia, is common in areas where sanitary conditions are poor. The various modes of transmission are food-borne, water-borne ar person-to-person. The exact pathogenesis is unclear; however, the trophozoites adhere ta the mucosal surface by adhesive disks and produce malabsorption, which can sometimes be severe and may lead to weight loss. The most commaon symptoms are foul-smelling stools, fatty stools, bloating, flatulence, nausea, malaise, and abdominal cramps. These symptoms are usually of chronic duration. Stool microscopy far ova and parasites may be helpful for further evaluation. Empiric treatment should also be given with a course of metronidazole.\n(Choice A) Colonoscopy is helpful in patients with chronic, unexplained diarrhea.\n{Choice B) CT scan of the abdomen is not useful in the evaluation of this patient with giardiasis.\n(Choice D) This patient's symptoms were not relieved by taking ciprofloxacin. He is therefore unlikely to benefit from another course of the same drug.\n(Choice E) The treatment of chaice for giardiasis is metronidazole. In general, however, ciprofloxacin is the best antibiotic for infectious diarrhea. Itis unlikely that ampicillin will cover any organisms that ciprofloxacin does nat, nevertheless, oral ampicillin is used to treat some cases of infectious diarrhea.\nEducational Objective:\nAny patient wha returns from a developing country and has symptoms suggestive of malabsarption should be considered for empirical treatment with metronidazole for giardiasis. Remember the pathophysiology (adhesive disks and malabsarption).\nYou may get a very similar scenario, but the patient went ta a different location (e.g., Rocky Mountains).

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The mast likely explanation far this patient's symptoms is stagnation in the afferent limb after having Billrath II gastrojejunostomy, thereby resulting in bacterial overgrowth. The clinical manifestations of bacterial avergrowth depend on the underlying cause and severity of the disease. Symptoms may be nonspecific and include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, dyspepsia, and weight loss. In severe and advanced cases, patients may present with tetany (hypocalcemia due to vitamin D deficiency), night blindness {due to vitamin A deficiency), neurapathy (due to vitamin B-12 deficiency), dermatitis, arthritis, and hepatic injury. Physical examination may reveal abdominal distention with identifiable succussion splash (due to palpable soft, fluid-filled loops of bowel). Macrocytic anemia (due to vitamin B-12 malabsorption) can be seen on laboratory examination.\n(Choices D and E) The patient's histary of abdominal surgery due to peptic ulcer disease makes bacterial overgrowth a more plausible diagnosis than Crohn's disease or ulcerative calitis.\n(Choice C) This patient's presenting symptomatology is not consistent with that of peptic ulcer disease.\n(Choice A) Short bowel syndrome is less likely since surgery far peptic ulcer disease usually does not result in the remaval of significant segments of the small intestine.\nEducational Objective:\nBacterial avergrowth is a malabsorption syndrome which can be associated with a histary of abdominal surgery.\n20% of people answered this question carrectly;                                     Last updated.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The mast common cause of this condition is a gastrin-producing pancreatic tumor. As a result of uncontrolled gastrin secretion, parietal cell hyperplasia develops and stomach acid production is significantly increased. Multiple duodenal ulcers are typical, and a jejunal ulcer is almost pathognomic for this condition.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The diagnasis of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis of the colon can usually be made clinically. Patients with this condition generally have a history of constipation and little fiber in their diet. Symptoms may include left lower quadrant pain and fever. The best treatment includes IV antibiotics until the symptoms resalve. When patients fail to respond to antibiotics, a complication must be suspected, such as farmation of an abscess, fistula, or frank perforation. The best diagnostic test to evaluate such complications is via CT scan. CT scan is relatively non-invasive and highly sensitive and specific far diverticulitis, especially when it is accompanied by a perforation ar abscess.\n(Choice A) The plain x-ray in a simple bout of diverticulitis does not yield much, since most plain x-rays are frequently narmal, however, when the diverticulitis causes a perforation of the calon, free air may be seen under the diaphragm on an upright x-ray.\n(Choice C) Colonoscopy can be disastrous in the presence of acutely inflamed bowel. The endoscope can perforate the fragile bowel and lead to massive contamination of the abdominal cavity with fecal material. Colonoscopy is generally delayed until the patient's inflammatary signs and symptoms have subsided.\n(Choice B) Even though sigmaidaoscapy and colonoscopy will mast likely yield abnormal and significant findings in patients with acute diverticulitis, these procedures are not recommended during the acute episode because the risk of perforating the calon is very high.\n{Choice E) Similarly, barium enema should nat be done during an acute episode of diverticulitis, as the risk of perforation is as high.\nEducational Objective:\nCT scan is the best test for diagnosing and evaluating the abdomen of patients during an acute episode of diverticulitis\n61% of people answered this question carrectly;                                    Last updated: [7/24/2009]\nCopyright @ USMLEWORLD LLC.

    "explanation": "The classic triad of carcinoid syndrome (as seen in this patient) includes flushing, valvular heart disease, and diarrhea. Carcinoid tumors with hepatic metastasis may be associated with this syndrome. These tumors secrete serotonin and various other products, which may cause the characteristic symptoms. Isolated tumors without metastasis do not produce carcinoid syndrome.\nElevated serotonin and its metabolites 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) are present in the blood and urine of mast patients with carcinoid syndrome. 5-hydroxytryptophan is degraded in the liver to functionally inactive 5-HIAA thereby explaining why this syndrome is comman in the setting of hepatic metastasis. The precursar of serotonin (5 hydroxytryptamine) is tryptophan, which is an amino acid that is also utilized in the synthesis of niacin. Patients with carcinoid syndrome are thus at risk of developing niacin deficiency, owing to the increased formation of serotonin from tryptophan. This consequent decrease in the supply of tryptophan may cause patients to develop the 3 D's of niacin deficiency: diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia (4th D can be death).\n{Choice A) Vitamin A deficiency is nat related to carcinoid syndrome.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The causes of dysphagia in this patient include crico-pharyngeal dysfunction (oropharyngeal dysphagia), achalasia, stricture, and tumor. Dysphagia for both solids and liquids suggests an underlying matility disorder; whereas, initial dysphagia for solids followed by dysphagia for liquids suggests organic causes. Upper esophageal disarders typically present as dysphagia above or at the level of the sternal natch; whereas, lower esophageal disorders present as substernal dysphagia. Standard assessment of the esophagus usually begins with a barium swallow.\n(Choice A) Subsequent endoscopy is dependent an the findings of the barium swallow (ig, the outline of the patient's current esophageal anatomy). If Zenker's diverticulum is found on esophagography, endascapy should be avoided.\n(Choice D) Video fluoroscopy is indicated in patients with suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia. Examples of good candidates are patients with neurologic problems (e.g., stroke), who usually complain of nasal regurgitation, choking with feeding, etc.\n(Choice E) 24-hour pH monitaring 1s used in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. It is non-diagnastic for patients with dysphagia.\nEducational Objective:\nBarium swallow is the initial test of choice for all patients with dysphagia.

      "F. Mesenteric ischemia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Medication side-effects and interactions are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Particularly in alder patients, those taking multiple medications, and in people developing symptoms shartly after medication changes, medication side-effects and interactions must be high in the differential of new problems. In this case, the patient has developed digoxin toxicity due to concurrent verapamil use. Verapamil decreases the renal clearance of digoxin.\nThe most common side effects of digoxin toxicity are gastrointestinal (i.e., anorexia, nausea, vomiting). Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia and accelerated junctional rhythms are relatively specific for digoxin intoxication.\n(Choice A) Gastric irritation is a well-described cause of anorexia. Comman causes of gastritis include alcohol, stress, and NSAIDs. This patient does nat have clear risk factors for gastritis stated. Moreover, his symptoms occurred shortly after starting verapamil.\n(Choice B) Pancreatitis presents with abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting. This patient's pain (i.e., occurring anly with deep palpation) and lack of nausea or vomiting is uncommon for pancreatitis. Additionally, he does not have any risk factors for developing pancreatitis.\n(Choice D) Occult carcinomas are a frequent cause of new-onset anorexia in older patients. This patient does not have other specific symptoms to suggest a certain cancer. Additionally, his symptoms seem to be temporally related to medication changes. Mevertheless, his primary care provider should make sure that he has received age-appropriate cancer screening with colonascopy with or without obtaining prostate-specific antigen levels.\n(Choice E) This patient does not give symptoms consistent with gastrointestinal bleeding such as hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.\n{Choice F) Mesenteric ischemia presents as severe abdominal pain out of proportion ta the clinical exam. This patient has at least one risk factor for mesenteric ischemia (atrial fibrillation), but does nat have a typical clinical presentation.\nEducational Objective:\nDigoxin is a medication with a narrow therapeutic window. Several drugs, including verapamil, increase digoxin concentrations and predispose to toxicity. The most common side effects of digoxin toxicity are gastrointestinal (i e., anorexia, nausea, vomiting).\n39% of people answered this question carrectly;                                     Last updated: [7/19/2008].\nCapyright @ USMLEWORLD LLC.

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Pharyngoesophageal (Zenker's) diverticulum develops immediately above the upper esophageal sphincter by herniating pasteriarly between the fibers of cricopharyngeal muscle. Upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction and esophageal dysmotility are believed to be the causes of the problem. Incoordination between upper esophageal sphincter contraction and pharyngeal contraction may result in herniation of the mucosa via a pulsion mechanism. Patients are usually older than 50 years of age and present with oropharyngeal dysphagia and neck mass. The neck mass may cause gurgling in the throat and may vary in size, depending on the food and fluid intake. Potential complications include tracheal compression, ulceration with bleeding, regurgitation, and pulmanary aspiration. Barium examination can help delineate the diverticulum. Surgical treatment includes excision, and frequently cricopharyngeal myotomy.\n(Choice B) Gastroesophageal reflux disease is frequently associated with Zenker's diverticulum; however, it is important ta stress that the former does nat cause the latter.\n(Choice C) External inflammation may cause traction diverticula (usually in the mid-esophageal zone), but this is uncommon.\n(Choice E) Metabolic abnormalities (e.qg., iran deficiency) may be associated with upper esophageal webs.\n(Choice D) Abnormal praliferation is responsible for neaplasia.\nEducational Objective:\nFharyngoesophageal (Zenker's] diverticulum develops immediately above the upper esophageal sphincter by herniating posteriorly between the fibers of cricopharyngeal muscle.

    "question": "A 52-year-old Caucasian male comes to you far a routine health check-up. You decide to do age-appropriate screening in this patient and order a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy is normal, except for a 1.5cm polyp in the left descending calon. A colonoscopic polypectamy is done and the biopsy results are pending. The patient is anxious ta know the expected biopsy results and the risk of cancer. Which of the following types of polyps is considered to be mast premalignant?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hamartomatous polyp",
      "B. Hyperplastic polyp",
      "C. Villous adenoma",
      "D. Tubulovillous adenoma",
      "E. Tubular adenoma"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A polyp is a grossly visible protrusion fram the flat mucosal surface of the intestine. Most palyps are benign. Faolyps can be classified as follows:\n1. Hyperplastic polyps: These are the mast comman nan-neoplastic palyps in the calan. These arise fram hyperplastic mucosal proliferation. Mo further wark-up is needed.\n2. Hamartomatous palyps: These include juvenile polyp (a non-malignant lesion, generally remaved due to the risk of bleeding) and Peutz Jeghers palyp (generally nan-malignant).\n3. Adenoma: This is the most cammon type of polyp found in the colon. Itis present in approximately 30-50 % of elderly people. These palyps are potentially premalignant, however, <1% af such polyps become malignant. Most polyps are asymptomatic; less than 5 % of patients have positive occult stool tests.\nThe probability of an adenomatous polyp progressing into cancer can be judged clinically by the lesion's gross appearance, histology, and size.\n1. Adenoma can be sessile ar stalked (pedunculated). Cancer is seen more commonly in sessile\n2. Fo adenoma is divided into tubular, tubulovillous, and the villous variety. Villous adenomas, which are most commanly sessile, are most likely (three times more likely than tubular adenoma far malignant transformation) to become malignant amang all three varieties. Second an the list is tubulovillous, followed by tubular adenoma with the least risk of malignant transformation. Therefare, as the villus component increases, the risk of malignancy increases.\n3. The likelihood of an adenomatous lesion containing invasive cancer also depends on the size of the polyp. The risk is negligible (<2%) with < 1.5 cm polyp, intermediate (2-10%]) with 1.5-2.5 cm size polyp, and substantial (10%) with polyps =2.5 cm in size.\nEducational Objective:\nMost colon cancers develop from polyps. The risk factars for a polyp progressing into malignancy are villous adenoma, sessile adenoma, and size =2.5 cm. Only adenomatous palyps are clearly premalignant, but <1% af such lesions progress to malignancy.

    "question": "A 47-year-old male comes ta the emergency department complaining of an intense burning pain in his abdomen. The pain started a couple of hours ago and is getting worse. He also has nausea and vomited twice. The vomitus is described as dark red-brown in calor. He drank \"quite a bit of alcohol’ last night. He has had several episodes of this type of pain before, and was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease five years ago. Several courses of H. pylori eradication therapy have been prescribed in the past, but the patient admits to being non-campliant. He admits to smoking and drinking heavily. His temperature is 36 8 C (98 2 F), blood pressure is 126/88 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% an room air. The physical examination is remarkable for marked epigric tenderness.

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The mare likely causes of this patient's symptoms (i.e. epigric pain and bloody vomitus after an alcohal binge) are a bleeding peptic ulcer and/or alcoholic gastritis. His past medical history of peptic ulcer disease (FUD]) and significant drinking histary also support these diagnoses. PUD is the mast cammaon cause of upper Gl bleeding, accounting for = 50% of cases. Nearly all patients with upper Gl tract bleeding should undergo upper Gl endoscopy, usually within 12 hours of admission.\n(Of the laboratory parameters listed, BUN is most likely to be elevated in a person with upper Gl bleeding. A BUM level = 40 in the presence of a normal serum creatinine level is very suggestive of an upper Gl bleed. The elevated blood urea level is due to the bacterial breakdown of hemoglobin in the Gl tract and the resulting absorption of urea. The other comman scenario where you can see elevated BUN without an increase in creatinine level is the administration of steroids. Patients with prerenal azatemia (dehydration) can also have elevated BUN with very mild elevation of creatinine levels.\n(Choice C) The prothrombin time is not typically elevated, unless the Gl bleeding is due to a coagulation abnormality; this can also be seen in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices.\n{Choice E) The creatinine level should not be elevated, unless the patient has lost so much blood as to put him in renal failure. Isolated elevation of creatinine without an increase in BUN levels is usually seen fallowing the administration of certain medications, which inhibit the secretion of creatinine from the renal tubular cells. Classic examples of such drugs are trimethoprim +/- sulphamethoxazole (for FCF pneumonia ar urinary tract infections), cimetidine, etc.\n(Choices A & D) The platelet and potassium levels are not generally elevated in upper Gl bleeding. In fact, the platelet count is decreased in patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and splenomegaly. The potassium level is decreased in most patients with vomiting.\nEducational Objective:\nThe BUM level is often elevated in patients with upper Gl bleeds because the bacterial breakdown of hemoglobin in the Gl tract results in the absorption of urea. A BUN level = 40 in the presence of a narmal serum creatinine level may indicate an upper Gl bleed.

Tropical sprue is a chranic diarrheal disease characterized by malabsorption of nutrients, especially vitamin B-12 and folic acid, thus leading to megaloblastic anemia. The etiology is currently still unknown, but is mast likely infectious. The disease is characterized by signs and symptoms of malabsarption, such as glossitis, cheilosis, protuberant abdomen, pallor, and pedal edema. Other associated symptoms include fatty diarrhea, cramps, gas, fatigue and progressive weight loss. Hyperactive bowel sounds and borborygmi are commonly found on examination. The diagnosis can be established with small intestinal mucosal biopsy, which typically shows blunting of villi and infiltration af chronic inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils.\n(Choices B and E) Careful stool and serologic testing may still be required to exclude infection with Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Isospora bell.\n(Choice A) Fatients with celiac disease may have a positive family history. Although the histologic findings in celiac disease are similar ta that of tropical sprue, a recent histary of travel to an endemic area favors the latter diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Bacterial overgrowth has been suggested in several reports of tropical sprue cases, however, the characteristic histological findings mentioned in the vignette make the diagnasis of tropical sprue mare likely\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect tropical sprue in patients with malabsorption, along with a histary of living in endemic areas far mare than one manth.

    "explanation": "This patient is immunocompromised secondary to her chemotherapy, and presents with an area of constant burning pain without any other physical examination abnormalities. Herpes zoster (shingles) is the mast likely diagnosis. Shingles develops when there is reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV, the virus that causes chickenpox) in a dorsal root ganglion where it has remained dormant since a previous chickenpox infection. Reactivation along the ganglion’s distribution causes pain and a vesicular rash in a dermatomal pattern. The elderly and the immunosuppressed (patients with HY or diabetes, patients receiving chematherapy, etc.) are at highest risk.\nFain is the most common symptom of shingles. The pain can develop several days before the classic shingles rash appears, ar the pain and rash may appear concurrently. The pain is typically intense, deep, and burning in quality. A small subset of people with shingles go on to develop a chronic pain syndrome called post-herpetic neuralgia. Treatments for acute shingles include analgesics and antiviral medications like acyclovir.\nEducational Objective:\nHerpes zoster (shingles) develops when there is reactivation of VZV.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient mast likely has aspiration pneumonia secondary to Zenker's diverticulum. His clinical features (i. e_, oropharyngeal dysphagia and neck mass) are very suggestive of the diagnosis. Zenker's diverticulum may occur when the esophageal muscles fail to relax properly, thereby leading to herniation of mucosa through the fibers of the cricapharyngeal muscle In this case, the pathophysiology involves retention of food material, regurgitation, subsequent aspiration and resulting pneumonia. Esophagography has been shawn to be superior in demanstrating the diverticulum and esophagus, and is therefore the confirmatory test of choice.\n(Choice E) Esophagography can demonstrate both diverticulum and esophagus better than CT.\n(Choice B) Esophagoscopy should be avoided due to the associated risk of perforation.\n(Choice D) Bronchoscopy is not needed, in light of the diverticulum. It could be considered far the collection of samples for cultures, for patients who are unresponsive to antibiotics, and for patients with chest x-ray findings of cavitation (suggestive of an abscess).\n(Choice A) Puncturing the neck mass would have been appropriate if it was an abscess.

The pain first started around the umbilicus, but then shifted ta the right lower abdominal area. He has had one episode of vomiting. Physical examination shows tenderness at McBurney's point. CT scan of the abdomen confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Which of the following explains the pathophysiology of the shifting of pain fram the peri-umbilical area to the right lower quadrant in acute appendicitis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Movement of inflammed appendix with bowel movements",

      "D. Referred pain",
      "E. Rupture of appendix with pus draining into right lower quadrant"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The chronology of abdominal pain in acute appendicitis is typically visceral, followed by somatic pain. In the initial stages of appendicitis, only the viscera are inflamed, thus explaining the initial visceral pain which is dull, poarly localized (peri-umbilical) and constant. Afferent visceral pain fibers from the appendix accompany the sympathetic nerves and enter the spinal cord at the level of the tenth thoracic segment, thereby leading to periumbilical pain. As the disease ensues, subsequent inflammation of the parietal peritoneum and skeletal muscles causes samatic pain, which is well localized (right lower quadrant) and more severe in intensity. All these events explain the \"shifting\" phenomenon of abdominal pain from the peri-umbilical to the right lower quadrant, which is the classic sign of acute appendicitis.\n(Choice D) Referred pain is a type of visceral pain which occurs when pain is felt in an area other than that of the inflamed part due to shared innervation. The initial peri-umbilical visceral pain of acute appendicitis is referred pain.\nEducational Objective:\nIn acute appendicitis, the initial peri-umbilical pain is referred pain and visceral in nature; however, pain shifts ta the right lower quadrant with involvement of the parietal peritoneum and becomes somatic in nature.\n54% of people answered this question carrectly;                                     Last updated: [7/21/2008]\nCopyright ® USMLEWORLD LLC: QBank ver. 2008 02"

    "question": "A 40-year-old female presents with a 12-month history of episodes of chest pain and dysphagia. The episodes last from a few seconds to a few minutes. She has not had weight loss, fevers ar chills. Chest-x ray, ECG and barium swallow shaw no abnormalities. Manometric studies show simultaneous high amplitude contractions with normal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Which af the following is the mast likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Zenker's diverticulum",
      "B. Diffuse esophageal spasm",
      "C. Achalasia",
      "D. Scleroderma",
      "E. Infectious esophagitis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Diffuse esophageal spasm manifests with chest pain and dysphagia. The etiology is unclear, although in many patients, it is associated with emational factors and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Manometric studies demaonstrate high amplitude peristaltic contractions. The lower esophageal sphincter usually has a normal relaxation response. Since the spasms accur in episodes, pasitive manometric findings may be intermittent, thus making diagnosis difficult. The esophagogram is frequently normal, although the classic corkscrew esophagus is seen occasionally. The treatment includes antispasmodics, dietary modulation and psychiatric counseling.\n(Choice A) Zenker's diverticulum is a disorder of the proximal esophagus, and is generally seen in females. The diverticulum may vary in size and is generally asymptomatic; however, the occasional patient may present with complaints of food sticking in the throat, halitosis and regurgitation. There is no pain associated with the diverticulum. The treatment is surgery.\n(Choice C) A patient with achalasia has a lower esophageal sphincter that does not relax (high tone). Histopathology reveals hypertrophied inner circular muscles with absent or degenerating neurons {ganglion cells) in myenteric plexuses. Manometry shows absent peristalsis. The cause is not known, but a similar condition in South America is caused by the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. An esophagogram typically reveals a dilated esophagus with a bird's beak narrowing of the distal esophagus.\n(Choice D) Scleroderma is a collagen vascular disarder which can present with loss of distal peristalsis of the esophagus. There is fibrosis and complete atrophy of the esophageal smooth muscle. The lower esophageal sphincter becomes incompetent (low tane) with time, leading to reflux esophagitis and a stricture. This condition is progressive and difficult to treat.\n(Choice E) Infectious esophagitis is mostly due to Candida, Herpes, or Cytomegalovirus. This generally occurs in immunocompromised individuals (e.g, those with AIDS, malignancy, diabetes) and may present with dysphagia, oral thrush or odynophagia. Endoscopy with washings, culture and biopsy may reveal the cause.\nEducational Objective:\nDiffuse esophageal spasm is usually seen in young females and can present with intermittent episodes of chest pain and dysphagia. Barium swallow may reveal a \"corkscrew\" esophagus. The treatment is supportive.\n*Extremely high yield question for the USMLE.

    "options": [
      "A. Whole blood transfusion",
      "B. Fresh frozen plasma infusion",
      "C. Cryoprecipitate infusion",
      "D. Pooled platelet transfusion",
      "E. Plasmapheresis",
      "F. Hemodialysis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described in this vignette has two related problems: an upper gastrointestinal bleed and a coagulopathy. Given his history of liver disease and the presence of ascites, his upper Gl bleed is most likely due to ruptured gastroesophageal varicies. This blood loss has led ta hypovolemia (as evidenced by hypotension and tachycardia), although he has not yet became severely anemic. His chronic liver disease is alsa manifesting as a coagulopathy. The liver is responsible for producing the majority of clotting factors. The coagulopathy of liver disease often manifests as prolongation of both PT and PTT, although FT is usually mare significantly affected.\n‘Variceal bleeding is often life-threatening and should be managed in an intensive care unit. Initial treatment far this patient should include valume repletion as well as carrection of his coagulopathy. Administration of fresh frozen plasma will achieve bath goals, as FFP contains all clotting factors and plasma proteins and pravides fluid volume.\nReplacement of intravascular volume takes precedence aver diagnostic tests and therapeutic procedures. Approximately 50% of patients with acute variceal bleeding will stop hemarrhaging without any specific measures to stop the bleeding. Specific modalities to stop variceal bleeding include vasoconstrictors (octreotide and vasopressin), endoscopic variceal ligation, and variceal sclerotherapy.\n{Choice A) Blood is collected from donors as whale blood, but then is separated into packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate. Only the necessary blood product(s) should be ordered, rather than whale blood.\n{Choice C) Cryoprecipitate is rich in factor Vl, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and Factor XII. Its use is typically restricted to patients with a deficiency of one of these factors. As fresh frozen plasma contains all clotting factars, it is preferred far reversing coagulopathy secondary to liver disease.\n(Choice D) The risk of spontaneous bleeding does not increase until the platelet count decreases below 10,000/ul. Even major invasive surgical procedures can be perfarmed in patients with platelet counts of 50,000/uL. This patient has a platelet count of 120 000/uL and does not require platelet transfusion.\n(Choice E) Flasmapheresis, the process of removing a patient's plasma and replacing it with an IV fluid solution, is indicated when a destructive substance (usually an autoantibody) is present in the patient's plasma. Plasmapheresis can be used to treat some causes of hemalytic anemia; however, this patient's anemia is due to hemorrhage and therefore plasmapheresis will nat be helpful.\n(Choice F) There are no indications far dialysis. Although this patient does have a moderately elevated BUM, he has a normal serum creatinine. Thus, his abnormal BUN is most likely due to volume depletion ar gastrointestinal bleeding rather than renal failure.\nEducational Objective:\nFresh frozen plasma contains all clotting factors and is the first line treatment for bleeding patients with a coagulopathy.\n83% of people answered this question carrectly;                                     Last updated: [2/21/2010].\nCopyright @ USMLEWORLD LLC.

    "question": "A 35-year-old gravida 2, para 1 female at 20 weeks of gestation presents to her obstetrician with complaints\naf intermittent pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. She states that the pain is calicky and\nespecially severe after eating fatty foods. The pain is also associated with a bloated feeling. Her pregnancy\nhas been uneventful until now and she has regularly kept all appointments. She has a histary of\nhyperlipidemia, which is managed with clofibrate. Her only other medication is a prenatal vitamin. An\nabdominal ultrasonogram is performed that shows multiple biliary stones. Which of the following statements\nabout gallstone disease is true?",
    "options": [
      "A. Most gallstones are composed of calcium bilirubinate",
      "B. Eighty percent of gallstones are radio-opagque",
      "C. Gallstone disease is more comman in overweight women",
      "D. Pregnancy is not a risk factor for gallstone development",
      "E. Gallstone disease is mare prevalent in Asia than the United States"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Gallstones are formed by the aggregation of bile constituents. The three major types of gallstones are cholesterol stones, pigment stones (chiefly composed of calcium bilirubinate), and mixed stones. The\ncholesterol and mixed stones together comprise 80% of all gallstones in the Western population.\nCholelithiasis is very common, with over 10% of men and 20% of women in the United States developing\ngallstones by the age of 65. Many af these individuals are asymptomatic and do not require treatment.\nMarmally, water-insoluble cholesterol is secreted in bile and then converted into soluble micelles by bile acids\nand lecithin. If the gallbladder is hypamaotile or there is an excess of chalesterol in comparisan to bile salts,\nthe cholesterol precipitates into insoluble crystals that eventually farm to make gallstones.\nThere are numerous risk factors for the formation of cholesterol gallstones, including: Caucasian race;\nobesity or rapid weight loss; female sex hormanes or usage of oral contraceptive pills; glucose intolerance;\nhypomatility of the gall bladder (which is associated with pregnancy, advanced age, fasting,\nhypertriglyceridemia, and prolonged total parenteral nutrition); malabsorption of bile acids as would occur\nsecandary to ileal disease or resection; and pharmacotherapy with clofibrate, octreotide, ar ceftriaxone.\nRisk factors for the formation of pigment gallstones include: chranic hemalysis (as would accur in individuals\nwith sickle cell anemia); chronic biliary tract infection or parasite infestation; and advanced age.\nProtective factors against the development of gallstones include a law-carbohydrate diet, physical activity,\nconsumption of caffeinated coffee, and aspirin or other NSAID usage.\nDiagnosis of cholelithiasis in all patients is best confirmed with ultrasound. Once diagnosed, the treatment of\nchoice for symptomatic cholelithiasis is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pregnant patients who experience\nrepeated attacks of biliary colic can undergo cholecystectomy, preferably during the second trimester. Those\npatients who prefer not to underga chalecystectomy may be given a hile salt such as ursodeaoxycholic acid to\ndissalve the cholesterol stones. The gallstones frequently recur once the treatment is stopped, however.\n(Choice A) A significant majority of gallstones are categorized as cholesterol or mixed. The\ncalcium-bilirubinate containing pigment stones are the least common of the three types in the United States.\n(Choice B) Cholesterol and mixed stones are radiolucent, which means that they are not readily visible by\nabdominal radiograph. Therefore this method of imaging is not used in the diagnosis of gallstone disease.\n{Choice D) The gallbladder hypomaotility and stasis associated with pregnancy lead to the farmation of biliary\nsludge, a precursor to gallstones.\n(Choice E) Gallstones are far more common in the United States and other Western countries than in Asia.\nWhen gallstones do accur in those of Asian heritage, they are mare likely to be the pigment type.\nEducational Objective:\nGallstones are common in the \"fat, female, fertile woman of forty\""

    "question": "A 42-year-old obese woman with a history of chronic alcoholism presents with complaints of fever and right\nupper quadrant abdominal pain that began shartly after she had dinner at a local steakhouse. The pain is\nsharp, rated 7/10 in severity, and radiates to her right scapula. She also complains of nausea and vomiting.\nHer medical records indicate she has a history of asymptomatic gallstones. On physical examination, there is\nright upper quadrant tenderness with deep inspiration. Laboratory results include:\nLiver studies:\nTotal bilirubin                                   1.2 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin                                 0.8 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase                          130 UL\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT)          58 U/L\nAlanine aminatransferase (SGFT)            65 U/L\nAmylase                                       125 U/L\nComplete blood count shows leukocytosis with mild left shift. Which of the following is the most likely\nmechanism for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Impaction of gallstone in cystic duct",
      "B. Infection of gallbladder",
      "C. Comman bile duct obstruction with stone",
      "D. Carcinoma of pancreatic head",
      "E. Alcohol toxicity"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation fits the classic criteria for acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis typically develops\nafter a large or fatty meal and is characterized by the sudden appearance of steady pain in the epigastrium ar\nright upper quadrant. The pain may radiate to the right scapula ar be accompanied by Murphy's sign, which is\nthe sharp arrest of inspiration with gallbladder palpation. Other classical findings include fever, vomiting, and\nleukocytosis. Tatal serum bilirubin may range from 1-4 mg/dL, and serum aminotransferases and alkaline\nphosphatase are often mildly elevated.\nAcute cholecystitis is secondary to gallstone formation in aver 90% of cases, mast cammonly arising when a\ngallstone impacts in the cystic duct. Ingestion af fatty foods then stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder\nagainst the abstructed cystic duct, causing severe colicky pain. The tissue behind the duct obstruction\nbecomes inflamed, typically as a result of bacterial overgrowth secondary to stasis. The subsequent\nischemic changes can cause gangrene and perforation, with generalized peritonitis or a well-circumscribed\nabscess the mare common outcomes. Other patential complications include chalangitis and chronic\ncholecystitis.\nTreatment far acute cholecystitis includes suppartive care (nothing by mouth, with intravenous administration\nof antibiotics, alimentation, and analgesics). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended shartly after\nhospitalization and should be performed immediately in cases of perforation or gangrene.\n(Choice B) Although infection of the gallbladder is present in 50-70% af acute chalecystitis cases, itis\ngenerally secondary to gallstone impaction in the cystic duct. Therefare, infection would not be the primary\nmechanism far this patient's symptoms.\n{Choices € and D) Cammoan bile duct obstruction with stone or carcinoma would normally cause\nobstructive jaundice characterized by severe icterus and very high alkaline phosphatase levels.\n(Choice E) Alcohol toxicity can cause acute pancreatitis but is not associated with acute cholecystitis.\nEducational Objective:\nSudden onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and leukocytosis are highly suggestive of\nacute cholecystitis."

      "E. Do nothing at this time"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has chranic hepatitis B. The twa drugs approved far chronic hepatitis B are interferan and\nlamivudine. Treatment with either of these drugs is indicated for patients with persistently elevated ALT levels\nwith detectable serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBY DMNA (Choice C).\nThe degree of elevation of serum ALT is important in deciding the treatment since it is ane of the most\nimportant predictors of response ta both interferon and lamivudine. Therefore treatment with alpha interferon\nar lamivudine is unlikely to be effective in patients with normal serum ALT. Serum ALT of mare than twa times\nthe upper limit predicts a favorable response to interferon or lamivudine. In general lamivudine has a\ncanvenient route of administration (oral) and has fewer side effects than interferon. Interferon treatment is\nparticularly nat successful in young children and immunocampromised patients.\n(Choices A and D) These are the modalities emplayed in the past exposure prophylaxis in susceptible\npeaple but not for delaying the progression of chronic disease.\n(Choice B) This is far primary prevention of people at risk.\n{Choice E) This patient is having chronic hepatitis with ALT more than two times the normal and with heavy\nviral load.

      "D. Estimation of hemoglobin with peripheral smear examination",
      "E. No further investigation is needed as the patient has rotor's syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has jaundice as he has elevated serum bilirubin (normal total bilirubin = 1mgfdl). The next step is\nto determine whether he has predominantly conjugated ar unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Conjugated\nhyperbilirubinemia is present when direct ar conjugated bilirubin constitutes =50% of total bilirubin.\nUnconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present when indirect ar unconjugated bilirubin constitutes =30% of the\ntotal bilirubin. Marmally direct ar conjugated bilirubin constitutes =10% of total bilirubin. Thus this patient has\npredominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\nPredominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in following conditions:\nA) Intrahepatic causes:\n1. Intrahepatic obstruction, which can accur in, conditions like viral ar autoimmune hepatitis, alcohalic hepatitis, drug reactions, third trimester of pregnancy or postoperative states.\n2. Congenital defects in biliary excretion, i.e. Dubin Johnson and Rator's syndrome.\nB) Extrahepatic biliary obstruction.\nThe next step in the evaluation of patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is to study the liver enzymes.\nFatients with dominant aminotransferase elevation usually have hepatocellular disease whereas patients with\ndominant elevation of alkaline phosphatase have predominant intra or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. In the\nsecond group of patients such as the patient in this question it is very important to rule out an extra hepatic\nobstruction with an ultrasonogram ar a CT scan of abdomen (Choice B) If these imaging techniques fail to\nshow an extra hepatic biliary dilatation then the next step wauld be ta ga for an ERCP ar PTC (Choices A\nand C).\n(Choice D) Estimation of hemoglobin and peripheral smear examination is impartant in evaluation of\npredominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, as hemalytic diseases can be the cause.\n(Choice E) Congenital diseases of impaired hepatic excretion of bilirubin like Dubin Johnson and Rotar's\nsyndrome can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia but will nat have an elevation of alkaline phosphatase.\nEducational Objective:\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia is mainly because of intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstruction or congenital\nimpaired hepatic excretion of bilirubin."

      "A. Decreased lipolysis",
      "B. Increased hepatic glycogen synthesis",
      "C. Insulin resistance",
      "D. Glucagon overproduction",
      "E. Increased glucocorticoid production"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient most likely has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which refers to a spectrum of liver damage\nranging fram steatosis, to steato-hepatitis, and advanced fibrosis in non-alcoholic patients. Obesity and type\n2 diabetes mellitus are frequently assaciated with this condition, with a prevalence as high as 74% in obese\nindividuals. The pathophysiology is not clearly understood; however, majarity believe that insulin resistance is the mast likely mechanism. Insulin resistance leads to increased fat accumulation in the hepatocytes by\nincreasing the rate of lipolysis and elevating the circulating insulin levels. Intrahepatic fatty acid oxidation\nthen leads to an increase in oxidative stress, thereby causing a local increase in the proinflammatory\ncytokines TNF-alpha, with consequent liver inflammation, fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis.\nAlcahal is not involved in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but the clinicopathological\npicture resembles that of alcoholic liver disease. Liver biopsy shows macrovesicular fat deposition with\ndisplacement of the nucleus to the periphery. Liver biopsy is the best diagnostic toal for canfirming\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease. [tis also useful in the follow-up evaluation and management of patients.\n(Choice B) Hepatic glycogen synthesis is mostly reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hepatic\nglycogen synthesis does not play a role in hepatic steatosis.\n(Choice D and E) Glucagon production can be increased in some patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus;\nhawever, it does nat play a role in hepatic fat accumulation. Patients with Cushing's syndrome may have a\nclinical picture similar to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can be seen; however, Cushing's\nsyndrome is unlikely in this patient since his obesity has been present since early adulthood.\nEducational Objective:\nInsulin resistance plays a central role in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by increasing\nthe rate of lipolysis and elevating the circulating insulin levels."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with persistent abdominal pain. He says that the\npain began more than 12 hours ago and is predominantly epigastric in location. He reports having vomited\nseveral times since the pain started. His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia treated with\nsimvastatin and hypertension treated with lisinopril. He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day and consumes\n4-6 cans of beer daily and several more on weekends. He does not use IV drugs. On physical examination,\nhis blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, heart rate is 110/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and temperature is\n37.8°C (100°F). Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness without guarding ar rebound. Chest\nx-ray shows a left-sided pleural effusion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

      "A. Acute cholecystitis",
      "B. Pneumonia",
      "C. Myocardial infarction",
      "DO. Mesenteric ischemia",
      "E. Intraabdominal abscess",
      "F. Acute pancreatitis",
      "G. Peptic ulcer perforation",
      "H. Pyelonephritis"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with acute alcoholic pancreatitis. Classic symptoms of pancreatitis include nausea,\nvomiting, and intense epigastric pain that radiates to the back. Low-grade fever is also common. The\ndiagnosis is made based on the patient's history, physical exam findings, and elevated serum amylase and\nlipase levels. Gallstones and alcohol abuse are the most common causes of acute pancreatitis in\nadults. Rarer causes include hypertriglyceridemia, anatomic abnormalities, infection, and medications.\nFaotential complications of acute pancreatitis include exudative left-sided pleural effusions when the amylase\nconcentration is high, abdominal compartment syndrome, intraabdominal hemorrhage, shack, diabetes,\npancreatic pseudocyst formation, and abdominal pseudoaneurysm.\n(Choice A) Acute cholecystitis typically presents as right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and\nleukocytosis. Episodes are usually preceded by periods of biliary colic and the pain classically radiates to the\nright shoulder. This patient's alcoholism is a strong risk factor for pancreatitis but does not strongly\npredispose to cholecystitis. Finally, a left-sided pleural effusion is not easily explained by cholecystitis.\n(Choice B) Pneumonia can cause low-grade fever and a unilateral pleural effusion (for example secondary to\nempyema or a parapneumonic effusion). However, it would be unlikely for a patient with pneumania to\npresent with epigastric pain rather than cough or shortness of breath. Additionally, this patient's chest x-ray\ndoes not show any alveolar infiltrates.\n(Choice C) A myocardial infarction may present with epigastric pain and nausea, but it would be unusual for\nthis pain to last more than a few hours, in contrast to the patient above, who has had pain for 12 hours.\n(Choice D) Mesenteric ischemia presents with severe abdominal pain out of proportion to findings an\nphysical exam. The pain is often periumbilical and may be accompanied by nausea and\nvomiting. Hematochezia or accult blood in the stoal is common.\n(Choice E) Intraabdominal abscesses often present subacutely with fever, plus ar minus accompanying\nnausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient above has a presentation that is more acute than would\nbe expected from an abdominal abscess.\n(Choice G) A perforated peptic ulcer will cause epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, and\nperitoneal signs on exam.\n{Choice H) Pyelanephritis classically causes flank pain, fever, leukocytosis, nausealvomiting, and\ncostovertebral angle tenderness.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute pancreatitis classically causes nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain that radiates to the back. The\npatient's clinical history, physical exam findings, serum lipase and amylase levels all help to make the\ndiagnosis. Alcohal abuse is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in men and gallstones are the\nmast comman cause in women."

    "question": "A B2-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of diffuse abdominal pain and is found\nto have a single liver mass (3 x § cm) on abdominal ultrasound. Review of systems is positive far an\ninvoluntary weight loss of 7 pounds and increased fatigability aver the last three months. His medical history\nis otherwise noncontributory.

    "options": [
      "A. Alpha-fetoprotein measurement",
      "B. Bone marrow biopsy",
      "C. Thyroid nuclear scan",
      "D. Prostate-specific antigen measurement",
      "E. Colonoscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has chronic diffuse abdominal pain, weight loss and fatigue in the setting of a solitary liver\nmass. The most likely diagnosis is an intraabdominal malignancy that has metastasized to the\nliver. Because of its rich perfusion and function as a filter of the blood, the liver is a common site for\nmetastatic disease. Metastatic disease of the liver is many times mare common than primary liver\nmalignancy. Primary tumaors of the gastrointestinal tract, lung and breast metastasize ta the liver most\ncommanly. Patients usually present with symptoms related to the primary malignancy, as liver metastases\nare generally asymptomatic. In this case, the patient's history of abdominal pain makes colonascaopy the\nmast appropriate next step in establishing the diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Alpha-fetoprotein measurement is used along with imaging studies in the diagnosis of\nhepatocellular carcinoma, which most commonly occurs in the setting of chranic liver disease.\n(Choice B) Bone marrow biopsy is useful in establishing a diagnosis of myelopraliferative ar\nlymphoproliferative disorders. It would be uncommon far these disorders to cause an isolated liver mass in\nan otherwise healthy-appearing patient.\n(Choice C) Thyroid nuclear scanning can be used to diagnose thyroid malignancies. Thyroid cancers\nusually appear as \"cold\" masses on such scans because they commonly do nat express the sodium/iodide\nsymporter and therefore fall ta take up radiolabeled iodine. Aggressive thyroid malignancies may metastasize\nta the lymph nodes, bone and lungs.\n(Choice D) Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement is used together with the digital rectal examination\nta screen for prastate cancer and prostatic hypertrophy. Prastate cancer is generally an indalent\nmalignancy. When it does metastasize, it tends to travel to the pelvic lymph nodes. Presenting symptoms, if\nany, may be related to prostate enlargement.\nEducational objective:\nAn isolated liver mass is much mare likely to be the result of metastatic disease than a primary malignancy of\nthe liver. Primary tumaors of the Gl tract, lung and breast are the most common diseases causing liver\nmetastases. Liver metastases are generally asymptomatic; patients tend to present instead with symptoms\nrelated to their primary malignancy."

      "D. Acute pancreatitis",
      "E. Factitious pain"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This woman is experiencing postcholecystectomy pain, which is usually due to one of three reasons:\nsphincter of Oddi dysfunction, a comman bile duct stone, ar functional pain. Because this woman has normal\nliver function tests and there is nao evidence of dilatation of her biliary tree, both sphincter of Oddi dysfunction\nand common bile duct stone can be ruled out. She is therefore most likely experiencing functional pain with\nno obvious arganic basis and should be treated symptamatically with analgesics and reassurance.\n(Choices B and C) If this patient had an abnormal alkaline phosphatase or dilatation of the biliary tree\nobserved on abdominal ultrasound, then the presence of either a comman bile duct stone or sphincter of\n{Oddi dysfunction would be far more likely. ERCP would then be indicated ta confirm and treat the condition,\neither through stone removal or sphincterotomy. Since testing revealed na evidence of abnarmalities,\nhowever, functional pain is the more likely diagnosis.\n(Choice D) Acute pancreatitis usually causes epigastric pain rather than right upper quadrant pain. In\naddition, symptoms are typically severe enough to cause disruption of vital signs (eg, tachycardia, tachypnea).\n(Choice E) Factitious pain accurs when the patient intentionally feigns illness because she enjoys the \"sick\nrole.\" This is a difficult to diagnose condition that usually requires same direct evidence of falsification or the\ndefinitive elimination of all organic causes. A psychiatric histary is typically present. In this scenario, however,\nthere is no evidence that the patient is experiencing factitious pain.\nEducational Objective:\nFast cholecystectomy pain most cammanly occurs due to one of three reasons: comman bile duct stone,\nsphincter of Oddi dysfunction, or functional causes."

Current recommendations state that all\npatients with chronic hepatitis C should receive vaccinations to Hepatitis A and B if not already\nimmune. Both vaccinations are safe for use during pregnancy.\n{Choice B) HCV-RMA is detectable in colostrum (early farm of breast milk); however, studies have shown\nthat breastfeeding does not increase the risk of transmission to the neanate. For this reason, bath the\nAmerican Callege of Obstetricians and Gynecalogists and the American Academy of Pediatrics suppart\nbreastfeeding by HCV-infected mothers.\n(Choice E) Perinatal transmission of HCV is a much less frequent cause of infection, and the overall\nincidence of vertical transmission is around 2-5 %. Factors which seem to increase the averall risk of vertical\ntransmission are HIV coinfection and a high HCY viral load. A caesarean section does nat seem to\nsignificantly decrease the risk of vertical transmission. Currently pregnant wamen with HCY are not advised\nto have cesarean sections, other than for the usual obstetric indications.\n(Choice A) Combined interferon-alfa and ribavirin is used for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis\nC and compensated liver disease. However these drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy. Ribavirin is\nparticularly highly teratogenic.\n(Choice C) There is some evidence that shows that sexual transmission of HCY may occur, but the\nincidence is extremely low. In monogamous, heterosexual partners, the risk is less than 0.1% annually. With\nsuch a low risk, both the United States Public Health Service and the National Institutes of Health have not\nrecommended barrier precautions between stable monogamous sexual partners.\nEducational Objective:\nThe overall incidence of vertical transmission of HCV is approximately 2-5%. All patients, including pregnant\npatients, with chranic hepatitis C should receive vaccinations against Hepatitis A and B if nat already immune.\n*Extremely important question for the USMLE step-2"

      "A. Acute alcoholic hepatitis",
      "B. Hepatitis secondary to oral contraceptive usage",
      "C. Hepatitis secondary to isoniazid usage",
      "D. Autoimmune hepatitis",
      "E. Tuberculous hepatitis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's liver function tests and liver biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of acute hepatitis\nand hepatocellular injury. The most likely cause of this woman's acute hepatitis is isoniazid, which is a\ncomponent of her anti-tuberculous therapy. Isoniazid can cause severe hepatitis and even fulminant liver\nfailure within the first two months of treatment. The pattern of hepatic injury can vary from patient to patient,\nbut the most common histological pattern resembles that seen in viral hepatitis. Mild elevations in the\naminotransferases may occur in 10-20% of patients taking isoniazid but tend to resolve without\nconsequences. However, if the serum ALT and AST increase to more than three times the upper limit of\nnormal, the medication should be discontinued immediately. This is because there is a significant risk\nof Isoniazig-inducea hepatic cell injury.\nDrugs and toxins typically cause hepatic injury, either through direct toxic effects or through idiosyncratic\nreactions. The direct toxic effects are dose-dependent and have short latent periods. Some examples of\ndirect toxins include carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, tetracycline, and substances found in the Amanita\nphalloides mushroom. [diosyncratic reactions are not dose-dependent and have variable latent periods. Some\nexamples of pharmacological agents that cause idiosyncratic reactions include isoniazid, chlorpromazine,\nhalothane, and antiretroviral therapy.\nDrug-induced liver disease can also be broadly categorized according to marphology: 1) cholestasis, which\nis caused by medications such as chlorpromazine, nitrofurantoin, erythromycin, and anabolic steroids; 2)\nfatty liver, which is caused by medications such as tetracycline, valproate, and anti-retrovirals; 3) hepatitis,\nwhich is caused by medications such as halothane, phenytoin, isoniazid, and alpha-methyldopa; 4) toxic ar\nfulminant liver failure, which is caused by medications such as carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen; and\n5) granulomatous, which is caused by medications such as allopurinol and phenylbutazone.\n(Choice A) The patient's laboratory profile is not suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis. Classically, the AST ALT\nratio is = 2 in alcoholic hepatitis. Moreover, the timeline correlation between the initiation of treatment for\ntuberculosis and the onset of her hepatic dysfunction mandates close scrutiny of her pharmacatherapy\nregimen.\n(Choice B) Oral contraceptives are unusual in that they can cause abnormalities in liver function tests\nwithout evidence of necrosis or fatty change. Since this patient's liver biopsy demanstrated necrosis, oral\ncontraceptives are not likely responsible for her hepatic dysfunction.\n(Choice D) Autoimmune hepatitis should be considered once all possible causes of drug-induced ar viral\nhepatitis have been ruled out. Positive antinuclear antibody (AMA) and/or positive smooth muscle antibody\nsuggest the diagnosis of classic (type 1) autoimmune hepatitis.\n{Choice E) Tuberculous hepatitis may develop in cases of miliary tuberculosis but would be characterized by\ngranulomas on liver biopsy. Moreover, since this patient had a sputum conversion, it is highly unlikely that she\nis now suffering from miliary tuberculosis.\nEducational Objective:\nIsoniazid causes idiosyncratic liver injury with histological features similar to those seen in patients with viral\nhepatitis."

    "question": "A 42-year-old, Latino-American, female comes to the physician's office with complaints of intolerance to fatty foods. On examination, her vitals are normal and she has mild right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. An ultrasonogram of the abdomen shows multiple gallstones and an intrahepatic ill-defined cyst with a thick wall. A CT of the abdomen is performed which shows a well-defined cyst with egg shell calcifications. The past medical history of the patient is insignificant. The patient has no recent or past travel, and has had two pet dogs at home for 10 years. She is not taking any drugs and had never had any surgery. What is the most likely etiology for the intrahepatic cyst in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Amebic liver abscess",
      "B. Pyogenic abscess",
      "C. Hydatid cyst",
      "D. Cysticercosis",
      "E. Simple hepatic cyst"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has a hydatid cyst in the liver. Hydatid disease is due to infection with Echinococcus granulosus. Humans contract the infection from the close and intimate contacts with dogs, which are the definitive host in the life cycle of E. granulosus. It can cause unilocular cystic lesion in any organs including liver, lung, muscle, and bones. Multiple lesions are associated with E. multilocularis infection.\nIn most of the patients hydatid cysts are asymptomatic and generally diagnosed on screening for some other problem. However, it may cause symptoms, usually due to compression on surrounding tissues. Imaging techniques can be used for diagnosis along with the serological test. 'Eggshell’ calcification of a hepatic cyst on CT scan is highly suggestive of hydatid cyst. Aspiration of the cyst is generally not indicated due to the risk of anaphylactic shock secondary to spilling of cyst contents. Treatment is generally surgical resection under the cover of albendazole.\n(Choice A) Amebic liver abscess will not have egg shell calcifications on CT scan and also the patient's history is more suggestive of a hydatid cyst.\n(Choice B) Pyogenic liver abscess is generally secondary to a surgery, a gastrointestinal infection or acute appendicitis. Patients generally present with extreme pain, fever, and leukocytosis.\n(Choice D) Cysticercosis is secondary to infection with tenia solium and generally results in cysts in the brain or in muscle.\n(Choice E) The causes of simple liver cysts are believed to be congenital in origin. The pathophysiology of simple hepatic cysts is related to fluid secretion by the epithelial lining. Patients with simple liver cysts that cause symptoms usually report dull right upper quadrant pain, abdominal bloating, or early satiety. However it will not show any calcification on CT scan."

    "question": "A 42-year-old Caucasian man with a history of chronic alcoholism is admitted to the hospital for acute pancreatitis. He is treated supportively with intravenous fluids and meperidine and is given nothing by mouth. Over a period of several days, his white blood cell count and serum amylase decrease. He is discharged home. Four weeks later, he presents to the emergency department complaining of a palpable mass in the epigastrium with pain radiating to his back. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.0C (98.6F), blood pressure of 117/84 mm Hg, pulse of 86/min, and respirations of 16/min. Laboratory evaluation reveals a marked increase in serum amylase to 308 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "A. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis",
      "B. Infected pancreatic necrosis",
      "C. Pancreatic ascites",
      "D. Pancreatic abscess",
      "E. Pancreatic pseudocyst"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The development of a palpable mass in the epigastrium four weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis is highly suggestive of pancreatic pseudocyst formation.\nAlthough pseudocysts are most often associated with chronic pancreatitis, they can also complicate acute pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, or pancreatic neoplasms. Pancreatic pseudocysts are not true cysts as they lack an epithelial lining and are actually walled by a thick fibrous capsule. The pseudocyst is comprised of inflammatory fluid (containing high levels of amylase, lipase, and enterokinase), tissue, and debris that accumulate within the pancreas or by extension along anatomic planes. When the amylase-rich fluid leaks into circulation, serum amylase becomes markedly elevated. Ultrasound is the preferred means of imaging pseudocysts.\nBecause the pseudocyst often resolves spontaneously, drainage should only be performed if it persists for greater than six weeks, is greater than 5 cm in diameter, or becomes secondarily infected. One particularly concerning complication occurs when the inflammatory process erodes into a blood vessel, which can result in severe hemorrhaging into the pseudocyst.\n(Choice A) Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is a severe, life-threatening illness characterized by retroperitoneal hemorrhage and pancreatic necrosis. Physical examination findings may include a bluish discoloration of the flanks (Grey Turner sign) or periumbilical region (Cullen sign) resulting from blood accumulation in abdominal fascial planes. However, this patient has normal vital signs and no evidence of hemorrhage associated with his abdominal mass.\n(Choice B) Infected pancreatic necrosis is the diffuse infection of necrotic pancreatic tissue, usually occurring 1-2 weeks after an episode of acute pancreatitis. Patients with this condition are gravely ill, with spiking fevers, leukocytosis, and in some cases, shock and organ failure. Surgical debridement is the treatment of choice.\n(Choice C) Pancreatic ascites results from rupture of the pancreatic duct or leakage of the pseudocyst into the peritoneal cavity. Abdominal distention and shifting dullness are typically observed. Significant pain is uncommon.\n(Choice D) Pancreatic abscess is a localized, ill-defined collection of pus from necrotic pancreatic tissue. It presents as a tender epigastric mass and is associated with persistent fever and leukocytosis. Mortality rate is low following drainage."

When the liver is unable to create sufficient amounts of clotting factors, the PT is prolonged.\nElevated levels of serum transaminases are indicative of hepatocyte damage because these intracellular enzymes leak from injured hepatocytes. A marked increase in the transaminases is indicative of active and ongoing tissue destruction. A progressive decrease in transaminase levels signals either recovery from liver injury or that very few hepatocytes are functional. Thus, the interpretation of transaminase levels should be made in light of other liver function tests.\nIn this patient's case, a rise in PT with a decrease in transaminase levels implies that very little functional tissue remains in the liver, which can happen rapidly in cases of fulminant hepatic failure.\n(Choice B) Superinfection with hepatitis D would normally lead to an increase in the transaminase levels due to additional hepatic tissue injury.\n(Choice C) Recovery from hepatitis B infection is heralded by decreased transaminase levels and a normal prothrombin time.\n(Choice D) Coexisting infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can only be confirmed with serological testing for HCV. While it is possible this high-risk patient has recently become infected with HCV, it is less likely given her declining transaminase levels.\n(Choice E) The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is established through liver biopsy or the combination of confirmatory imaging studies and elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels. While hepatocellular carcinoma is more likely to arise in patients with histories of HBV or HCV infection, it is improbable that cancer is the cause of this patient's recent laboratory findings."

    "question": "A 52-year-old Hispanic male presents to clinic complaining of fever and fatigue of insidious onset. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, degenerative disc disease, and an episode of acute pancreatitis two years ago. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day and has consumed 72-96 ounces of beer per day for the past thirty years. He denies any history of blood transfusions, tattoos, or high-risk sexual behaviors. He works as a construction foreman and is married. Physical examination reveals tender hepatomegaly with spider angiomata present on his upper torso. Liver biopsy demonstrates steatosis, polymorphonuclear cellular (PMN) infiltrates, and necrosis. Which of the following is true about alcoholic liver disease?",
    "options": [
      "A. Males are more susceptible than females to alcoholic liver disease",
      "B. Alcoholic fatty liver is an irreversible condition",
      "C. In alcoholic liver disease, AST/ALT is >= 2",
      "D. Fifty percent of alcoholics develop alcohol-related hepatitis",
      "E. Mallory bodies are highly specific for alcoholic hepatitis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The spectrum of alcoholic liver disease encompasses fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis.\nAlcoholic fatty liver is rarely diagnosed clinically. Most patients are asymptomatic, with a minority experiencing mild tender hepatomegaly. This condition can develop after a single large binging episode, and does not predict progression to hepatitis, fibrosis, or cirrhosis unless alcohol intake continues to be substantial.\nAlthough some patients may be asymptomatic, those with alcoholic hepatitis often present with modest fever, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and anorexia. Aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and bilirubin levels are typically elevated. Liver biopsy is confirmatory if the diagnosis cannot be made based on clinical evidence alone.\nClassically, alcoholic cirrhosis is characterized by an increased ratio of AST/ALT, elevated alkaline phosphatase, jaundice, and hematologic abnormalities in conjunction with the stigmata of chronic liver disease.\nBroadly speaking, the various forms of alcoholic liver disease are characterized by modest elevations in hepatic transaminases and GGT. Very common in alcoholics but rarely seen with other forms of liver disease, an AST:ALT >= 2 can therefore be used as an important diagnostic marker. It is thought that this transaminase imbalance occurs in alcoholics secondary to a hepatic deficiency of pyridoxal-6-phosphate (a cofactor for ALT enzymatic activity). The absolute values of serum AST and ALT are almost always less than 500 IU/L in alcoholic liver disease. If higher transaminase values are present, concurrent hepatic injury secondary to viral hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis, or acetaminophen usage should be suspected.\n(Choice A) Females are actually more susceptible than males to hepatic injury from alcohol ingestion. This is likely secondary to gender-related differences in the metabolism of alcohol. An alcohol intake of 60-80 mg/day in males and 20-40 mg/day in females is considered the threshold for developing severe alcoholic liver disease. Genetic predisposition also may play a role.\n(Choice B) Steatosis (fatty liver) associated with alcohol ingestion is a potentially reversible condition and will completely resolve with abstinence from alcohol.\n(Choice D) Fatty liver is present in 80-100% of binge or heavy drinkers. However, only 15-20% of alcoholics will develop alcoholic hepatitis, with 50% of those individuals going on to develop cirrhosis.\n(Choice E) The histological transition between fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis is subtle. Classically, however, the findings in alcoholic hepatitis include hepatic cell injury evidenced by the presence of ballooning degeneration, PMN cellular infiltration, fibrosis, and necrosis. Mallory bodies are often observed in severe cases, but are not specific for the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents to clinic with intermittent episodes of tremor, clumsy gait, and depression for the past three months. Her past medical history is insignificant, and she takes no medications. She admits to occasional alcohol use but denies smoking or illicit drug use. Physical examination is notable for rigidity and restriction of upward gaze. Laboratory studies reveal the following:\nLiver studies\nTotal bilirubin 2.3 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 130 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 325 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 258 U/L\nComplete blood count\nHemoglobin 13.8 g/L\nErythrocyte count 5.2 mil/mm3\nMCHC 35%\nMCV 80 fl\nPlatelets 196,000/mm3\nLeukocyte count 5,500/mm3\nHepatitis Panel\nHBsAg Negative\nAnti-HBsAg Negative\nAnti-HBcAg Negative\nAnti-HAV IgM Negative\nAnti-HAV IgG Negative\nAnti-HCV Negative\nAnti-nuclear antibodies Negative\nAnti-smooth muscle antibodies Negative\nAnti-mitochondrial antibodies Negative\nA liver biopsy reveals moderate inflammation, portal fibrosis, and hepatocyte necrosis. Macrovesicular steatosis, vacuolated hepatocellular nuclei, and Mallory bodies are also observed. Which of the following investigations would provide confirmation of the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. CT scan of brain",
      "B. Serum iron and ferritin levels",
      "C. Urinary alcohol screen",
      "D. Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels",
      "E. Serum ceruloplasmin levels and slit lamp examination of eyes"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disease of younger individuals that is characterized by abnormal copper deposition in tissues such as the liver, basal ganglia, and cornea. Children and adolescents tend to present with liver disease (ranging from asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations to fulminant hepatic failure), while young adults tend to demonstrate neuropsychiatric disease (ranging widely from tremor and rigidity to depression, paranoia, and catatonia).\nClassically, the diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by the presence of low serum ceruloplasmin (particularly <=20 mg/dL) in conjunction with increased urinary copper excretion or Kayser-Fleischer rings. Therefore, evaluation of this patient should include measurement of serum ceruloplasmin levels and slit lamp examination of the eyes to establish whether the Kayser-Fleischer rings are present.\n(Choice A) The neurologic symptoms of Wilson's disease are secondary to copper deposition in the basal ganglia. Therefore, a CT scan of the brain would provide little useful information in establishing the diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Serum iron and ferritin levels are of benefit in evaluating a patient for hemochromatosis. While hemochromatosis typically involves the liver, symptoms tend to develop after the age of 40 and the liver biopsy shows marked iron deposition. Moreover, the presence of such distinctive neuropsychiatric symptoms supports a diagnosis of Wilson's disease.\n(Choice C) The presence of Mallory hyaline on the liver biopsy in this patient is a finding suggestive of alcohol liver injury. However Wilson's disease is also associated with Mallory hyaline. In addition, alcoholic hepatitis is rarely seen in young individuals who drink alcohol only occasionally. Moreover, the presence of such distinctive neuropsychiatric symptoms supports a diagnosis of Wilson's disease.\n(Choice D) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is typically associated with emphysema and liver involvement at a young age. Liver biopsy will show hepatocytes containing granules that are PAS positive and diastase-resistant."

    "question": "A 58-year-old Russian lady, who is known to have chronic pancreatitis, comes into your office for increasing pain, during the past month. The pain is dull, boring, located in the mid epigastrium, and radiating to the back. She is not able to work because of it. The pain is relieved by hydrocodone. She is also taking pancreatic enzymes and insulin for her diabetes mellitus. She is not taking any other drugs or alcohol, at present. On examination, she is weak and distressed. Her vitals are normal and her laboratory report shows normal glucose, amylase, lipase, WBC count, hemoglobin, and liver function tests. A CT scan shows pancreatic calcifications with a stone impacted in the main pancreatic duct with marked ductal dilatation. What would be the most appropriate next intervention in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increase her dose of hydrocodone",
      "B. Perform a partial pancreatectomy",
      "C. Perform an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with removal of the stone and stent insertion",
      "D. Increase her dose of pancreatic enzymes",
      "E. Celiac plexus nerve block"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Chronic pancreatitis is a serious disease and often leads to severe disability. Surgical interventions in the case of chronic pancreatitis are indicated in case of chronic pseudocyst, debilitating pain or to treat other complications. This patient has severe debilitating pain affecting her work and daily life. She is an ideal candidate for ERCP and stone removal with stent insertion, which would relieve the pain in 80% of such patients(Choice C).\n(Choice A) Patient is already on hydrocodone and you have just found a treatable cause for her pain. Increasing the dose of hydrocodone would only give symptomatic relief and would not address the stone impaction.\n(Choice B) Partial or complete pancreatectomy is a last resort for severe and advanced cases and it has high rates of pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes.\n(Choice D) Pancreatic enzymes have a role in relieving pain in chronic pancreatitis; they work by inhibiting the food induced feedback loops of pancreatic enzymes secretion. Their efficacy is variable and in the case under discussion we should treat the underlying cause.\n(Choice E) Celiac plexus nerve block can be used to relieve pain in chronic pancreatitis patients with non-dilated ducts."

    "question": "A 41-year-old Asian Male presents to his primary care physician with a several day history of subjective fever, generalized pruritus, clay-colored stool, dark yellow urine, and peripheral edema. A review of his chart indicates he has lost 5 kg (11 lbs) in the past ten weeks. His medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis that was diagnosed four years ago. He reports having intermittent flare-ups with bloody diarrhea. He does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs but has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day since the age of 11. Physical examination reveals icteric sclerae. His liver margin is 4 centimeters below the costal margin at the right mid-clavicular line and the tip of his spleen is palpable. He has 2+ peripheral edema. Laboratory evaluation shows the following:\nLiver studies:\nAlbumin 2.0g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 4.4 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 1310 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 167 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 155 L/L\nComplete blood count:\nHemoglobin 12.5 g/L\nMCV 86 fl\nPlatelets 260,000/mm3\nLeukocyte count 8,100/mm3\nCoagulation studies\nProthrombin time 13 sec\nPartial thromboplastin time 29 sec\nHepatitis Panel\nHBsAg Negative\nAnti-HBsAg Negative\nAnti-HBcAg Negative\nAnti-HAV IgM Negative\nAnti-HAV IgG Negative\nAnti-HCV Negative\nAnti-nuclear antibodies Negative\nAnti-smooth muscle antibodies Negative\nAnti-mitochondrial antibodies Negative\nAn ultrasound of the abdomen shows minimal ascites and focal dilatations in the biliary tree. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography is performed, which demonstrates multiple dilatations of the biliary tree with a prominent stricture at the junction of the cystic duct and hepatic duct. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "B. Refer patient for liver transplantation",
      "C. Order biopsy of the prominent stricture",
      "D. Prescribe ursodeoxycholic acid",
      "E. Order abdominal CT scan"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's history is significant for ulcerative colitis and his laboratory workup is consistent with cholestatic liver disease. The presence of peripheral edema, minimal ascites, hypoproteinemia, and hepatosplenomegaly are characteristic of early cirrhosis of the liver. Cholestatic cirrhosis in the context of ulcerative colitis is highly suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). This patient's ultrasound and ERCP findings of multiple dilatations within the biliary tree also support a diagnosis of PSC.\nCholangiocarcinoma is a rare, often lethal malignancy that is a known complication of PSC, developing in 10-15% of all patients with the condition. Cholangiocarcinoma is especially common in smokers with concurrent ulcerative colitis (UC), as nearly 30% of all cholangiocarcinomas are diagnosed in patients suffering from both UC and PSC. One of the early manifestations of cholangiocarcinoma is severe stricturing within the biliary tree, which causes a cholangitis characterized by fever, jaundice, and leukocytosis. Because cholangiocarcinoma can occur in up to 20% of patients with a long history of PSC, any severe stricture of the biliary tree in a patient with PSC should be biopsied to rule out cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, it would be most appropriate to biopsy the prominent stricture identified with ERCP before proceeding.\n(Choice A) Prednisone and sulfasalazine are recommended treatments for ulcerative colitis flare-ups. However, this patient is not experiencing an acute flare-up of ulcerative colitis. His symptoms are instead suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis and, potentially, cholangiocarcinoma.\n(Choice B) Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic, progressive disease that may eventually necessitate liver transplantation. However, cholangiocarcinoma is a relative contraindication for liver transplantation because of concerns about recurrence of the malignancy. Therefore, cholangiocarcinoma must be ruled out before considering liver transplantation referral.\n(Choice D) Ursodeoxycholic acid can be used in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who have elevated hepatic enzymes. However its role in preventing the development of cirrhosis or cholangiocarcinoma or in delaying the need for liver transplant remains unclear.\n(Choice E) A CT scan of the abdomen can detect intrahepatic tumors or liver atrophy, and can also evaluate the level of biliary obstruction. However, CT is limited in its ability to identify the extent or resectability of cholangiocarcinoma."

    "question": "A 45-year-old male comes to the emergency room with the complaints of severe respiratory distress. His chest x-ray is consistent with bilateral hydrothorax. A thoracentesis is done and the pleural fluid analysis shows findings consistent with a cirrhotic hydrothorax. A therapeutic thoracentesis is performed, and he is started on spironolactone and furosemide. However, the hydrothorax recurs and patient's diuretic dose is increased to 120mg/day furosemide and 200mg/day spironolactone. A repeat therapeutic thoracocentesis is done but again it recurs after 3 days. What is the best intervention for this patient now?",
    "options": [
      "A. Do a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)",
      "B. Do pleurodesis",
      "C. Put an intercostal drainage",
      "D. Increase the dose of his diuretics",
      "E. Do repeated large volume thoracocentesis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has refractory hydrothorax as evident by recurrent hydrothorax even with maximal dose of diuretics. TIPS procedure is the treatment of choice for patients with refractory recurrent cirrhotic hydrothorax (Choice A). Studies have shown TIPS to be more effective than medical therapy and repeated large volume thoracocentesis (Choice E) in patients with cirrhotic hydrothorax. Some of the common indications for TIPS are:\n1. Refractory cirrhotic hydrothorax\n2. Refractory ascites (defined as diuretic resistant or diuretic refractory ascites)\n3. Recurrent variceal bleed not controlled by other minimal invasive means\n4. Patients waiting for liver transplantation and needing portocaval shunts\n(Choice B) Pleurodesis is a choice for refractory pleural effusions secondary to malignancy but not for a hydrothorax secondary to cirrhosis.\n(Choice C) An intercostal drainage is a choice for a hemothorax or pyothorax but not for a hydrothorax.\n(Choice D) The patient is already on the maximal doses of diuretic indicated for cirrhotic ascites or hydrothorax. Also, further increasing the dose makes the toxicity from diuretics more likely."

He is currently sexually active with two different women, but uses condoms almost all the time. He does not report any recent foreign travel or infectious contacts. Physical examination is essentially unremarkable apart from the fact that the patient appears thin and icteric. Palpation of the abdomen reveals no tenderness or masses. Laboratory studies yield the following results:\nCBC\nHb 10.0g/dL\nHt 30%\nMCV 80\nPlatelet count 180,000/cmm\nLeukocyte count 6,000/cmm\nSegmented neutrophils 70%\nBands 1%\nEosinophils 1%\nLymphocytes 20%\nMonocytes 8%\nSerum\nTotal bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin 5.0 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 380 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 18 U/L\nAbdominal CT scan reveals an irregular mass extending from the pancreas.

    "options": [
      "A. Chronic pancreatitis",
      "B. Alcohol",
      "C. Low fat diet",
      "D. Gallstones"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's symptoms (e.g., fatigue, painless jaundice) and abdominal CT findings (i.e., mass extending from the head of the pancreas) are highly suggestive of pancreatic cancer. This condition is rare before the age of 45 but its incidence rises sharply thereafter. The incidence is greater in males than females, and is also higher in blacks. The main symptoms are jaundice and weight loss, but keep in mind that the presentation tends to vary with the location of the tumor. Tumors in the body or tail of the pancreas usually present with pain and weight loss as the chief symptoms. Tumors in the head of the pancreas typically present with steatorrhea, weight loss, and jaundice. The recent onset of diabetes mellitus, a history of recent but unexplained thrombophlebitis, or previous attacks of pancreatitis are occasionally noted. Risk factors for the development of pancreatic cancer include: family history, chronic pancreatitis, smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a diet high in fat.\n(Choices B to E) Alcohol, low fat diets, gallstones, or exposure to vinyl chloride have not been proven as risk factors for pancreatic cancer."

    "question": "A 38-year-old Hispanic woman presents to clinic complaining of a three-month history of menometrorrhagia and intermittent lower abdominal pain. Prior to this, her menses were light and predictably occurred every 28 days. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen and pelvis is ordered, which demonstrates several submucosal leiomyomas in the uterus as well as multiple gallstones. She denies any history of intolerance to fatty food or biliary colic. Her medical history is significant for psoriasis and a fracture of her right tibia incurred in a motor vehicle accident ten years ago. She takes no medications at this time and has no known drug allergies. Vital signs include temperature of 37.0 C (98.6 F), blood pressure of 116/84 mm hg, pulse of 72/min, and respirations of 12/min. Her BMI is 26.4 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals no icterus or abdominal tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of her gallstones?",
    "options": [
      "A. Recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy",
      "B. Prescribe ursodeoxycholic acid",
      "C. Recommend open cholecystectomy",
      "D. Recommend no treatment at this time",
      "E. Recommend lithotripsy to fragment the gallstones"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's menometrorrhagia is secondary to leiomyomas (uterine fibroids), and she denies any history of biliary colic or intolerance of fatty foods. Therefore, her gallstones would be classified as asymptomatic. Studies indicate that only 20% of patients with asymptomatic gallstones will eventually develop symptoms within 15 years. In contrast, 70% of those patients with symptomatic gallstones and a history of biliary colic will experience symptom recurrence within two years.\nThis disparity in long-term outlook dictates decisions in management. Traditionally, cholecystectomy is recommended only for those patients who have symptomatic gallstones and who are otherwise good surgical candidates. Patients with symptomatic gallstones who are not good surgical candidates should be medically managed instead. Those patients with asymptomatic gallstones should not undergo prophylactic cholecystectomy, as the benefits do not outweigh the risks. The only exceptions to this rule would be patients who are at increased risk for developing gallbladder carcinoma or gallstone complications (eg, morbidly obese individuals undergoing gastric bypass surgery, individuals who have porcelain gallbladders).\n(Choice A) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure and is recommended for low-risk patients who have symptomatic gallstones or a propensity for gallstone complications (eg, acute cholecystitis, porcelain gallbladder).\n(Choice B) Ursodeoxycholic acid is a medical treatment used to dissolve gallstones in individuals who are symptomatic but are poor surgical candidates.\n(Choice C) Most patients prefer to avoid the open cholecystectomy, a procedure that cuts the rectus abdominis and results in longer hospital stays and convalescence. It can be used for low-risk patients who have symptomatic gallstones or a history of or likelihood for gallstone complications (eg, acute cholecystitis, porcelain gallbladder).\n(Choice E) Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is an alternative to surgery for high-risk patients with symptomatic, small gallstones."

      "D. Dubin-Johnson syndrome",
      "E. Liver steatosis secondary to oral contraceptive usage"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Individuals with the rare Dubin-Johnson syndrome have predominantly conjugated chronic hyperbilirubinemia that is not associated with hemolysis. This benign condition is more common in Sephardic Jews but is found in all races and both men and women.\nClinically, icterus is evident, though the physical examination is typically otherwise normal. Most patients are asymptomatic, with some complaining of nonspecific issues (eg, fatigue, abdominal pain, weakness). The icterus may be so mild as to only became evident in the context of a trigger such as illness, pregnancy, or oral contraceptive usage. Routine laboratory testing is unremarkable, including the complete blood count and liver function profile. Serum bilirubin levels usually range from 2-5 mg/dL but can also be normal or extremely elevated (20-25 mg/dL) Offering additional insight is evaluation of urinary coproporphyrin. Individuals with Dubin-Johnson syndrome have normal amounts of total urinary coproporphyrin, but will have over 80% coproporphyrin I (versus normal individuals, who have a similar majority of coproporphyrin III).\nGrossly, the liver is strikingly black. Histological features are normal, though a dense pigment composed of epinephrine metabolites within the lysosomes can be seen.\nFor the diagnosis of Dubin-Johnson syndrome to be made, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a direct bilirubin fraction of at least 50% and an otherwise normal liver function profile must be present. Confirmation can be obtained by evaluating the urinary coproporphyrin for unusually high levels of coproporphyrin I.\nBecause Dubin-Johnson is a benign condition, no treatment is required and the prognosis is excellent.\n(Choice A) Rotor syndrome is a benign condition in which there is a defect of hepatic storage of conjugated bilirubin, resulting in its leakage into the plasma. Chronic and mild hyperbilirubinemia of both the unconjugated and conjugated forms then develops, without any suggestion of hemolysis. Liver function tests are normal. Pigmented granules are not seen in the hepatocytes of individuals with Rotor syndrome.\n(Choice B) Gilbert's syndrome occurs in patients with no apparent liver disease who have mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia thought to be provoked by one of the classic triggers (eg, fasting, stress, illness).\n(Choice C) Crigler-Najjar syndrome is divided into types 1 and 2, with the former a severe form that often results in permanent neurologic impairment or death. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a very rare, autosomal recessive disease characterized by significant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Phototherapy or plasmapheresis are typically helpful in the short term with liver transplant the only curative option.\n(Choice E) Liver steatosis can occur with oral contraceptives, but would also be associated with abnormal hepatic enzymes and a history of long-term OCP usage. This patient was only using OCPs for two weeks before symptom onset."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Acute acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones (Choice A). It is most commonly seen in hospitalized patients in the following conditions:\n1. Extensive burns\n2. Severe trauma\n3. Prolonged TPN.\n4. Prolonged fasting\n5. Mechanical ventilation.\nInvolved pathophysiology is localized or generalized ischemia, biliary stasis, infection, or external compression of the cystic duct. It generally presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain with fever, leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests. It can lead to complications like gangrene, perforation, and emphysematous cholecystitis. The initial investigation of choice is an ultrasonogram, which shows signs of acute cholecystitis and no gallstones; however, CT scan and HIDA scans are more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis. It is important to have a high degree of suspicion in high-risk patients in order to correctly identify this problem.\n(Choice B) Patients with chronic cholecystitis will generally show a small fibrosed gall bladder on the ultrasonogram.\n(Choice C) Acute pancreatitis can occur secondary to burns but it will not cause right upper quadrant abdominal pain with this kind of ultrasonographic findings.\n(Choice D) This patient has localized inflammation in the gallbladder, which is responsible for the acute symptoms.\n(Choice E) Bile peritonitis is a grave condition, which will be characterized by severe abdominal pain with rigidity and the ultrasonogram will show free fluid in the abdomen."

    "options": [
      "A. Acute alcoholic hepatitis",
      "B. Acute hepatic failure",
      "C. Fulminant hepatic failure",
      "D. Cirrhosis of the liver"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's acute onset jaundice and marked aminotransferase elevation are suggestive of severe hepatocyte injury. His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are significantly prolonged, suggesting his liver is unable to synthesize clotting factors. Lastly, the presence of asterixis and the complaints of confusion and changes in sleep pattern are suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. This patient's presentation is therefore consistent with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure, which is defined as hepatic encephalopathy that develops within eight weeks of the onset of acute liver failure. Coagulopathy is always present. Subfulminant hepatic failure is characterized by similar findings that develop between eight weeks and six months after the onset of acute liver failure.\nFulminant hepatic failure from acetaminophen toxicity has the most favorable prognosis, with mortality rates below 50%. The mortality rate in fulminant hepatitis with severe encephalopathy, however, approaches 80%. Adverse prognostic factors in cases of acetaminophen toxicity include acidosis (pH < 7.3), INR >= 6.5, azotemia (serum creatinine >= 3.4 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia (>= 1.2 mmol/L), and an increased blood lactate level (>= 3.5 mmol/L).\nTreatment of acute hepatic failure focuses on correcting metabolic abnormalities such as coagulation defects, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, renal failure, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy. Acetylcysteine should be administered promptly in cases of acetaminophen toxicity and will improve cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. Mannitol can be used if cerebral edema is present. Emergency liver transplantation may prove necessary and is associated with a 5-year survival rate of 70%.\n(Choice A) Acute alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by acute onset right upper quadrant pain with fever and AST/ALT >= 2. An increase in the PT will not be observed unless liver failure from another cause is also present. The absolute values of serum AST and ALT are almost always less than 500 IU/L. Higher concentrations should raise the suspicion of concurrent liver injury from other sources (eg, drugs, ischemia).\n(Choice B) Acute hepatic failure is defined as the development of liver failure within eight weeks of hepatocellular injury onset. If hepatic encephalopathy is also seen (as in this patient), then the syndrome is described as fulminant hepatic failure.\n(Choice D) While this patient is a chronic alcoholic, there is no evidence of cirrhotic stigma on physical examination. Moreover, cirrhosis is associated with a slow and insidious onset.\n(Choice E) Wilson's disease can cause fulminant hepatitis, but neuropsychiatric symptoms (such as Parkinsonian-like tremor or depression) are seen instead of asterixis and grossly elevated aminotransferases. Moreover, this older patient has no findings on history or physical examination that are suggestive of Wilson's disease."

    "question": "A 51-year-old Asian male with a history of chronic liver disease secondary to hepatitis C infection presents complaining of abdominal distention. He also admits to intermittent low-grade fevers, weakness, and weight loss of 17.6 lbs (8 kg) over the past two months. He admits exposure to several tuberculosis patients when he was in INDIA. His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Physical examination reveals tender enlargement of the liver. Normal heart sounds are present and the chest is clear to auscultation and percussion. There is no evidence of jaundice or scleral icterus. A paracentesis demonstrates bloody fluid with no bacteria present on Gram stain. Laboratory evaluation includes an alkaline phosphatase of 180 IU/L and an alpha-fetoprotein of 550 ng/mL (normal is 0-15 ng/mL). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Cirrhosis of the liver",
      "B. Hepatocellular carcinoma",
      "C. Abdominal tuberculosis",
      "D. Metastatic carcinoma of the liver",
      "E. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation with chronic hepatitis C infection, hemorrhagic ascites, and an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level is strongly suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma.\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant neoplasm that arises from the parenchymal cells of the liver. Cirrhosis is present in 80% of cases. In Western countries and Japan, chronic hepatitis C infection and alcoholic cirrhosis are the major risk factors for the development of HCC. In Africa and much of Asia, however, hepatitis B infection plays a more prominent role in the development of HCC. Other known associations with HCC include hemochromatosis, aflatoxin exposure, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, and tyrosinemia.\nLaboratory evaluation of the patient with HCC typically demonstrates a sudden and sustained elevation of alkaline phosphatase and a marked elevation in alpha-fetoprotein (typically above 500 ng/mL). The abrupt appearance of ascites (which may be blood-tinged) suggests that the tumor is bleeding or has caused thrombosis of the portal or hepatic veins. Helical CT scanning and MRI with contrast are the preferred means of imaging HCC, with liver biopsy being diagnostic. Surgical resection may result in cure, though liver transplantation is preferable in some circumstances. In the United States, the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with HCC is only 5%.\n(Choice A) Patients with cirrhosis of the liver can develop ascites secondary to portal hypertension. The ascites is always non-bloody and has a SAAG >= 1.1.\n(Choice C) Tuberculosis can cause hemorrhagic ascites, but the ascitic fluid generally also contains acid-fast bacilli. Systemic symptoms like weight loss and low-grade fever are common. Alpha-fetoprotein levels are not elevated. Serum AFP levels greater than 500 mcg/L in a high-risk patient is diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n(Choice D) Metastatic carcinoma to the liver is the most common hepatic malignancy and is generally secondary to gastrointestinal cancer. It is much less likely in the context of chronic hepatitis C infection, however.\n(Choice E) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is thought to occur in 20-30% of patients with cirrhosis. The condition is characterized by fever and ascitic fluid that contains a single organism, PMN >= 250/L, and no blood."

He has not been seen by a physician for several years, but says that he was previously diagnosed with depression and peptic ulcer disease. He takes no medications. He is currently living alone and is unemployed. He admits to drinking 6-12 beers per night, depending on what he can afford. He has a remote history of cigarette smoking. Physical examination reveals bilateral gynecomastia and spider angiomas on his upper extremities. Caput medusae are noted on his abdomen. Percussion of the abdomen demonstrates shifting dullness. There is no evidence of asterixis. There is pitting edema of the lower extremities. Which of the following physical findings has the same pathogenesis as gynecomastia?",
    "options": [
      "A. Caput medusae",
      "B. Ascites",
      "C. Asterixis",
      "D. Spider angiomata",
      "E. Pedal edema"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has numerous cirrhotic stigmata that are suggestive of alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis of any type leads to progressive loss of liver functionality. Liver functions can be divided into three distinct categories: synthetic (synthesis of clotting factors, cholesterol, and proteins); metabolic (metabolism of drugs and steroids, including detoxification); and excretory (bile excretion).\nIn the cirrhotic patient, gynecomastia arises from hyperestrogenism secondary to the damaged liver's inability to metabolize circulating estrogens. Other manifestations of hyperestrogenism in the cirrhotic patient include palmar erythema, spider angiomas, and testicular atrophy and decreased body hair in males.\n(Choice A) Caput medusae arise from the dilatation of superficial veins on the anterior abdominal wall secondary to portal hypertension. Portal hypertension results from increased resistance to portal flow at the sinusoids and leads to increased pressure at the portosystemic collateral veins in the anterior abdomen, lower rectum, and the lower end of esophagus where the portal and systemic circulations meet. This phenomenon is responsible for the esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, and caput medusae commonly seen in cirrhotic patients.\n(Choice B) The pathogenesis of cirrhotic ascites is complex and includes sinusoidal hypertension, the seepage of hepatic lymph into the peritoneal cavity, leakage of intestinal fluid, and renal retention of sodium and water.\n(Choice C) Asterixis is a neurologic sign associated with poor hepatic function and hyperammonemia. In the healthy liver, ammonia is detoxified to urea, which is then excreted in the urine. Because the cirrhotic liver has lost this function, ammonia is allowed to accumulate in the blood. Impaired neuronal function and cerebral edema are associated with hyperammonemia.\n(Choice E) The liver is the primary site of protein synthesis, and the cirrhotic liver typically produces insufficient amounts of important proteins such as albumin. Hypoalbuminemia leads to a decrease in the intravascular oncotic pressure. Fluid then moves into the extravascular space, and pitting edema in the lower extremities (eg, pedal edema) results."

    "question": "A 42-year-old alcoholic Caucasian male presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe abdominal pain and several episodes of vomiting. His friend accompanies him and says that they were binge drinking last night while watching a football game on television. The patient rates his pain as 9/10 in severity and says that it radiates to his back. He has never experienced these symptoms before and has an otherwise unremarkable medical history. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F), blood pressure of 112/70 mm Hg, pulse of 102/min, and respirations of 16/min. Physical examination demonstrates epigastric tenderness to palpation but no rigidity. Bowel sounds are absent. There is no evidence of hematemesis and a guaiac smear is negative. Preliminary laboratory findings include a normal hemoglobin and leukocytosis. A chest radiograph and electrocardiogram are normal. Which of the following investigations should be ordered next to confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Abdominal ultrasound",
      "B. Serum amylase and lipase",
      "C. Serum troponin I",
      "D. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP)",
      "E. Abdominal CT scan"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has an acute abdomen. Given his recent binge drinking, severe epigastric pain radiating to his back, and leukocytosis, a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis would be most likely. Other medical and surgical causes of acute abdomen are lower on the differential based on the test results thus far. For instance, peptic ulcers and gastritis are typically associated with gastrointestinal bleeding; perforation of the stomach or bowel is usually signaled by the presence of free air under the diaphragm on chest radiograph; pneumonia is rarely present in patients with normal chest radiographs; and myocardial ischemia is usually identifiable by electrocardiogram.\nEvaluation of all cases of suspected pancreatitis should include measurement of the serum amylase and lipase levels. Early in the course of acute pancreatitis, there is a dysfunction in the synthesis-secretion relationship of pancreatic digestive enzymes in which synthesis continues despite a blockade in secretion. The result is a leakage of digestive enzymes from acinar cells into the interstitial space and, ultimately, the systemic circulation.\nSerum amylase is the most commonly ordered test in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. It rises within 6-12 hours of symptom onset and may remain elevated for 3-5 days, with values often three times the upper limit of normal. Serum lipase has a sensitivity of 85-100% and is more specific than serum amylase. Both tests are considered nonspecific overall, however, because hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia are associated with a variety of nonpancreatic diseases.\n(Choice A) The classic ultrasound finding in a patient with pancreatitis is a diffusely enlarged, hypoechoic pancreas. Because bowel gas obscures the pancreas in 25-35% of patients, however, ultrasound is not considered a reliable means for identifying pancreatitis. It is primarily used in diagnosing gallbladder disease instead.\n(Choice C) Serum troponin I is a preferred marker for the diagnosis of myocardial injury as it is more specific than other cardiac enzymes (eg, creatinine kinase). However, since the electrocardiogram findings and patient presentation are not consistent with myocardial infarction, the testing of cardiac enzymes is likely to be of less diagnostic value at this point.\n(Choice D) Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) is an excellent diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the evaluation of chronic pancreatitis or common bile duct pathology.\n(Choice E) Abdominal CT scan is the most valuable imaging test in the identification of the presence, severity, and complications of pancreatitis. Those patients with clinical and biochemical findings suggestive of pancreatitis who fail to improve with conservative treatment should undergo abdominal CT scan to search for areas of infection or necrosis. Since this patient has just presented and has not yet been fully worked up with serum amylase and lipase levels, however, an abdominal CT scan would be premature."

    "question": "A 85-year-old homeless Caucasian male with a history of hepatic cirrhosis is brought to the emergency department in a semicomatose state. A friend accompanies him and says that the patient \"got dehydrated from being out in the sun all day yesterday and today.\" The patient has had two episodes of hematemesis in the past and is currently on propanolol. He has been an alcoholic for the past thirty years and typically drinks one bottle of wine per day. Physical examination reveals decerebrate posturing, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, and free fluid in the abdomen. His mucous membranes are dry and his exhalations have a sweet, musty smell. Laboratory evaluation includes the following:\nProthrombin time 18 sec\nPartial thromboplastin time 43 sec\nTotal proteins, serum 4.8 g/dL\nAmmonia, plasma 104 pmol/L (normal 21-50 pmol/L)\nIntravenous fluids are started to correct the patient's dehydration. What additional treatment is most appropriate?",
    "options": [
      "A. Protein and glucose-free diet",
      "B. Branched-chain amino acids",
      "C. Lactulose",
      "D. Liver transplantation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a reversible decline in neurologic function that is precipitated by hepatic damage. The pathogenesis of this condition is likely related to increased levels of ammonia in circulation, which causes inhibitory neurotransmission via the GABA receptors in the central nervous system. The initial management of hepatic encephalopathy should be based on two principles: correction of any precipitating factors and the lowering of blood ammonia concentration. Common precipitating factors include hypovolemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypoxia, sedative usage, hypoglycemia, infection, and rarely hepatic vascular occlusion. Lowering of the blood ammonia level is accomplished with continuous administration of a disaccharide such as lactulose or lactitol. Bacterial action on the lactulose results in acidification of colonic contents, which converts the absorbable ammonia into nonabsorbable ammonium ion (an ammonia trap). The majority of patients will respond to the disaccharides, but those who do not can be placed on ornithine-aspartate infusion or oral sodium benzoate. A further alternative for disaccharide non-responders is the addition of neomycin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic that destroys ammonia-producing colonic bacteria, to the regimen. However, neomycin long-term use is limited by its ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Protein intake can be reduced but should not be significantly limited, as a drastic reduction could lead to a negative nitrogen balance\n(Choice A) Protein-free diets are not appropriate in patients with hepatic encephalopathy because of concerns about the development of a negative nitrogen balance. Protein intake can be limited to less than 70 g/day, however. Implementing a glucose-free diet is also inadvisable, as patients actually require high-glucose diets.\n(Choice B) Branched-chain amino acids should be added to a low-protein diet in patients who appear severely intolerant to protein. When given alone, however, these amino acids are insufficient in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.\n(Choice C) Liver transplantation may prove eventually necessary to correct this patient's underlying hepatic disease. However, transplantation is always a time-consuming process and therefore would be entirely inappropriate for the immediate management of acute hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that has a high mortality rate when untreated.\n(Choice E) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) allows for the creation of a low-resistance channel that bridges the hepatic vein and the intrahepatic segment of the portal vein. This procedure is used to treat the consequences of portal hypertension (namely, variceal hemorrhage and ascites), not hepatic encephalopathy. Infact, one of the known complications of the TIPS procedure is a portosystemic encephalopathy that occurs in 30% of all patients."

    "question": "A 59-year-old Caucasian male presents to his primary care physician complaining of chronic fatigue of insidious onset that is limiting his ability to function as a business executive. He considers himself to normally be \"in excellent health \" which he attributes to his well-balanced diet and a strict exercise regimen that he recently had to curtail. He is very disturbed by this change in stamina and asks for a thorough medical examination. His past medical history is insignificant except for a motor vehicle accident in 1982 that resulted in a laceration of his spleen. The resultant heavy bleeding required that he be given four units of blood products. The patient lives with his wife and two college-age children. He denies any history of sexual contact with partners outside of his marriage. An extensive work-up for his fatigue is undertaken and he is diagnosed with anemia secondary to diverticular disease. An appropriate treatment plan is developed to address these conditions. Which of the following screening tests should also be performed at this time?",
    "options": [
      "A. HIV infection screening",
      "B. Hepatitis B and C screening",
      "C. Hepatitis C screening",
      "D. Hepatitis B screening",
      "E. Hepatitis A screening"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus all have the potential to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Due to thorough screening of donor blood today, however, blood transfusions are no longer considered a significant risk factor for contracting HIV or hepatitis B or C. As of 2002, the estimated risk of infection per unit of blood was <= 1:540,000 for HCV, approximately 1:140,000 for HBV, and approximately 1:1,900,000 for HIV. The screening of blood for anti-HBcAg was introduced in 1986 and the more sensitive immune assays for hepatitis C were introduced in 1992. Therefore, all patients who received blood transfusions before these dates should be screened for hepatitis B and C.\n(Choice A) HIV screening is less important in this patient because HIV was a very unusual disease in 1982. Even if HIV had been present in the transfused units, its infectivity would be significantly less than that of HBV or HCV. Moreover, this patient reports no symptoms over the past twenty years that might suggest HIV infection.\n(Choice C) In general, individuals who should be screened for hepatitis C virus include: 1) IV drug abusers; 2) persons receiving blood transfusions or organ transplants before July 1992; 3) hemodialysis patients: 4) persons with chronically elevated ALT values; 5) children born to HCV-positive mothers; 6) health care workers who have suffered needle stick injury or mucosal exposure to HCV-positive blood: and 7) persons who received blood transfusions from an individual who later seroconverted to HCV-positive.\n(Choice D) In general, individuals who should be screened for hepatitis B virus include: 1) individuals born in hyperendemic areas (Africa, Southeast Asia, Middle East, Pacific islands, Amazon River basin, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic), 2) men who have sex with men; 3) IV drug abusers; 4) dialysis patients; 5) HIV-positive individuals; 6) pregnant women; and 7) contacts (family, household, or sexual) of HBV-infected individuals.\n(Choice E) Hepatitis A can be transmitted by infected blood (although the fecal-oral route is more common). However, HAV would have caused symptoms at the time of transmission, as it does not have a chronic stage."

      "D. IV fluid bolus",
      "E. IV loop diuretic",
      "F. Abdominal ultrasound",
      "G. Urine culture",
      "H. Renal angiography"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), given his acute oliguria (<=250 cc urine in 12 hours), azotemia (rise in BUN), and increased serum creatinine. ARF may be pre-renal, post-renal, or intrinsic renal in etiology. Post-operative urinary retention is common after lower abdominal and/or pelvic surgery in males over age 50, due in part to the frequency of BPH in this population, and is likely the post-renal cause of ARF here. Bladder distention from such an obstruction would explain this patient's new abdominal pain. For distal obstructions, foley catheterization (Choice B) can restore normal urine output, and is essential for the resolution/prevention of hydronephrosis, tubular atrophy, and renal injury. If catheterization does not relieve the patient's oliguria, then alternative ARF etiologies (i.e. intrinsic, pre-renal) must be considered. Pre-renal causes of ARF include volume depletion, decreased cardiac output, and systemic vasodilation; patients present with BUN/Cr ratios >=20. Intrinsic causes include damage to the renal vasculature, glomeruli, tubules, or interstitium.\n(Choices A & G) Urine sediment analysis is helpful in differentiating pre-renal and intrinsic renal failure. In acute tubular necrosis (ATN), muddy brown casts are present. Urine eosinophils suggest acute interstitial nephritis. Pyelonephritis, as suggested by a positive urine culture, would be unlikely to cause renal failure unless complicated by hypotension leading to ATN.\n(Choice C) Urgent hemodialysis is indicated for severe acidemia, hyperkalemia, volume overload, or uremic encephalopathy.\n(Choice D) IV fluids are critical in the treatment of pre-renal ARF caused by hypovolemia. In post-renal obstruction, however, administration of IV fluids without first placing a catheter would exacerbate strain on the kidneys.\n(Choice E) In an adequately hydrated patient with recent-onset oliguria due to pre-renal or certain intrinsic renal causes, an IV loop diuretic may be appropriate to avoid volume overload.\n(Choice F) If a normal urine output is not restored by foley catheterization, then obstruction at or proximal to the bladder (e.g. bilateral ureteral obstruction) must be ruled out. Such conditions can be diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound.\n(Choice H) Renal angiography can help diagnose renovascular causes of ARF like renal vein thrombosis or renal artery occlusion."

    "question": "A 22-year-old Caucasian male college student presents to his primary care physician complaining of a two-day history of right upper abdominal pain and \"not feeling well.\" He also admits to having unusually dark urine, feeling fatigued and anorexic, and developing a sudden aversion to cigarette smoking. He returned from a trip to Mexico with his family approximately three weeks ago. His sister has similar complaints but has not yet sought medical treatment. Physical examination reveals yellow sclera, right upper quadrant tenderness, and hepatomegaly. Total bilirubin is measured at 6.0 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of hepatitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hepatitis D",
      "B. Hepatitis B",
      "C. Hepatitis C",
      "D. Hepatitis A",
      "E. Infectious mononucleosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The clinical picture of viral hepatitis can be divided into three phases: the prodromal phase, the icteric phase, and the convalescent phase. Given this patient's jaundice and worsening prodromal symptoms, he is considered to be in the icteric phase of acute hepatitis. Infection with the hepatitis A virus is strongly suggested by his recent travel to an endemic country and his sister's similar clinical complaints.\nThe pathogen responsible for hepatitis A is an RNA picornavirus with an average incubation period of 30 days. Transmission occurs through the fecal-oral route and is common in areas with overcrowding and poor sanitation. Outbreaks frequently result from contaminated water or food. Onset is acute, and symptoms can include malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mild abdominal pain, and an aversion to smoking. Hepatomegaly is commonly seen. AST and ALT spike early in the illness, followed by increases in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Fortunately, hepatitis A infection is a self-limiting disease and does not progress to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. The mortality rate is less than 0.2%, although a significantly prolonged prothrombin time correlates with increased mortality.\nTreatment of hepatitis A infection is largely supportive, with complete recovery expected in 3-6 weeks. Close contacts of individuals with hepatitis A should promptly be given immune globulin. People considered at high risk (eg, those living in or traveling to endemic areas, those with chronic liver disease or clotting-factor disorders, men who have sex with men) should be given the hepatitis A vaccine as prophylaxis.\n(Choice B) Hepatitis B is a DNA virus with an incubation period of 30-180 days. Onset is typically insidious, and transmission can occur sexually, parenterally, or vertically. Chronic hepatitis develops in 1-2% of immunocompetent adults and 80% of newborns. These chronic carriers of HBV are at significant risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recombinant vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin are the available preventative measures.\n(Choice C) Hepatitis C is an RNA virus with an average incubation period of 40-50 days. Clinical illness is mild and patients are often asymptomatic. Infection with hepatitis C virus primarily occurs parenterally, but sexual and vertical transmission are also possible. Chronic hepatitis develops in >80% of patients, who are then at increased risk of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. No vaccine or immunoglobulins are available, though treatment with interferon and ribavirin usually slows disease progression. Clinically significant acute hepatitis from hepatitis C infection is very rare.\n(Choice A) Hepatitis D is an incomplete RNA virus that causes hepatitis only in association with hepatitis B infection. It is transmitted by percutaneous, sexual, and perinatal routes. Superinfection with HDV in a patient with chronic hepatitis B can result in fulminant hepatitis or severe chronic hepatitis that quickly progresses to cirrhosis. Vaccination against hepatitis B is the best means of preventing infection with hepatitis D.\n(Choice E) Infectious mononucleosis can lead to hepatitis in adolescents and young adults. Signs and symptoms typically include sore throat, fever, lymphadenopathy, rash, and splenomegaly."

      "D. Radiograph of the abdomen",
      "E. Serological testing for viral titers"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas and the surrounding tissues that arises when activated, destructive pancreatic enzymes are released in an uncontrolled fashion. In the United States the two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are heavy alcohol intake and gallstones. Other conditions less often associated with pancreatitis include hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, medication usage (eg, antibiotics, diuretics, estrogen, immunosuppressives), genetic mutations, infection, trauma, pancreas divisum (a common anatomic variant), vascular disease, pregnancy, post-ERCP state, and idiopathic causes. Epidemiologically, women are more likely to develop gallstone pancreatitis, while men are more likely to develop alcoholic pancreatitis. Children are most prone to the hereditary, infectious, or traumatic forms of pancreatitis.\nAn estimation of disease severity can be calculated using scoring systems, such as Ranson's criteria (which uses age and a number of laboratory findings over a 48 hour period) or the APACHE II (which uses physiology, age, and chronic health).\nThe treatment of acute pancreatitis is focused on correcting underlying predisposing factors and at resolving the inflammation. Mild pancreatitis should be treated with pain control, intravenous fluids, and nothing by mouth. Most patients will recover within 5-7 days. Moderate to severe pancreatitis requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and pain management, as well as systemic antibiotics. Surgical debridement is an option for patients with infected necrosis but is associated with high mortality.\n(Choice A) Abdominal CT scan is the most valuable imaging test in the identification of the presence, severity, and complications of pancreatitis. Those patients with clinical and biochemical findings suggestive of pancreatitis who fail to improve with conservative treatment should undergo abdominal CT scan to identify areas of infection or necrosis. Because CT scan is of limited use in the evaluation of gallstones, however, it would not be the best means of identifying the etiology of this woman's condition.\n(Choice B) The HIDA scan is an excellent tool in the diagnosis of cystic duct obstruction (cholecystitis). It is not of help in detecting non-obstructive gallstones.\n(Choice D) In the United States, an abdominal radiograph is of limited utility in the detection of gallstones because over 80% of all gallstones are radiolucent.\n(Choice E) Viral pancreatitis is uncommon. Ordering viral titers is not generally recommended unless suggested by specific presentation of a viral illness e.g., mumps."

Cholangiography showed beading of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Primary biliary cirrhosis",
      "B. Primary sclerosing cholangitis",
      "C. Polyarteritis nodosa",
      "D. Acute cholecystitis",
      "E. Acute cholangitis",
      "F. Microscopic polyangiitis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic and progressive condition characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of the medium- and large-sized ducts of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. Histologically, fibrous obliteration of the small bile ducts is seen, with connective tissue deposited concentrically in an \"onion skin\" pattern. Continued destruction of the bile ducts results in end-stage liver disease and portal hypertension. Eventual complications of PSC include biliary stricture, cholangitis and cholelithiasis, cholangiocarcinoma, and colon cancer. A significant number (estimates range from 25-90%) of afflicted individuals have underlying inflammatory bowel disease, most commonly ulcerative colitis. Men develop PSC more often than women, and the mean age at diagnosis is 40 years.\nTreatment options include ursodeoxycholic acid, endoscopic therapy for dilation and stenting of dominant strictures, or liver transplantation.\nBecause PSC is a progressive condition, the prognosis includes cholestatic complications (eg, fatigue, pruritus, steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, metabolic bone disease) and hepatic failure. Those patients who do not undergo liver transplantation have a mean survival of 12 years after diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is more common in females by a ratio of 9:1 and is not characterized by jaundice or pruritus until late in the disease. There is no association of PBC with inflammatory bowel disease, and anti-mitochondrial antibodies are typically positive.\n(Choice C) The more common clinical manifestations of polyarteritis nodosa include systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, weight loss), neuropathy, arthralgias or myalgias, cutaneous findings (eg, livedo reticularis), renal disease, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, respiratory manifestations, central nervous system dysfunction, orchitis, and coronary involvement. There is no association with IBD, and the diagnosis must be confirmed with tissue biopsy that demonstrates a necrotizing vasculitis of the small- and medium-sized arteries.\n(Choice D) Acute cholecystitis typically develops after a large or fatty meal and is characterized by the sudden appearance of steady pain in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant. The pain may radiate to the right scapula or be accompanied by Murphy's sign, which is the sharp arrest of inspiration with gallbladder palpation. Other classical findings include fever, vomiting, and leukocytosis. This patient's presentation is not consistent with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.\n(Choice E) Acute cholangitis is characterized by severe jaundice, fever, and right upper quadrant pain with leukocytosis. While patients afflicted with PSC may experience acute cholangitis, such a diagnosis is not consistent with this patient's presentation.\n(Choice F) Microscopic polyangiitis is a pauci-immune, necrotizing vasculitis of small vessels. While it is often p-ANCA positive, it is not associated with IBD and typically presents with a wide range of organ-specific manifestations (eg, skin rash, hemoptysis, chest pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, arthralgias)."

    "question": "A 52-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of dark urine and \"feeling very itchy all over.\" Further inquiry reveals that he also has been experiencing episodes of right upper quadrant pain that awakens him from sleep and lasts for 2-4 hours at a time. He says that the pain radiates to his right scapula and is severe, dull, and constant. His medical history is significant for hypothyroidism managed with medication and a remote cholecystectomy. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day since high school and drinks alcohol on social occasions. He does not use illicit drugs. Laboratory evaluation includes the following:\nLiver studies\nTotal bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin 4.1 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 455 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) 80 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) 101 U/L\nA sphincter of Oddi spasm is suspected based on his symptoms and history. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy is performed. Two days later, the patient's bilirubin begins to decrease, but imaging reveals air within in the biliary tree. What is the most likely cause of this finding?",
    "options": [
      "A. Normal finding after ERCP",
      "B. Acute pancreatitis",
      "C. Biliary infection with gas-forming bacteria",
      "D. Gangrenous cholecystitis",
      "E. Biliary enteric fistula"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is one of the most sensitive and specific tools for imaging the biliary system, and is particularly useful if therapeutic intervention is planned. It is typically used to explore the common bile duct, to clear stones from the common bile duct, to sample tissue for diagnostic purposes, to relieve sphincter of Oddi dysfunction by incising the musculature, and to palliate biliary obstruction when surgery is not planned. However, the procedure is not without risk, with an overall complication rate of 5-10% and a mortality rate of 1.5%. Some of the more common complications of ERCP include pancreatitis, perforation (resulting in biliary enteric fistula, especially after sphincterotomy), biliary peritonitis, sepsis, hemorrhage, and adverse effects from the contrast, sedative, or anticholinergic agents.\nGiven this patient's presentation, then, it is most likely that he has air in the biliary tree as a normal consequence of the sphincterotomy performed during ERCP, which allows reflux of intestinal contents/air into the biliary system.\n(Choice B) Acute pancreatitis is a known complication of ERCP but will not cause the appearance of gas in the biliary tree. Pancreatitis occurs in approximately 5% of all patients undergoing ERCP and is seen in up to 25% of patients who are undergoing ERCP for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction specifically.\n(Choice C) Biliary infection with gas-forming bacteria will create shadowing within the biliary tree and will cause the patient to look very toxic. Because the patient in this scenario underwent ERCP two days ago, however, an iatrogenic cause (sphincterotomy) is much more likely than a new infection.\n(Choice D) Gangrenous cholecystitis will cause the formation of gas within the gallbladder, not the biliary tree. In addition, patients with this condition are septic. This patient had a remote cholecystectomy.\n(Choice E) A biliary enteric fistula, possibly due to perforation during ERCP, could cause air in the biliary tree, but this is a serious complication, whereas air after sphincterotomy alone is often a normal finding. Without signs of peritonitis or sepsis, the normal post-procedural finding is more likely."

    "question": "A 42-year-old Caucasian female who works as a registered nurse at a local homeless shelter presents for an annual physical exam. She mentions that she feels anxiety about her close contact with so many high-risk patients because of the possibility of acquiring HIV or viral hepatitis. She has with her today a recent serology report obtained from an outside hospital, which includes the following:\nHepatitis Panel:\nHBsAg Negative\nAnti-HBsAg Positive\nAnti-HBcAg Negative\nHBeAg Negative\nAnti-HBeAg Negative\nAnti-HAV IgM Negative\nAnti-HAV IgG Negative\nAnti-HCV Negative\nWhat is an appropriate interpretation of these serological test results?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute hepatitis B infection",
      "B. Chronic hepatitis B infection",
      "C. Vaccination against hepatitis B infection",
      "D. Prior hepatitis B infection",
      "E. Recovery phase of hepatitis B infection"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The hepatitis B vaccine is a safe and highly effective recombinant vaccine that contains HBsAg, a surface antigen that stimulates the production of anti-HBsAg in the host. Anti-HBsAg is a protective antibody and confers lifelong immunity to vaccinated individuals. Therefore, seronegative individuals who receive the vaccination will develop immunity and be positive for anti-HBsAg but negative for HBsAg.\nSerological markers for the hepatitis B virus include the following:\nHBsAg: The first virological marker detected in the serum after inoculation, it precedes both the elevation of serum aminotransferases and the onset of clinical symptoms. It remains detectable during the entire symptomatic phase of acute hepatitis B and chronic infections.\nAnti-HBs: Appearing in the serum after either successful HBV vaccination or the clearance of HBsAg, this marker remains detectable for life. It serves as an indicator of noninfectivity and immunity. However, there is a time lag between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs in the serum, which is termed the \"window period.\"\nHBcAg: This marker is not detectable in serum as it is normally sequestrated within the HBsAg coat.\nAnti-HBc: Appearing in the serum shortly after the emergence of HBsAg, this marker remains detectable long after the patient recovers. The IgM fraction signals the acute phase of disease, whereas the IgG fraction signals recovery from the disease. Because IgM anti-HBc is present in the \"window period,\" it is an important tool for diagnosis when HBsAg has been cleared and anti-HBs is not yet detectable. Thus IgM anti-HBc is the most specific marker for diagnosis of acute hepatitis B.\nHBeAg: This antigen is detectable shortly after the appearance of HBsAg and indicates active viral replication and infectivity. It is associated with the presence of HBV DNA. HBeAg tends to disappear shortly after aminotransferase levels peak and before HBsAg is eliminated, and is followed by the appearance of anti-HBe. Should it persist for more than three months, there is an increased likelihood of chronic hepatitis B.\nAnti-HBe: This marker suggests the cessation of active viral replication and low infectivity.\n(Choice A) Acute hepatitis B infection would be characterized by the presence of HBsAg, HBeAg, and IgM anti-HBcAg.\n(Choice B) Chronic hepatitis B infection is defined by the presence of HBsAg in the serum for more than six months. However, this patient lacks HBsAg and has no known history of HBV infection.\n(Choice D) Individuals with prior hepatitis B infection are positive for anti-HBsAg and negative for HBsAg but will also be positive for anti-HBcAg, the IgG type antibody directed against the core viral antigen HBcAg. Because the HBV vaccine does not contain this core antigen, no antibodies are made against it in the vaccinated patient population. Therefore, anti-HBcAg is only seen in those naturally immunized by prior hepatitis B infection.\n(Choice E) The recovery phase of hepatitis B infection is characterized by the presence of three antibodies: anti-HBsAg, anti-HBcAg (predominantly IgG), and anti-HBeAg. The antigens HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBeAg are not seen because they have already been cleared from circulation."

    "question": "A 42-year-old female nurse presents to clinic for routine follow-up of her diabetes mellitus. She has been obese since childhood and has been unsuccessful in controlling her weight through diet or exercise. She denies drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, or using recreational drugs. Laboratory evaluation reveals the following:\nLiver studies\nAlbumin 4.0 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 141 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 82 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 93 U/L\nChemistry panel\nSerum sodium 141 mEq/L\nSerum potassium 4.6 mEq/L\nChloride 104 mEq/L\nBicarbonate 26 mEq/L\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) 14 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nCalcium 9.4 mg/dL\nBlood glucose 168 mg/dL\nProthrombin time 12 seconds\nPartial thromboplastin time 28 seconds\nAntinuclear antibody Negative\nSmooth muscle antibody Negative\nHepatitis Panel\nHBsAg Negative\nAnti-HBsAg Positive\nAnti-HBc Negative\nHBeAg Negative\nAnti-HBeAg Negative\nAnti-HAV IgM Negative\nAnti-HAV IgG Negative\nAnti-HCV Negative\nLiver biopsy reveals macrovesicular steatosis, polymorphonuclear cellular infiltrates, and necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis",
      "B. Alcoholic fatty liver",
      "C. Primary biliary cirrhosis",
      "D. Autoimmune hepatitis",
      "E. Granulomatous hepatitis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The histologic features of this patient's hepatic tissue are indistinguishable from those of alcoholic hepatitis. Because she is a non-drinker, however, her condition is instead termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The top three risk factors for NASH include obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertriglyceridemia. The incidence of NASH has risen in tandem with the increase in obesity, with approximately 40% of obese patients demonstrating some degree of steatosis on liver biopsy. Other risk factors include the usage of specific medications (eg, corticosteroids, amiodarone, diltiazem, tamoxifen, HAART), total parenteral nutrition, and endocrinopathies (eg, Cushing's syndrome).\nPathophysiologically, NASH is characterized by an impaired responsiveness of fat cells to insulin, thereby causing an accumulation of fat in the liver. This steatosis can then progress to steatohepatitis and fibrosis, likely secondary to lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.\nClinically, the majority of patients with NASH have hepatomegaly, but the stigmata of chronic liver disease are rarely seen. Laboratory studies typically show mild elevation in aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase, with the AST/ALT ratio less than 1. Diagnosis is established with a percutaneous liver biopsy. Hepatic fibrosis eventually develops in 40% of individuals with NASH, and cirrhosis in 10-15%. Treatment of NASH primarily aims to control the underlying comorbid conditions, with ursodeoxycholic acid of some help in decreasing transaminase levels and improving liver histologic features.\n(Choice B) Fatty liver is histologically characterized by the excessive accumulation of fat, most prominently in the centrilobular zone. Macrovesicular steatosis is often noted. Frequently, the hepatocyte nucleus is displaced eccentrically by one or more large fat droplets. Fatty liver develops in 90-100% of heavy alcohol users.\n(Choice C) Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by marked jaundice, pruritus, and positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Histologically, portal tracts are infiltrated by lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and progressive destruction are seen in the terminal and conducting bile ducts. Eventually, portal tract scarring and bridging fibrosis cause the liver to become cirrhotic.\n(Choice D) Classic autoimmune hepatitis is characterized by the presence of anti-smooth muscle antibodies or ANA in the serum. Histologically, a prominent and inflammatory infiltration of the liver with lymphocytes and plasma cells (the latter a more unusual phenomenon in chronic hepatitis) is observed."

    "question": "A 42-year-old woman with severe uterine bleeding and iron deficiency anemia is receiving a blood transfusion prior to undergoing a hysterectomy. Thirty minutes after the transfusion starts she begins to complain of fever, chills, and flank pain. The transfusion is stopped but she continues to complain of symptoms and eventually begins bleeding around her intravenous catheter site. What is the most likely cause of her transfusion reaction?",
    "options": [
      "A. Reaction to cytokines stored in the transfused blood product",
      "B. ABO mismatching",
      "C. IgA deficiency",
      "D. Blood product contamination with bacteria",
      "E. Anamnestic antibody response against a minor RBC antigen"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This woman is having an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) which typically develops within an hour after the transfusion is started. Blood transfusion reactions are relatively common, affecting up to 6% of all transfusions. Fortunately, many reactions can be avoided with leukoreduction, RBC washing, and rigorous cross-matching. Unfortunately, some of the reactions are serious or life-threatening. One of the most serious reactions is acute hemolysis, where donor erythrocytes are rapidly destroyed by preformed recipient antibodies. Typically this is due to ABO mismatching from a clinical error or blood mistyping, but it can occur in some patients with certain acquired alloantibodies. AHTR classically presents with fever, chills, flank pain, and hemoglobinuria. Diagnosis is made by a positive direct Coombs test, plasma free hemoglobin showing pink plasma with a hemoglobin concentration greater than 25 mg/dL, hemoglobinuria, and repeat typing and cross-matching revealing a mismatch. Complications include disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and shock. Treatment is supportive.\n(Choice A) Reaction to cytokines stored in the transfused blood products is thought to be the leading cause of febrile nonhemolytic reactions, the most common transfusion reaction. During blood storage, leukocytes release cytokines, which when transfused cause transient fevers, chills, and malaise. This reaction can largely be prevented by using leukoreduced blood products, particularly if the RBCs are washed.\n(Choice C) IgA deficiency is a major risk factor for developing an anaphylactic reaction to blood products. Anaphylaxis typically occurs within seconds to minutes of the infusion start time. It develops because some IgA deficient patients have anti-IgA IgG antibodies. It can be prevented by using IgA-deficient blood products or performing extra washes of the blood product.\n(Choice D) Despite rigorous screening standards, a very small percentage of blood products are contaminated with infectious organisms. The presentation is variable but most patients develop fever within 24 hours.\n(Choice E) Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions result from an anamnestic antibody response to an RBC antigen to which the patient has previously encountered. Exposure may occur via pregnancy, transplant, or transfusion. The antibody is undetectable prior to transfusion but reappears rapidly following transfusion. It typically causes low-grade hemolysis 2 to 10 days after the transfusion."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism presents at clinic complaining of abdominal distention and weight loss. He is uncertain as to when his symptoms began. He has been drinking half of a bottle of whiskey every night for the past twenty years. His medical history is significant for a chronic lower back pain, diverticulosis, and an attack of acute pancreatitis three years ago. He is currently unemployed and lives with his son. Physical examination reveals gynecomastia, a firm enlarged liver, and free fluid in the abdomen. Esophagoscopy demonstrates large esophageal varices. He denies any history of hematemesis. Which of the following is preferred for the prevention of hematemesis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Weekly infusion of intravenous octreotide",
      "B. Prophylactic band ligation of varices",
      "C. Prophylactic endoscopic sclerotherapy",
      "D. Prophylactic non selective beta-blocker therapy",
      "E. No intervention is necessary aside from education about alcohol abstinence"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has signs of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, including ascites and esophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension. Portal hypertension develops from increased resistance to portal flow at the sinusoids and causes increased pressure at the portosystemic collateral veins in the anterior abdomen, lower rectum, and the lower end of esophagus where the portal and systemic circulations meet. This phenomenon is responsible for the esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, and caput medusae commonly seen in cirrhotic patients. Studies have shown that approximately one-third of all patients with esophageal varices will eventually hemorrhage, and each episode of variceal hemorrhage carries a 30% risk of mortality.\nMost experts advise that pharmacologic treatment with a non-selective beta-blocker such as propranolol is best in this patient population. These non-selective beta-blockers work by decreasing portal venous inflow. Clinical studies indicate that beta-blocker usage reduces the risk of a first variceal bleed by half. To ensure appropriate effect, the drug should be dosed to decrease the resting pulse by 25%.\nBeta-blockers have also been shown to be useful in the secondary prevention of recurrent bleeds. However, they are not appropriate in the acute control of hematemesis because hypovolemia-induced hypotension is typically already present, which is a contraindication to beta-blocker use.\n(Choice A) Octreotide appears to be a safe, effective adjunctive therapy after variceal obliteration procedures have been performed. It may also be used in the context of acute variceal bleeding. However, it is not appropriate as primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage.\n(Choice B) Band ligation of varices is appropriate for those patients with high-risk varices who are intolerant of beta-blockers. However, band ligation is not accepted as first-line therapy for primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage.\n(Choice C) Endoscopic sclerotherapy can effectively treat bleeding esophageal varices. However the available data suggest that beta-blockers are superior to sclerotherapy as primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage.\n(Choice E) This patient is at significant risk because he has decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. Prophylactic measures must be taken in an effort to prevent variceal hemorrhage. To do nothing would be inappropriate."

    "question": "A 45-year-old female undergoes an elective cholecystectomy for gallstones causing recurrent severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain.

During an acute pain episode, her laboratory reports show ALT: 80 IU/L, AST: 70 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase: 450 IU/L, and total bilirubin: 1.6 mg/dl. Ultrasonogram of abdomen and ERCP are done and show normal bile ducts and pancreas. A sphincter of Oddi manometry is done which shows markedly elevated pressures. What would be the most appropriate intervention for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Do a surgical resection of pancreatic head",
      "B. Give her nitrates",
      "C. Give her calcium channel blockers",
      "D. Do an ERCP sphincterotomy",
      "E. Give her analgesics"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is having sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, which is causing post cholecystectomy pain in her. Post cholecystectomy pain is generally due to a functional etiology, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, or common bile duct stones. However, a normal ERCP and ultrasonogram rule out common bile duct stones. Functional pain is a diagnosis of exclusion. An elevated biliary sphincter pressure is highly specific for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter dysfunction is characterized by right upper quadrant pain and elevation of liver enzymes during the pain attack, which resolve when the attacks subside. ERCP with a sphincterotomy is the most appropriate treatment for sphincter dysfunction (Choice D).\n(Choice B, C, and E) Calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and analgesics are not effective in treatment of sphincter dysfunction.\n(Choice A) Surgical resection of the pancreatic head is the treatment of choice for periampullary carcinoma but not for sphincter dysfunction."

    "question": "A 40-year-old Asian American female presents to clinic with the complaint of mild pruritus for the past several months. A review of systems is positive for very dark urine for the past two weeks and severe fatigue of insidious onset. Her medical history is otherwise unremarkable. She takes no medications. She lives with her husband and three children and works in a grocery store. Vital signs include temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 118/72 mm Hg, pulse of 68/min, and respirations of 12/min. Physical examination reveals xanthelasmas and yellow sclerae.

    "options": [
      "A. Cholestyramine",
      "B. Liver transplantation",
      "C. Ursodeoxycholic acid",
      "D. Glucocorticoids",
      "E. Methotrexate"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is afflicted with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a chronic liver disease characterized by autoimmune destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts and cholestasis. The condition presents most commonly in middle-aged women and is insidious in onset. Pruritus is usually the first symptom and may be very severe, especially at night. Fatigue is also often reported. Physical findings typically include hepatosplenomegaly and xanthomatous lesions in the eyelids or in the skin and tendons. As the disease progresses, jaundice, steatorrhea, portal hypertension, and osteopenia may develop.\nAbnormalities on laboratory testing are consistent with cholestasis and include elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol, as well as elevated serum IgM. Diagnosis is confirmed with demonstration of anti-mitochondrial antibodies in the serum. Associated conditions include Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's syndrome, scleroderma, autoimmune thyroid disease, hypothyroidism, and celiac disease. The risk of hepatobiliary malignancy is elevated in those patients diagnosed with PBC.\nUrsodeoxycholic acid is the drug of choice in treating PBC, as it slows disease progression and relieves symptoms. Methotrexate and colchicine have also been shown to be of moderate benefit. Advanced disease is an indication for liver transplantation, which offers a 1-year survival rate of 85-90% and is the only definitive treatment. Without transplantation, survival averages 7-10 years after symptoms first arise.\n(Choice A) Cholestyramine forms a nonabsorbable complex with bile acids in the small intestine, thereby increasing the fecal loss of bile salts and cholesterol. It is helpful in reducing the severe pruritus and hypercholesterolemia seen in patients with PBC, but it has no impact upon survival rates. It is therefore considered a second-line drug for the control of severe symptoms.\n(Choice B) Liver transplantation is the sole definitive cure for progressive PBC, but it is indicated only in those patients with severe liver damage or cirrhosis. As this patient has no signs or symptoms of cirrhosis, a trial of ursodeoxycholic acid is more appropriate.\n(Choice D) Glucocorticoids are considered to be ineffective in the treatment of PBC.\n(Choice E) Methotrexate is thought to act as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of PBC. However, not all studies have demonstrated that this drug slows disease progression or improves transplant-free survival rates. It is therefore not a first-line drug in the treatment of PBC."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "About 50 to 70 % of patients with acute hepatitis C progress to chronic hepatitis C regardless of the mode of acquisition. Progression of liver disease in case of chronic hepatitis C is best assessed by liver histology. Progression of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis is relatively more rapid in following conditions:\n1. Male sex\n2. Acquiring infection after age of 40\n3. Longer duration of infection\n4. Co infection with HBV or HIV\n5. Immunosuppression\n6. Liver co morbidities like alcoholic liver disease, hemochromatosis, alpha-1 anti trypsin deficiency\nFactors independently associated with high rates of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C patients are:\n1. Male gender\n2. Acquiring infection after age of 40\n3. Alcohol intake: alcohol intake in any amount can hasten the progression of fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C\n(Choice A) She has the least progression of fibrosis among the given sets of patients due to her female sex, earlier age of acquisition of infection, non alcoholic state, and no liver co morbidities or infections.\n(Choice B) Infection after the age of 40 is an independent risk factor for progression of fibrosis.\n(Choices C and D) Co infection with hepatitis B or HIV is a risk factor for rapid progression of fibrosis.\n(Choice E) Although patient has infection at younger age and is a non-alcoholic, his male sex is an additional risk factor as compared to patient in Choice A."

The incubation period for hepatitis B infection is 30-180 days.\n(Choice C) Administering only the hepatitis B vaccine would provide long-term active immunity in case of future exposure. However, the vaccine provides no immediate protection against the imminent danger of seroconversion, which is why hepatitis B immune globulin is necessary.\n(Choice D) Followup alone is the worst choice because once the patient seroconverts and develops active hepatitis B infection, there are no treatment options available.\n(Choice E) Administering human immune globulin (HBIG) alone would provide the patient with immediate passive protection. However, HBIG would not protect against future infection because active immunization is necessary to stimulate continuous antibody production."

    "question": "A 58-year-old Caucasian male presents at clinic complaining of fatigue and abdominal distention. He says that he has been so tired recently that he decided to take a four-week leave of absence from his job as a deliveryman. His medical history is remarkable for hiatal hernia, diverticulosis, and osteoarthritis. He drinks 12 beers and smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. He lives with his wife and adult son. Vital signs include temperature of 37.0 C (98.6 F), blood pressure of 132/86 mm Hg, pulse of 80/min, and respirations of 18/min. On physical examination, his liver extends 4 centimeters below the left costal margin. The spleen is palpable. There are spider nevi on the upper torso and shifting dullness of his abdomen. Which of the following medications is the preferred initial treatment for this patient's ascites?",
    "options": [
      "A. Furosemide",
      "B. Thiazide",
      "C. Spironolactone",
      "D. Triamterene",
      "E. Mannitol"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Patients with cirrhosis develop ascites as a result of multiple mechanisms, including portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, peripheral vasodilation, limited hepatic inactivation of aldosterone, and increased aldosterone secretion (secondary to increased renin production). This secondary hyperaldosteronism is considered most responsible for cirrhotic ascites. Treatment of this condition should include the following:\n1. Diagnostic paracentesis, with examination for cell count and culture and ascitic albumin level. The latter allows calculation of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (serum albumin minus ascitic albumin). SAAG levels >= 1.1 suggest portal hypertension.\n2. Salt-restricted diet, which may allow for complete resolution of the ascites without additional therapy in a subset of patients.\n3. Spironolactone, generally in conjunction with furosemide, for patients who do not improve with salt restriction. Spironolactone is an aldosterone-receptor antagonist and is the diuretic of choice in ascites secondary to cirrhosis.\n4. Patients with massive ascites, refractory ascites, or respiratory compromise may benefit from early large-volume paracentesis.\n5. Recalcitrant ascites may require a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.\n(Choice A) A potent loop diuretic such as furosemide is generally given in combination with spironolactone as a means of augmenting diuresis in these patients. Furosemide is not the primary medication to use in treating cirrhotic ascites, however.\n(Choice B) Thiazide diuretics can be given to patients with ascites, but are less effective than spironolactone.\n(Choice D) Patients who cannot tolerate spironolactone may be given another potassium-sparing diuretic, such as triamterene or amiloride. These are not first-line agents, however.\n(Choice E) Mannitol is an osmotic agent used for the treatment of cerebral edema and acute prerenal failure. It is not used in the management of ascites secondary to cirrhosis."

    "question": "A 65-year-old Caucasian male undergoes coronary artery bypass grafting in an effort to relieve ischemic symptoms that had severely limited his ability to work and exercise. Intraoperatively, he requires ten units of packed red blood cells to maintain his oxygen-carrying capacity. The surgery is successful and the patient is stable post-operatively. On the second postoperative day, he develops jaundice. He is afebrile and a physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings include the following:\nLiver studies\nAlbumin 3.8 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 9.2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 335 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) 55 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) 61 U/L\nAmylase 76 U/L\nLipase 60 U/L\nCoagulation studies\nProthrombin time 12 sec\nPartial thromboplastin time 33 sec\nWhat is most likely responsible for this patient's jaundice?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute liver failure",
      "B. Postoperative cholestasis",
      "C. Post-transfusion hepatitis",
      "D. Halothane hepatitis",
      "E. Acute hepatic infarct"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has postoperative cholestasis, a benign condition that often develops after a major surgery characterized by hypotension, extensive blood loss into tissues, and massive blood replacement. The jaundice is thought to develop secondary to three factors: increased pigment load (caused by the transfusion); decreased liver functionality (caused by hypotension); and decreased renal bilirubin excretion (caused by tubular necrosis). Generally, jaundice is evident by the second or third day after a prolonged surgery, with the bilirubin levels peaking at 10-40 mg/dL by the tenth postoperative day. Although alkaline phosphatase levels can also be markedly elevated, the AST and ALT levels are typically normal or only mildly elevated.\n(Choice A) Acute liver failure is associated with an elevated prothrombin time and neurological signs and symptoms suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. Decreased serum albumin levels may be seen, especially in those patients with end-stage liver disease.\n(Choice C) Post-transfusion hepatitis is not a common problem now because all blood products are screened. It is estimated that the risk of contracting hepatitis C is <=1/540,000 units transfused.\n(Choice D) Because of concerns about halothane hepatotoxicity, this anesthetic is almost never used in the United States. When halothane hepatotoxicity does arise, it is characterized by one of two patterns. Type 1 is associated with aminotransferase elevation with mild or no symptoms. Type 2 is associated with severe or fulminant hepatitis. It is highly unlikely that this patient received halothane during surgery. Moreover, his presentation is not consistent with either of the two types.\n(Choice E) Because the liver has a dual blood supply through the hepatic arteries and portal veins, hepatic infarct is not a common condition. Both sources provide oxygen supply. When ischemic hepatitis does occur (as in a person who has recently undergone liver transplantation), signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and liver enlargement."

    "question": "A 31-year-old Caucasian female presents complaining of a dull, aching pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications except for oral contraceptive pills, which she has used as birth control for the past ten years. She does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs, but does drink one or two glasses of wine on social occasions. Physical examination is noncontributory except for the presence of a palpable liver mass. Laboratory evaluation shows the following:\nLiver studies\nAlbumin 4.1 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 215 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) 45 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) 40 U/L\nGamma glutamyl transpeptidase 92 U/L (normal 5-55 U/L)\nAlpha-fetoprotein 6 ng/mL (normal 0-15 ng/mL)\nA biopsy of the mass is performed, and the pathology report describes mildly atypical enlarged hepatocytes containing glycogen and lipid deposits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Focal nodular hyperplasia",
      "B. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma",
      "C. Metastasis to the liver",
      "D. Hepatic adenoma"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Hepatic adenomas are uncommon benign epithelial tumors of the liver that usually arise as a solitary mass in the right hepatic lobe. They are found predominantly in young and middle-aged women who have a lengthy history of oral contraceptive usage. Hepatic adenomas may also be seen in association with anabolic androgen use, glycogen storage disease, pregnancy, and diabetes mellitus. A hormonally mediated pathogenesis is suspected, but the mechanism is not well understood.\nHistologically, hepatic adenomas contain sheets of enlarged adenoma cells that contain glycogen and lipid.\nPatients who are not symptomatic can be initially managed conservatively with discontinuation of oral contraceptives and careful observation with repeated imaging and serial AFP measurements. Complete regression of the tumor can happen with conservative therapy, but growth, rupture, and malignant transformation are also possibilities. Because of these risks, some experts recommend the resection of all hepatic adenomas, regardless of size or symptoms.\n(Choice A) Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a very common non-malignant hepatic tumor that is not of vascular origin. It arises as a hyperplastic response to hyperperfusion by anomalous arteries that are present in the center of the nodule. The biopsy usually shows sinusoids and Kupffer cells, neither of which is seen with hepatic adenomas. FNH is not associated with the use of oral contraceptives.\n(Choice B) Primary hepatocellular carcinoma is highly unusual in young patients who do not have a history of viral hepatitis (B or C) or chronic heavy alcohol use. Histological findings associated with hepatocellular carcinoma vary, ranging from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated lesions that contain large, multinucleated, anaplastic cells. Central necrosis within larger tumors is common.\n(Choice C) Metastatic liver tumors are the most common hepatic neoplasm in the United States. Primary sources are quite varied and include the colon, stomach, pancreas, breast, skin (melanoma), and thyroid. Typically, when metastasis has occurred, multiple lesions are present in the liver and the cells are markedly atypical.\n(Choice E) There are four species of Echinococcus that cause infection in humans, with the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus the most common cause of hydatid cysts (cystic echinococcosis). When seen in the United States, most cases occur either in immigrants from endemic countries or in individuals who live in the Southwest region of the country and are exposed to sheep and dogs (two animals that participate in the tapeworm life cycle). The initial infection is always asymptomatic, with subsequent signs and symptoms dependent upon the site of the cysts and their size. The liver is affected in most patients, and hydatid cysts in this location may ultimately cause hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. Microscopic examination of the tissue demonstrates a characteristic encapsulated and calcified cyst that contains fluid and budding cells that will eventually become daughter cysts."

    "question": "A 55-year-old overweight Caucasian male with a lengthy medical history presents to his primary care physician complaining of pedal edema and abdominal distention. He says that he first noticed these symptoms after realizing \"my pants no longer fit at the waist and the elastic bands of my socks now leave deep imprints on my legs.\" Physical examination reveals bilateral gynecomastia and spider angiomata on the upper extremities. Caput medusae are present on the abdominal wall. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Alcoholism",
      "B. Hepatitis B",
      "C. Hepatitis C",
      "D. Wilson's disease",
      "E. Hemochromatosis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Alcoholism is the most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States, and the incidence of alcoholic cirrhosis has been steadily increasing over the past decade. One-third of chronic alcoholics will develop alcoholic hepatitis, and 10-15% will develop cirrhosis. The risk of developing cirrhosis in alcoholics is directly related to the amount and the duration of alcohol consumption. Concurrent infection with HBV or HCV tends to significantly increase the severity of the alcoholic liver disease.\nPathophysiologically, alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by inflammation and parenchymal necrosis of the liver. Symptoms typically include fever, right upper quadrant pain, tender hepatomegaly, and jaundice, although some patients are asymptomatic. Laboratory findings include an elevated AST (rarely exceeding 300 U/L), with the AST classically measuring at least twice the ALT. A markedly prolonged prothrombin time is suggestive of a more severe alcoholic hepatitis with a mortality rate that approaches 50%. Treatment includes abstinence from alcohol, nutritional support, and corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone). Liver transplantation is considered in some cases.\n(Choice B) Approximately 10% of patients with hepatitis B infection will develop cirrhosis of the liver.\n(Choice C) Approximately 20-30% of patients with hepatitis C infection will develop cirrhosis of the liver. Infection with HC is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States.\n(Choice D) Wilson's disease is an unusual genetic disorder that results in the excessive accumulation of copper in tissue, which can cause hepatic injury. It Is not a common cause of cirrhosis.\n(Choice E) Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that results in the excessive accumulation of iron in tissue which can cause hepatic injury. It is not a common cause of cirrhosis."

    "question": "A 42-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician complaining of dyspepsia and bloating after meals. She also complains of occasional right upper quadrant abdominal pain that is steady and severe, often radiating to her right scapula. Further inquiry reveals that her symptoms typically occur after consuming a fatty meal. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, osteoarthritis, and lower back pain. Current medications include metformin, atenolol, lisinopril, ibuprofen, and oral contraceptives. She has no known drug allergies. Vital signs include temperature of 37.0 C (98.6 F), blood pressure of 138/87 mm Hg, pulse of 86/min, and respirations of 14/min. Physical examination reveals an obese woman in no apparent distress. There is no tenderness upon palpation of the chest wall. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel sounds. There is no evidence of icterus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)",
      "B. Abdominal radiograph",
      "C. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan",
      "D. Abdominal ultrasonography",
      "E. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiopancreatography"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is classical for gallstone disease (cholelithiasis), which is most common in those who are \"fat, fertile, female, and forty.\" Native American heritage, diabetes mellitus, obesity, rapid weight loss, and the usage of oral contraceptives all predispose to gallstone formation. Typically, patients will complain of bloating and dyspepsia after eating fatty foods. Occasional right upper quadrant abdominal pain is common.\nGallstones are primarily composed of either cholesterol or calcium bilirubinate, with the former type most common in the United States. The precipitation of small cholesterol crystals can result from increased cholesterol secretion, defects in bile salt aggregation, or delays in emptying the gallbladder.\nAbdominal ultrasonography is the best initial investigation for gallbladder disease as it is 95% sensitive. Ultrasound is also of benefit in diagnosing cholecystitis and cholelithiasis. While asymptomatic patients typically do not require treatment, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for those with symptomatic gallbladder disease.\n(Choice A) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) offers the most direct and accurate means of establishing the cause, location, and extent of bile duct obstruction. ERCP allows for prompt therapeutic intervention in the form of stone extraction, sphincterotomy, balloon dilation, or stent placement. It is therefore a preferred procedure when cholangitis or biliary obstruction with a stone appears likely.\n(Choice B) Abdominal radiographs are neither sensitive nor specific for detecting gallstones, as more than 80% of gallstones are radiolucent and will not be visualized.\n(Choice C) The HIDA scan uses Technetium-labeled iminodiacetic acid compounds to demonstrate bile duct obstruction, gallbladder disease, and bile leaks. It is superior to abdominal ultrasound in confirming suspected acute cholecystitis (especially of the acalculous type).\n(Choice E) Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is an excellent means of studying the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. It is not commonly utilized, however, because alternative procedures that are less invasive or more therapeutic are readily available."

    "question": "A 42-year-old Caucasian female presents to clinic complaining of severe fatigue and dark yellow urine. Further inquiry reveals that she is also experiencing anorexia, nausea, and malaise. She is uncertain as to when her symptoms began and believes they came on gradually. She has no chronic illnesses, takes no medications, and has no known drug allergies. She admits to having unprotected intercourse with six different partners within the past year. Her immunization history does not include vaccination against hepatitis B virus. Laboratory testing reveals the following:\nLiver studies\nTotal bilirubin 4.5 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 142 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) 184 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) 345 U/L\nWhich of the following is the best means of screening for hepatitis B infection in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc",
      "B. HBsAg and anti-HBs",
      "C. HBcAg",
      "D. HBeAg",
      "E. Anti-HBe"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Expected laboratory findings in a patient with acute hepatitis include significant elevations in ALT and AST (with ALT >= AST), followed by rises in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Because this patient's liver function tests are suggestive of acute hepatitis and she reports history of multiple sex partners, she is at high risk for infection with hepatitis B virus and should be screened accordingly.\nThe serological markers of hepatitis B develop over a specific time course, as outlined below.\nHBsAg: The first virological marker detected in the serum after inoculation, it precedes both the elevation of serum aminotransferases and the onset of clinical symptoms. It remains detectable during the entire symptomatic phase of acute hepatitis B and suggests infectivity.\nAnti-HBs: Appearing in the serum after either successful HBV vaccination or the clearance of HBsAg, this marker remains detectable for life. It serves as an indicator of noninfectivity and immunity. However, there is a time lag between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs in the serum, which is termed the \"window period.\"\nHBcAg: This marker is not detectable in serum as it is normally sequestrated within the HBsAg coat.\nAnti-HBc: Appearing in the serum shortly after the appearance of HBsAg, this marker remains detectable long after the patient recovers. The IgM fraction signals the acute phase of disease, whereas the IgG fraction signals recovery from the disease. Because IgM anti-HBc is present in the \"window period\" it is an important tool for diagnosis when HBsAg has been cleared and anti-HBs is not yet detectable. Thus IgM anti-HBc is the most specific marker for diagnosis of acute hepatitis B.\nHBeAg: This antigen is detectable shortly after the appearance of HBsAg and indicates active viral replication and infectivity. It is associated with the presence of HBV DNA. HBeAg tends to disappear shortly after aminotransferase levels peak and before HBsAg is eliminated, and is followed by the appearance of anti-HBe. Should it persist for more than three months, there is an increased likelihood of chronic hepatitis B.\nAnti-HBe: This marker suggests the cessation of active viral replication and low infectivity.\nTherefore, testing for both HBsAg and anti-HBc offers the best screening for acute hepatitis B infection, as it won't miss the window period when HBsAg has disappeared but anti-HBs has not yet appeared in the serum.\n(Choice B) Testing for HBsAg and anti-HBs will not diagnose hepatitis B infection in those patients who are in the window period.\n(Choice C) HBcAg is not detectable in serum and is therefore of no help in establishing the diagnosis.\n(Choice D) HBeAg is a good indicator of infectivity but is a poor screening tool as its levels typically fall early in the course of the disease.\n(Choice E) Anti-HBe is a good indicator that viral replication has ceased. However, its sensitivity is too poor to diagnose an acute infection."

    "question": "A 41-year-old Asian American woman presents to clinic complaining of severe shortness of breath, cough, and hemoptysis. She recently immigrated to the United States and reports that her father, who stayed behind in her country of origin, has similar respiratory symptoms. A chest radiograph reveals right upper lobe fibrosis and her sputum is positive for acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis is made and she is begun on a regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. She presents for a follow-up visit one month later and says that her symptoms have improved and she feels \"much better.\" Her sputum is now negative for acid-fast bacilli. Laboratory evaluation returns with the following:\nLiver studies\nAlbumin 4.8 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 42 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) 75 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) 87 U/L\nWhat is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Continue current treatment, with no additional intervention necessary",
      "B. Replace current regimen with second-line anti-tuberculosis medications",
      "C. Stop all anti-tuberculosis medications",
      "D. Perform liver biopsy",
      "E. Prescribe glucocorticoids"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Isoniazid is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly effective against replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis when used in conjunction with other agents such as rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Isoniazid (INH) is not without adverse effects, however, and has been associated with severe INH hepatitis and a much milder hepatotoxicity.\nIsoniazid hepatitis presents with clinical manifestations that are similar to those seen with viral hepatitis. The risk of developing this more ominous form of hepatotoxicity is estimated to be 2.6% for those who drink alcohol daily, already have liver disease, or are age 50 years and older. If signs and symptoms of INH hepatitis are observed, the drug should be discontinued immediately.\nIn contrast, it is estimated that 10-20% of patients taking INH will experience mild, subclinical hepatic injury demonstrated only by minor elevations in serum aminotransferases (typically < 100 IU/L). The prognosis is excellent in these patients and the condition is self-limited, allowing for INH therapy to be maintained with close follow-up. Because the patient in this question is relatively young and otherwise asymptomatic, she can continue taking INH as long as her liver function tests are regularly monitored and remain only mildly elevated.\n(Choice B) Most of the first-line antituberculosis drugs are hepatotoxic and should be replaced by second-line antituberculosis drugs in patients who develop significant hepatotoxicity with the initial regimen. This patient, however, shows no signs of severe hepatotoxicity. A change in treatment plan is not indicated.\n(Choice C) Although the patient's sputum is negative for acid-fast bacilli, she is not likely to have fully cleared the dormant bacilli after one month of treatment.\n(Choice D) A liver biopsy is indicated in patients with asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes of unknown etiology, as tissue examination will allow for a better understanding of the pathologic process involved. However, the aminotransferase elevations in this patient are most likely secondary to tuberculosis treatment. Therefore, no biopsy is indicated at this time.\n(Choice E) There is some evidence that glucocorticoids are of benefit in the treatment of severe miliary tuberculosis. However, this patient does not have miliary tuberculosis."

      "C. Hydatid liver disease",
      "D. Hepatic adenoma",
      "E. Angiosarcoma of the liver"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Metastases are the most common malignant neoplasms of the adult liver and are twenty times more common than hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver is the second most common site of metastatic spread (after the lymph nodes) because of its large size, dual blood supply, high perfusion rate, and the filtration function of Kupffer cells. The most common primary tumors to metastasize to the liver include malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast, and skin (melanoma).\nHepatic involvement include hepatomegaly, jaundice, cholestasis, and elevated alkaline phosphatase, and depend on the site and extent of metastasis.\nImaging modalities that identify hepatic metastases include ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI. Typically, multiple hepatic nodules of varying sizes are seen. Biopsy provides confirmation of the diagnosis.\nIn this patient, metastasis of colonic carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis given his age, long-standing gastrointestinal complaints, normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and ultrasound findings.\n(Choice A) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a far less common cause of hepatic malignancy than is metastasis from another source. When HCC is present, it is typically accompanied by an elevation of alpha-fetoprotein. Imaging of HCC usually reveals one lesion with poorly defined margins instead of several masses of varying sizes.\n(Choice C) There are four species of Echinococcus that cause infection in humans, with the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus the most common cause of hydatid cysts (cystic echinococcosis). When seen in the United States, most cases occur either in immigrants from endemic countries or in individuals who live in the Southwest region of the country and are exposed to sheep and dogs (two animals that participate in the tapeworm life cycle).

Microscopic examination of the tissue demonstrates a characteristic encapsulated and calcified cyst that contains fluid and budding cells that will eventually become daughter cysts.\n(Choice D) Hepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors of the liver that usually arise as a solitary mass in the right hepatic lobe. They are found predominantly in young and middle-aged women who have a lengthy history of oral contraceptive usage. Physical findings include a palpable abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, or jaundice. Liver function tests are elevated on occasion. Alpha-fetoprotein is normal unless malignant transformation of the tumor has occurred.\n(Choice E) Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare neoplasm of the liver characterized by vascular spaces that are lined with malignant cells. It is more common in older men who have been exposed to toxins such as vinyl chloride gas, inorganic arsenic compounds, and thorium dioxide."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Though this patient is still infected with HCV, he does not need any treatment other than yearly follow-up to look for abnormal liver enzymes. Studies have shown that patients with chronic hepatitis C who show persistently normal liver enzymes on multiple occasions have minimal histological abnormalities and so need not be treated (Choice A).\n(Choice B) In spite of repeatedly normal liver enzymes this patient is not free from HCV as evidenced by positive PCR for HCV RNA.\n(Choice C) Anti viral treatment in patients with normal aminotransferases can lead to persistently elevated ALT in about 20% of patients. Also the natural history of chronic hepatitis C with normal aminotransferase level is relatively benign and in this case antiviral treatment can lead to liver injury.\n(Choice D) Liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis C patients with persistently normal aminotransferase shows minimal liver damage and so liver biopsy is not indicated unless more severe liver injury is suspected.\n(Choice E) Liver transplantation is not indicated unless there are signs of progressive disease and/or decompensated cirrhosis."

      "E. Administer glucocorticoids for immune system modulation"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This chronic alcoholic is experiencing an acute abdomen with pain radiating to his back, leukocytosis, and markedly elevated serum amylase and lipase levels after binge drinking. His presentation is highly suggestive of acute pancreatitis.\nAcute pancreatitis is one of numerous conditions that cause an acute abdomen. It is managed conservatively, as most attacks are self-limiting and subside in 4-7 days with conservative treatment. This treatment regimen should include analgesics for pain (with meperidine or fentanyl favored over morphine), intravenous fluids to maintain intravascular volume, and no oral alimentation as a means of avoiding further pancreatic inflammation. Nasogastric suction is an option, as it appears to decrease gastrin release by the stomach and to prevent gastric contents from entering the duodenum.\n(Choice A) Exploratory laparotomy is appropriate for most conditions that cause an acute abdomen. Acute pancreatitis, however, does not fall into this category as it typically resolves with conservative treatment. Surgery may be of some help in the management of severe pancreatic necrosis, biliary pancreatitis, or in addressing specific complications.\n(Choice B) Prophylactic antibiotics are not used routinely in patients with acute pancreatitis. However, 30% of patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis will develop a local infection with predominantly gut-derived bacteria. In these patients, enteral feeding, decontamination of the gut with non-absorbable antibiotics, and prophylactic systemic antibiotics would be appropriate.\n(Choice D) ERCP is an effective treatment option in the management of severe biliary pancreatitis, as it allows for sphincterotomy and stone removal. It is not of benefit in treating acute pancreatitis secondary to ethanol abuse.\n(Choice E) Glucocorticoids have no role in the management of uncomplicated acute pancreatitis."

    "question": "A 45-year-old male comes to you because of weight loss and weakness of two months’ duration. Over this period, he has also noticed increase in skin pigmentation, polydipsia and polyuria. He has been in good health until now and his previous health examination one year ago was normal. His laboratory report shows serum ferritin 1100 ng/mL, transferrin saturation 55 % (normal is <= 45%), blood glucose 170 mg/dL, ALT 120 U/L, and AST 100 U/L. If this disease condition is left untreated, this patient is at risk for which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Skin cancer",
      "B. Hepatocellular carcinoma",
      "C. Pancreatic cancer",
      "D. Acute myeloid leukemia",
      "E. Brain tumor",
      "F. Adrenal carcinoma",
      "G. Renal cell carcinoma"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Clinical presentation of this patient is suggestive of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder of iron storage, where an appropriate increase in intestinal iron absorption results in deposition of excessive amounts of iron in parenchymal cells leading to tissue damage and organ failure. The liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and pituitary glands are the most commonly involved organs. Patients generally present with weakness, lassitude, weight loss, change in skin color, abdominal pain, loss of libido and symptoms of diabetes mellitus. A measurement of the percent transferrin saturation (more >= to 45%) and serum ferritin level (>=1000microg/L) is a simple and reliable screening test for hemochromatosis.\nAmong the given options, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most serious complications of excess hepatic iron deposition. The risk varies from a 20 to a 200-fold increase. Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for 30% of deaths in patients with hemochromatosis. Progressive iron deposition in the liver is associated with hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes and the eventual development of cirrhosis, which increases the risk of hepatocellular cancer.\nHepatocellular cancer is the seventh most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the ninth in women. The risk factors include: Chronic hepatitis B carrier state, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, environmental toxins, hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis or chronic liver disease of almost any cause."

    "question": "A 65-year-old alcoholic male was diagnosed with cirrhosis. He has had 2 episodes of hematemesis and had sclerotherapy done. He has minimal ascites at present and is on spironolactone, as well as a salt restricted diet. He has 2+ peripheral edema, but no asterixis or confusion. He now develops severe epistaxis, bleeding from the intravenous sites, and bloody diarrhea. Which of the following would be the treatment of choice for his bleeding disorder?",
    "options": [
      "A. Give him vitamin K",
      "B. Give him fresh frozen plasma",
      "C. Give him whole blood transfusion",
      "D. Give him platelet concentrate",
      "E. Give him purified factor VIII"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Patients with liver failure often develop bleeding disorders. This is because the liver synthesizes all the clotting factors except factor VIII. Chief among these are vitamin K dependent factors like factor II, VII, IX and X. Acute bleeding in patients with liver failure is best treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which has all the clotting factors (Choice B).\n(Choice A) Vitamin K can reverse the bleeding disorder if vitamin K deficiency is the cause. However in patients with liver failure hepatocytes cannot use vitamin K, even if it is administered. Also vitamin K does not act instantaneously and is not preferable for the acute control of bleeding.\n(Choice C) In this patient our main goal is to reverse the coagulopathy, which can be best accomplished with FFP and not whole blood as this has a lower concentration of clotting factors.\n(Choices D and E) Bleeding disorders in chronic liver disease or liver failure is not due to platelet disorders or factor VIII deficiency therefore platelet concentrates or purified factor VIII cannot be useful."

    "question": "A 54-year-old male comes with a lump in the abdomen, which he had noticed 1 week ago. He is known to have chronic pancreatitis and takes pancreatic enzyme supplements. On examination, his vitals are normal and there is a lump palpable in the upper abdomen. His laboratory report shows marked increase in serum amylase. Ultrasonogram of abdomen shows a collection of fluid about 4cm in diameter, just behind the pancreas. A diagnosis of pseudopancreatic cyst is made. What would be the best treatment for his condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Observe the patient for 5 more weeks.",
      "B. Do a gastrostomy and drainage of the cyst.",
      "C. Give antibiotics to the patient.",
      "D. Do a percutaneous drainage of the fluid.",
      "E. Give diuretics"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has a pseudopancreatic cyst secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Pseudopancreatic cysts are collections of amylase rich fluid, debris, and tissue in the lesser sac of peritoneum (or bursa omentalis minor) and it's not a true cyst as it lacks an epithelial lining.\n(Choice A) Pseudopancreatic cysts can resolve on their own over 6 weeks. Therefore all the uncomplicated pseudopancreatic cysts smaller than 5cm should be observed for 6 weeks before any therapeutic intervention is done.\n(Choices B and D) A pseudocyst that doesn't resolve spontaneously can lead to serious complications and should be treated with either percutaneous drainage or a gastrostomy (an opening in the posterior stomach wall which would drain the pseudocyst into the stomach).\n(Choice C) Pseudocysts are sterile and need no prophylactic antibiotics until an infection is suspected clinically.\n(Choice E) Unlike other fluid collections in which diuretics might be useful, these are not indicated in the treatment of a pseudocyst.\nEducational Objective:\nUncomplicated pseudopancreatic cysts smaller than 5cm should be observed for 6 weeks before any further therapeutic intervention."

      "C. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure",
      "D. Increased glomerular filtration pressure",
      "E. Primary hyperaldosteronism"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Peritoneal fluid can accumulate due to a number of different causes including portal hypertension, trauma, infection, pancreatitis, and malignancy. To distinguish among these, it is important to differentiate transudative from exudative fluid accumulations. This is done using the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). The SAAG is calculated by subtracting the ascites albumin concentration from the serum albumin concentration. A difference of 1.1 g/dl or greater is 95% accurate in diagnosing a transudative process consistent with portal hypertension. This patient's SAAG of 1.3 is diagnostic of portal hypertension, or increased hydrostatic pressure within the liver's capillary beds.\n(Choice A) Decreased liver synthetic function will cause a decrease in serum albumin concentration and an increase in INR. Hypoalbuminemia may contribute to edema in end stage liver disease but is not responsible for SAAGs of 1.1 or greater.\n(Choice B) Increased capillary permeability is the mechanism by which exudative ascites forms. This patient's SAAG of 1.3 is not consistent with exudative ascites.\n(Choice D) Increased glomerular filtration pressure will increase the glomerular filtration rate and decrease the serum creatinine concentration. It will not cause ascites.\n(Choice E) Although primary hyperaldosteronism causes sodium and water retention it typically does not cause edema due to spontaneous diuresis (aldosterone escape phenomena).\nEducational objective:\nThe serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is used to distinguish between portal hypertension and other causes of ascites. A SAAG of 1.1 g/dL or greater is consistent with portal hypertension."

      "D. The patient's ~andition ie nat doe ta hie aleabinl intake"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has signs of alcoholic liver disease. His history (i.e., heavy alcohol use), physical findings (e.g, hepatomegaly; remember that the normal liver span is 6-12 cm in the midclavicular line), and laboratory findings (i.e, elevated MCV, AST to ALT ratio of 2:1) are all consistent with the disease.\nHaving established the patient's diagnosis, the next step to answering this question is interpreting the pathology report from the liver biopsy. The three major pathological stages of alcoholic liver disease are: 1) Fatty liver (steatosis) 2) Alcoholic hepatitis and 3) Alcoholic fibrosis/cirrhosis. Fatty liver is the result of short term alcohol ingestion, whereas hepatitis and cirrhosis require long term, sustained alcohol use. Alcohol hepatitis is characterized by Mallory bodies, infiltration by neutrophils, liver cell necrosis, and a perivenular distribution of inflammation. Fatty liver, alcohol hepatitis, and even early fibrosis can all be potentially reversible if the patient stops alcohol ingestion.\nThis patient's biopsy describes the classic features of alcoholic hepatitis; therefore, the correct answer is that his condition can be completely reversible with the cessation of alcohol intake.\n(Choice C) True cirrhosis is characterized by the presence of regenerative nodules. This condition is irreversible, even with the cessation of alcohol intake.\n(Choice D) Even though the patient gives a clear history of alcohol use, it is important to consider other causes of hepatitis such as viral hepatitis; however, the viral serologies are all negative.\nEducational Objective:\nFatty liver (steatosis), alcoholic hepatitis and early fibrosis of the liver can be reversible with the cessation of alcohol intake. True cirrhosis (with regenerative nodules) is irreversible, regardless of alcohol abstinence."

      "E. Autoimmune hepatitis",
      "F. Primary biliary cirrhosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has compensated cirrhosis. The combination of cirrhosis, neuropsychiatric symptoms and Kayser-Fleischer rings (brownish or gray-green rings of fine granular copper deposits in the cornea) in a young adult is highly suggestive of Wilson's disease, also called hepatolenticular degeneration.\nWilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disease most often identified in younger individuals aged 5 to 40 years. The genetic mutations associated with Wilson's disease hinder copper metabolism by reducing the formation and secretion of ceruloplasmin and by decreasing the secretion of copper into the biliary system.\nCopper is a pro-oxidant, and as it accumulates in greater quantities within the liver, it causes damage to the hepatic tissue through the generation of free radicals. Eventually copper leaks from injured hepatocytes into the blood to be deposited in various tissues, including the basal ganglia (hepatolenticular degeneration) and cornea.\nLiver involvement in Wilson's disease may present as asymptomatic liver function abnormalities, chronic hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, portal hypertension, or macronodular cirrhosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can include Parkinsonian-like tremor, rigidity, ataxia, slurred speech, drooling, personality changes, depression, paranoia, and catatonia. Wilson's disease is also associated with Fanconi syndrome, hemolytic anemia, and neuropathy. The gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy that demonstrates a quantitative hepatic copper level =250 mcg/gram dry weight. More commonly, diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of low serum ceruloplasmin (particularly <20 mg/dL) in conjunction with increased urinary copper excretion or Kayser-Fleischer rings.\nTreatment must be adhered to for the patient's lifetime and focuses on removing accumulated copper in the tissues and preventing re-accumulation. First-line medications include copper chelators like d-penicillamine or trientine. Oral zinc is also recommended as it prevents copper absorption. Liver transplantation may be the only option for those with fulminant hepatic failure or decompensated liver disease that does not respond to pharmacotherapy.\n(Choice A) Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by abnormally high iron absorption that results in iron overload. Common clinical manifestations include liver disease, hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus (\"bronze diabetes\"), impotence, arthropathy, and cardiac enlargement.\n(Choice C) While viral hepatitis can eventually cause cirrhosis of the liver, acute viral hepatitis is not associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms or the Kayser-Fleischer ring. Moreover, serum transaminases are typically much higher in patients diagnosed with viral hepatitis.\n(Choice D) Alcoholic hepatitis is typically associated with a more significant drinking history and is commonly characterized by an AST:ALT ratio greater than 2:1. The Kayser-Fleischer ring is not associated with alcoholic hepatitis.\nEducational Objective:\nWilson's disease is the likely diagnosis in a patient younger than 30 years old with unexplained chronic hepatitis. The presence of low serum ceruloplasmin and increased urinary copper excretion or Kayser-Fleischer rings confirms the diagnosis."

    "explanation": "This child is suffering from Reye syndrome, a condition also known as fatty liver with encephalopathy. Its seen exclusively in children younger than 15 years of age, and is preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection with influenza or varicella in 60-80% of all cases. Treatment with salicylates significantly increases the likelihood of developing Reye syndrome. Aspirin is therefore generally contraindicated in children, except in the treatment of Kawasaki disease.\nPathophysiologically, Reye syndrome is characterized by diffuse mitochondrial injury that leads to nausea, vomiting, headache, excitability, delirium, combativeness, hypoglycemia, liver failure, and progressive CNS damage. Histologically, extensive fatty vacuolization of the liver without inflammation is present. The liver is enlarged but there is no icterus. Important laboratory findings include elevated serum aminotransferases, elevated ammonia levels, PT prolongation, hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The mortality rate is approximately 30-35%. Treatment consists of administration of glucose with FFP and mannitol to decrease cerebral edema.\n(Choice A) Balloon degeneration with polymorphic cellular infiltrates is seen in the livers of those with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The accumulation of fat, protein, and water within the hepatocytes causes cellular swelling and eventually results in necrosis. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages pervade the parenchyma.\n(Choice B) Panlobular mononuclear infiltration with hepatic cell necrosis is observed in the livers of those with acute viral hepatitis. As the specialized macrophages of the liver, Kupffer cells phagocytose hepatocellular debris. Confluent hepatic cell necrosis connects adjacent lobules, a phenomenon described as \"bridging necrosis.\"\n(Choice D) Chronic active hepatitis is characterized by mononuclear inflammatory cells that extend from portal areas to disrupt the limiting periportal plate of hepatocytes undergoing necrosis, a phenomenon described as \"piecemeal\" necrosis. Eventually periportal septal fibrosis develops, followed by the connection of fibrous septa between lobules (\"bridging fibrosis\").\n(Choice E) Primary biliary cirrhosis results in a heavy lymphocytic infiltrate in the portal tracts that is associated with an inflammatory, granulomatous destruction of the small and medium intrahepatic biliary ducts.\nEducational Objective:\nPredominantly found in children who were given aspirin for virus-induced fever, Reye syndrome can lead to fulminant hepatic failure. Elevation of ammonia levels and transaminases, vomiting, and mental status changes are the more common clinical manifestations of this syndrome."

    "explanation": "In the United States, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. It typically presents late and has a poor prognosis, even in those with a potentially resectable mass. The five-year survival rate ranges from 10-30%, depending on nodal status. Incidence is higher in men and in blacks, with the disease developing most often after the age of 45. Major risk factors include chronic pancreatitis, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hereditary predisposition.\nPancreatic carcinoma most commonly presents with a dull upper abdominal pain that radiates to the back, weight loss, or jaundice. Those tumors located in the pancreatic body or tail are most likely to present with an abdominal mass or ascites present in only 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Classic findings include a nontender but palpable gallbladder at the right costal margin in a jaundiced patient (Courvoisier sign) or left supraclavicular adenopathy (Virchow’s node) in a patient with metastatic disease.\nLaboratory evaluation of those with pancreatic cancer typically demonstrates increased serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase in conjunction with a mild anemia.\nAbdominal ultrasound is usually the initial imaging performed on patients with jaundice. When the ultrasound is nondiagnostic (as in this case), the next step is to obtain an abdominal CT scan. This imaging modality has a sensitivity and specificity of 85-90% and 90-95% respectively, for the imaging of pancreatic cancer. Commonly, CT scan is effective in detecting bile and pancreatic duct dilation, mass lesions within the pancreas, and indications of extrahepatic spread (eg, metastases or ascites).\n(Choice B) Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) is an excellent tool in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, with a sensitivity and specificity of 90-95%. Because it is an invasive procedure, however, it is most commonly reserved for those patients who have already undergone a nondiagnostic ultrasound and a nondiagnostic CT scan.\n(Choice C) Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) is an invasive procedure in which a needle is inserted into a dilated bile duct and contrast material is injected for bile duct opacification. PTC is used in the evaluation of patients who have previously identified biliary tract dilation but are not candidates for ERCP. PTC also allows for certain therapeutic interventions, including the drainage of infected bile (in patients with cholangitis), extraction of stones in the biliary tract, dilation of benign biliary strictures, or stent placement across malignant strictures.\n(Choice D) Serum amylase and lipase are appropriate to obtain in patients with suspected pancreatitis. They are not helpful in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma.\n(Choice E) The most commonly used tumor marker for pancreatic cancer is the cancer associated antigen (CA) 19-9, which has a sensitivity and specificity of 80-80%. CA 19-3 can be elevated in patients with jaundice but no pancreatic cancer, however, which reduces its utility as a screening tool. Postoperative monitoring of pancreatic cancer with CA 199 may be helpful in evaluating the tumor response to chemotherapy.\nEducational Objective:\nAbdominal CT scan is a very sensitive and specific tool used in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma."

    "question": "A 52-year-old male comes to your office complaining of inability to achieve erection over the last year. He\nnates a recent unintended weight loss of about fifteen pounds over the past several months as well. Physical\nexamination reveals right-sided gynecomastia. His testes are firm and small. Laboratory testing shows\ndecreased levels of TSH, T4 and T3. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A Hashimoto disease",
      "B. Chronic liver disease",
      "C. Adrenal insufficiency",
      "D. Thyroxine consumption",
      "E. Pancreatic insufficiency"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease including weight loss, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy and impotence. The latter three symptoms are caused by the hyperestrogenemia that occurs in chronic liver disease, as estrogens are not adequately cleared from the blood due to increased portosystemic shunting and decreased synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin. Other findings in cirrhosis that are the result of estrogen excess include telangiectasias and palmar erythema. The decreases in TSH, T4 and T3 suggest hypothyroidism due to primary failure of the pituitary to appropriately secrete TSH in response to law T4 levels. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction can occur in patients with cirrhosis.\n(Choice A) Hashimoto disease is an autoimmune thyroiditis wherein lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid leads to hypothyroidism. Laboratory studies show an elevated TSH, decreased T4 and presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies.\n(Choice C) Adrenal insufficiency may be associated with weight loss, anxiety and decreased body hair among other symptoms. Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency may occur in association with autoimmune thyroiditis and testicular failure, but in this setting both the testes and the adrenal would be destroyed. Without a major source of estrogens, clinical hyperestrogenism would be unlikely.\n(Choice D) Increased thyroxine consumption would most likely be accompanied by a decreased TSH and high T4.\n(Choice E) Pancreatic insufficiency would lead to malabsorption due to exocrine dysfunction and diabetes if endocrine function was also impaired.\nEducational objective:\nChronic liver disease causes hyperestrogenism as a result of decreased clearance of estrogen from the blood by the liver due to increased portosystemic shunting. Additionally, decreased sex hormone binding globulin synthesis by the diseased liver increases the ability of circulating estrogen to exert its biologic effects. Symptoms of hyperestrogenemia include telangiectasias, palmar erythema, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia and impotence."

      "E. Primary biliane cirrhincic"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a functional disorder of bile formation that develops in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The condition is characterized by intense pruritus and increased serum bile acid concentrations. Incidence ranges from 0.2-4% and is highest among those individuals from Bolivia or Chile. The etiology is unclear, but it is thought that genetic and hormonal factors (eg, higher levels of estrogen or progesterone) influence the development of ICP.\nClinical manifestations of ICP include intense, often intolerable generalized pruritus that is especially significant on the palms and soles and worsens at night. Evidence of skin excoriations may be present.\nTreatment is based upon symptom relief and preventing complications in the mother and fetus. Ursodeoxycholic acid is most promising, as it increases bile flow and can relieve pruritus. Hydroxyzine and cholestyramine are alternative therapies, though they appear to be less effective and can have concerning side effects.\nThe maternal prognosis of those with ICP is good, as the condition resolves shortly after delivery. There are no hepatic sequelae. ICP may recur in subsequent pregnancies, and affected women are also at increased risk of developing gallstones.\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy poses more danger to the fetus than to the mother, as fetal prematurity, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and intrauterine demise are all known complications. Therefore, the preferred approach in managing the pregnancies of women with ICP includes an early delivery once fetal lung maturity is established.\n(Choice A) Normal physiological changes of pregnancy include a mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase (due to placental secretion of the enzyme) but normal bilirubin, aminotransferases, and GGT.\n(Choice C) Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a complication of the third trimester of pregnancy. Patients are sometimes asymptomatic, but may also complain of severe nausea, malaise, headache, and abdominal pain. Over half of patients also have preeclampsia, and 60% will develop acute renal failure. This condition can also cause a prolonged prothrombin time and moderate to severe elevation of transaminase levels. Histologically, acute fatty liver of pregnancy is characterized by microvesicular fat deposition in the hepatocytes without evidence of inflammation or necrosis.\n(Choice D) Primary sclerosing cholangitis is more commonly seen in patients with ulcerative colitis and presents with jaundice, pruritus, and right upper quadrant pain.\n(Choice E) Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol levels in conjunction with intense pruritus.\nEducational Objective:\nJaundice in the third trimester of pregnancy should be evaluated specifically for those hepatic disorders associated with pregnancy. Marked pruritus and elevated of total bile acids are suggestive of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy."

The three major pathological stages of alcoholic liver disease are: 1) Fatty liver (steatosis) 2) Alcoholic hepatitis and 3) Alcoholic fibrosis/cirrhosis. Fatty liver is the result of short term alcohol ingestion, whereas hepatitis and cirrhosis require long term, sustained alcohol use.

    "explanation": "This child is suffering from Reye syndrome, a condition also known as fatty liver with encephalopathy. Its seen exclusively in children younger than 15 years of age, and is preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection with influenza or varicella in 60-80% of all cases. Treatment with salicylates significantly increases the likelihood of developing Reye syndrome. Aspirin is therefore generally contraindicated in children, except in the treatment of Kawasaki disease.\nPathophysiologically, Reye syndrome is characterized by diffuse mitochondrial injury that leads to nausea, vomiting, headache, excitability, delirium, combativeness, hypoglycemia, liver failure, and progressive CNS damage. Histologically, extensive fatty vacuolization of the liver without inflammation is present. The liver is enlarged but there is no icterus. Important laboratory findings include elevated serum aminotransferases, elevated ammonia levels, PT prolongation, hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The mortality rate is approximately 30-35%. Treatment consists of administration of glucose with FFP and mannitol to decrease cerebral edema.\n(Choice A) Balloon degeneration with polymorphic cellular infiltrates is seen in the livers of those with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The accumulation of fat, protein, and water within the hepatocytes causes cellular swelling and eventually results in necrosis. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages pervade the parenchyma.\n(Choice B) Panlobular mononuclear infiltration with hepatic cell necrosis is observed in the livers of those with acute viral hepatitis. As the specialized macrophages of the liver, Kupffer cells phagocytose hepatocellular debris. Confluent hepatic cell necrosis connects adjacent lobules, a phenomenon described as \"bridging necrosis.\"\n(Choice D) Chronic active hepatitis is characterized by mononuclear inflammatory cells that extend from portal areas to disrupt the limiting periportal plate of hepatocytes undergoing necrosis, a phenomenon described as \"piecemeal\" necrosis. Eventually periportal septal fibrosis develops, followed by the connection of fibrous septa between lobules (\"bridging fibrosis\").\n(Choice E) Primary biliary cirrhosis results in a heavy lymphocytic infiltrate in the portal tracts that is associated with an inflammatory, granulomatous destruction of the small and medium intrahepatic biliary ducts.\nEducational Objective:\nPredominantly found in children who were given aspirin for virus-induced fever, Reye syndrome can lead to fulminant hepatic failure. Elevation of ammonia levels and transaminases, vomiting, and mental status changes are the more common clinical manifestations of this syndrome."

    "explanation": "This child is suffering from Reye syndrome, a condition also known as fatty liver with encephalopathy. Its seen exclusively in children younger than 15 years of age, and is preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection with influenza or varicella in 60-80% of all cases. Treatment with salicylates significantly increases the likelihood of developing Reye syndrome. Aspirin is therefore generally contraindicated in children, except in the treatment of Kawasaki disease.\nPathophysiologically, Reye syndrome is characterized by diffuse mitochondrial injury that leads to nausea, vomiting, headache, excitability, delirium, combativeness, hypoglycemia, liver failure, and progressive CNS damage. Histologically, extensive fatty vacuolization of the liver without inflammation is present. The liver is enlarged but there is no icterus. Important laboratory findings include elevated serum aminotransferases, elevated ammonia levels, PT prolongation, hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The mortality rate is approximately 30-35%. Treatment consists of administration of glucose with FFP and mannitol to decrease cerebral edema.\n(Choice A) Balloon degeneration with polymorphic cellular infiltrates is seen in the livers of those with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The accumulation of fat, protein, and water within the hepatocytes causes cellular swelling and eventually results in necrosis. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages pervade the parenchyma.\n(Choice B) Panlobular mononuclear infiltration with hepatic cell necrosis is observed in the livers of those with acute viral hepatitis. As the specialized macrophages of the liver, Kupffer cells phagocytose hepatocellular debris. Confluent hepatic cell necrosis connects adjacent lobules, a phenomenon described as \"bridging necrosis.\"\n(Choice D) Chronic active hepatitis is characterized by mononuclear inflammatory cells that extend from portal areas to disrupt the limiting periportal plate of hepatocytes undergoing necrosis, a phenomenon described as \"piecemeal\" necrosis. Eventually periportal septal fibrosis develops, followed by the connection of fibrous septa between lobules (\"bridging fibrosis\").\n(Choice E) Primary biliary cirrhosis results in a heavy lymphocytic infiltrate in the portal tracts that is associated with an inflammatory, granulomatous destruction of the small and medium intrahepatic biliary ducts.\nEducational Objective:\nPredominantly found in children who were given aspirin for virus-induced fever, Reye syndrome can lead to fulminant hepatic failure. Elevation of ammonia levels and transaminases, vomiting, and mental status changes are the more common clinical manifestations of this syndrome."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a functional disorder of bile formation that develops in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The condition is characterized by intense pruritus and increased serum bile acid concentrations. Incidence ranges from 0.2-4% and is highest among those individuals from Bolivia or Chile. The etiology is unclear, but it is thought that genetic and hormonal factors (eg, higher levels of estrogen or progesterone) influence the development of ICP.\nClinical manifestations of ICP include intense, often intolerable generalized pruritus that is especially significant on the palms and soles and worsens at night. Evidence of skin excoriations may be present.\nTreatment is based upon symptom relief and preventing complications in the mother and fetus. Ursodeoxycholic acid is most promising, as it increases bile flow and can relieve pruritus. Hydroxyzine and cholestyramine are alternative therapies, though they appear to be less effective and can have concerning side effects.\nThe maternal prognosis of those with ICP is good, as the condition resolves shortly after delivery. There are no hepatic sequelae. ICP may recur in subsequent pregnancies, and affected women are also at increased risk of developing gallstones.\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy poses more danger to the fetus than to the mother, as fetal prematurity, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and intrauterine demise are all known complications. Therefore, the preferred approach in managing the pregnancies of women with ICP includes an early delivery once fetal lung maturity is established.\n(Choice A) Normal physiological changes of pregnancy include a mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase (due to placental secretion of the enzyme) but normal bilirubin, aminotransferases, and GGT.\n(Choice C) Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a complication of the third trimester of pregnancy. Patients are sometimes asymptomatic, but may also complain of severe nausea, malaise, headache, and abdominal pain. Over half of patients also have preeclampsia, and 60% will develop acute renal failure. This condition can also cause a prolonged prothrombin time and moderate to severe elevation of transaminase levels. Histologically, acute fatty liver of pregnancy is characterized by microvesicular fat deposition in the hepatocytes without evidence of inflammation or necrosis.\n(Choice D) Primary sclerosing cholangitis is more commonly seen in patients with ulcerative colitis and presents with jaundice, pruritus, and right upper quadrant pain.\n(Choice E) Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol levels in conjunction with intense pruritus.\nEducational Objective:\nJaundice in the third trimester of pregnancy should be evaluated specifically for those hepatic disorders associated with pregnancy. Marked pruritus and elevated of total bile acids are suggestive of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy."

      "D. Presence of hepatitis B care antigen in serum"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Chronic hepatitis is a syndrome defined by hepatic injury that persists for at least six months, and can result from a broad spectrum of liver disorders that vary in cause and severity. In this patient, the persistence of HBsAg in the serum for a period of seven months confirms the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B infection. Historically, chronic hepatitis was separated into two different histologic categories: \"chronic active hepatitis\" (associated with active liver destruction) and \"chronic persistent hepatitis” (associated with no active liver destruction). These terms have largely been replaced with new terminology that grades the severity of liver disease and stages the progression of fibrosis. While the best means of evaluating liver damage in acute hepatitis includes liver function tests and viral serology, the best means of evaluating liver damage in chronic hepatitis is via liver biopsy. Therefore, a liver biopsy would be the best means of determining this patient's current hepatic function.\n(Choice A) Chronic active hepatitis can be associated with extrahepatic complications (eg, arthritis). However, this is not a consistent finding and cannot be used as a reliable means of evaluating liver functionality.\n(Choice C) The relative levels of hepatic enzymes vary considerably in chronic hepatitis and are therefore of limited value. However, they provide important insight into liver functionality in patients with acute hepatitis.\n(Choice D) The presence of hepatitis B core antigen in serum is not an accurate marker for disease severity in patients with chronic hepatitis.\n(Choice E) Ultrasound is not particularly useful in the evaluation of chronic hepatitis.\nEducational Objective:\nThe evaluation of liver damage in patients with acute hepatitis is based upon liver function tests and viral serology. In contrast, the evaluation of liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis is based upon liver biopsy."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Produced primarily in the liver, alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is a serum protein that inhibits several different proteolytic enzymes (eg, pancreatic trypsin, chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase). It is also an acute-phase reactant that plays a significant role in inflammatory states. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is coded for by a single, highly pleomorphic gene on chromosome 14. There is considerable variation in the expression of this gene, with phenotypic results ranging from mild to severe protein deficiency. Those individuals who are homozygous and severely deficient in A1AT are most often of northern European heritage, comprising 0.02% of the white population in the United States. Heterozygotes comprise another 2-3% of the white population in the United States. Histologically, the granules evident in the hepatocytes of afflicted individuals are thought to represent the accumulation of A1AT and other proteins.\nClinical manifestations of A1AT deficiency are related to lung or liver disease. Individuals with severe deficiencies often develop panacinar emphysema. Smokers with the condition tend to develop dyspnea at a median age of 40 years versus a median age of 53 years in nonsmokers with the condition. Other common pulmonary complications include chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, but emphysema remains the most common cause of death.\nLiver disease also develops in 12-16% of homozygous individuals and is of the greatest concern in the first two decades of life. Those affected typically demonstrate hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly, cholestasis, and elevation of the hepatocellular enzymes. However it is not uncommon for patients to be asymptomatic until they have developed end-stage liver disease. The most severe consequences of liver involvement include cirrhosis (which is the second most common cause of death in this population) and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThe diagnosis of A1AT deficiency is established by measurement of the serum A1AT level, followed by confirmatory genetic testing. This testing is indicated in all patients with premature onset of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and dyspnea, as well as in nonsmokers suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nTreatment options include augmentation therapy with purified human A1AT for those with severe deficiencies. Individuals suffering from severe pulmonary impairment are candidates for lung transplants, while those in hepatic failure can be treated with liver transplantation.\n(Choice A) Wilson's disease is an unusual genetic disorder that results in the excessive accumulation of copper in tissue, which can cause hepatic injury. It is not a common cause of cirrhosis.\n(Choice B) Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that results in the excessive accumulation of iron in tissue, which can cause hepatic injury. It is not a common cause of cirrhosis.\n(Choice C) Bronchogenic carcinoma is unlikely in a non-smoking patient of this age. Moreover, the carcinomatous cells would not contain PAS-positive granules.\n(Choice E) Hodgkin's disease can cause infiltrative disease of the liver, but a biopsy would normally reveal Reed-Sternberg cells.\n(Choice F) Whipple's disease is caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whippelii and typically affects the bowel, causing malabsorption. It is not associated with cirrhosis.\nEducational Objective:\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with panacinar emphysema and cirrhosis."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Produced primarily in the liver, alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is a serum protein that inhibits several different proteolytic enzymes (eg, pancreatic trypsin, chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase). It is also an acute-phase reactant that plays a significant role in inflammatory states. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is coded for by a single, highly pleomorphic gene on chromosome 14. There is considerable variation in the expression of this gene, with phenotypic results ranging from mild to severe protein deficiency. Those individuals who are homozygous and severely deficient in A1AT are most often of northern European heritage, comprising 0.02% of the white population in the United States. Heterozygotes comprise another 2-3% of the white population in the United States. Histologically, the granules evident in the hepatocytes of afflicted individuals are thought to represent the accumulation of A1AT and other proteins.\nClinical manifestations of A1AT deficiency are related to lung or liver disease. Individuals with severe deficiencies often develop panacinar emphysema. Smokers with the condition tend to develop dyspnea at a median age of 40 years versus a median age of 53 years in nonsmokers with the condition. Other common pulmonary complications include chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, but emphysema remains the most common cause of death.\nLiver disease also develops in 12-16% of homozygous individuals and is of the greatest concern in the first two decades of life. Those affected typically demonstrate hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly, cholestasis, and elevation of the hepatocellular enzymes. However it is not uncommon for patients to be asymptomatic until they have developed end-stage liver disease. The most severe consequences of liver involvement include cirrhosis (which is the second most common cause of death in this population) and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThe diagnosis of A1AT deficiency is established by measurement of the serum A1AT level, followed by confirmatory genetic testing. This testing is indicated in all patients with premature onset of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and dyspnea, as well as in nonsmokers suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nTreatment options include augmentation therapy with purified human A1AT for those with severe deficiencies. Individuals suffering from severe pulmonary impairment are candidates for lung transplants, while those in hepatic failure can be treated with liver transplantation.\n(Choice A) Wilson's disease is an unusual genetic disorder that results in the excessive accumulation of copper in tissue, which can cause hepatic injury. It is not a common cause of cirrhosis.\n(Choice B) Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that results in the excessive accumulation of iron in tissue, which can cause hepatic injury. It is not a common cause of cirrhosis.\n(Choice C) Bronchogenic carcinoma is unlikely in a non-smoking patient of this age. Moreover, the carcinomatous cells would not contain PAS-positive granules.\n(Choice E) Hodgkin's disease can cause infiltrative disease of the liver, but a biopsy would normally reveal Reed-Sternberg cells.\n(Choice F) Whipple's disease is caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whippelii and typically affects the bowel, causing malabsorption. It is not associated with cirrhosis.\nEducational Objective:\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with panacinar emphysema and cirrhosis."

    "question": "A 56-year-old white male wha is experiencing massive hematemesis is brought to the emergency\ndepartment by a friend who says that this has never happened before. The patient has a history of peptic\nulcer disease and esophageal varices secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis. His current medications include\npropranolol, omeprazole, and spironolactone. Vital signs include temperature of 37 6C (99 6F), blood\npressure of 102/58 mm Hg, pulse of 112/min, and respirations of 23/min. The man is in acute distress.\nWhich of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Administer octreotide",
      "B. Perform endoscopic band ligation of varices",
      "C. Perform endoscopic sclerotherapy",
      "D. Insert twa large bare intravenous needles",
      "E. Place a Sengstaken-Blakemaore (S.B.) tube"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Variceal bleeding is a life-threatening emergency, as the loss of blood can be sudden and dramatic. Therefore, prompt and aggressive fluid resuscitation should be the first step in the management of this patient. All patients with acute hemorrhage should have vascular access established immediately. Two large bore intravenous needles or a central line should be placed and fluid resuscitation undertaken until any necessary blood products can be transfused. To minimize the risk of aspiration, the airway should be protected and gastric decompression initiated with nasogastric aspiration.\nThe second step in the management of variceal bleeding is to control the bleeding itself. In approximately 50% of cases, the bleeding ceases on its own without further intervention. Medical control of bleeding may be accomplished by administering vasoconstrictors like terlipressin (a synthetic analogue of vasopressin), octreotide, or somatostatin. The control of bleeding is established in 80% of these patients, though rebleeding is very common (especially in the six weeks following the initial hemorrhage).\n(Choice A) Octreotide is a reasonable option in the medical management of variceal bleeding. It is thought to be most effective when used in conjunction with endoscopic therapy. Obtaining intravenous access should be the first priority, however.\n(Choices B and C) Endoscopic sclerotherapy has been used frequently over the past two decades for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding and has been successful in controlling the bleeding in 90% of cases. Many experts prefer sclerotherapy to band ligation when bleeding is significant and the field of vision obscured, as sclerotherapy is faster and allows for better visualization while still achieving hemostasis as effectively as band ligation. For the elective endoscopic treatment of varices, however, band ligation is often employed.\n(Choice E) Balloon tamponade with the Sengstaken-Blakemore, Minnesota, or Linton-Nachlas tubes can be employed for the short-term control of bleeding when endoscopy is unavailable or when medications are not taking effect quickly enough. This method is most often used to temporarily alleviate symptoms until the patient can be transferred to a tertiary care hospital, and is not considered first-line treatment. Surgical treatment (eg, shunt operations, esophageal transaction, or devascularization of the gastroesophageal junction) or the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) are options for patients who have failed medical or endoscopic therapy.\nEducational Objective:\nThe first step in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding is to establish vascular access with two large bore intravenous needles or a central line."

    "question": "A 52-year-old patient comes to ER with severe vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. On examination he has\nepigastric tenderness and xanthomas.

His past medical history is insignificant except far an\nelective chalecystectomy 8 years ago for recurrent abdominal pain. He says that his father had a lipid\ndisorder and died of a heart attack VWhat is the most likely cause of pancreatitis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gall stone pancreatitis",
      "B. Drug induced pancreatitis",
      "C. Hypertriglyceridemia",
      "D. Alcohol induced",
      "E. Idiopathic"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Acute pancreatitis is most commonly secondary to gallstones or alcohol abuse. However, it may be also secondary to drug toxicity, idiopathic etiology, hypertriglyceridemia, infection, severe trauma or burns, hypercalcemia, pancreatic abnormality, tumors, toxins or due to post operative or post ERCP etiology.\nThis patient is not a big time alcoholic and had his gallbladder removed long time ago so thus the two most common causes are unlikely. However, he has markedly elevated triglyceride levels, along with a positive family history of early cardiovascular disease and xanthomas making the hypertriglyceridemia the most likely cause of his pancreatitis. Triglyceride levels = 1000 mg/dl is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis and during the attack the triglyceride levels can be as high as 3000-5000 mg/dl. Though acute pancreatitis itself can cause an increase in triglycerides it is usually not so high. Hyperlipidemia types 1 and 5 are associated with acute pancreatitis (Choice C). Acute pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia often has normal levels of amylase.\n(Choice A) The patient had his gallbladder removed 8 years ago. Also, in patients with pancreatitis due to gallstone the alkaline phosphatase is more than 150 IU/L.\n(Choice B) NSAIDs in general do not cause acute pancreatitis. Some important drugs causing acute pancreatitis are azathioprine, sulfonamides, sulindac, tetracycline, valproic acid, didanosine, methyldopa, estrogens, furosemide, 6-mercaptopurine, pentamidine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, and octreotide.\n(Choice D) This patient drinks alcohol only occasionally and it usually takes more than that to cause acute pancreatitis.\n(Choice E) Idiopathic pancreatitis is seen in about 10% of cases, however the diagnosis is made only after other causes have been ruled out.\nEducational Objective:\nHypertriglyceridemia = 1000mg/dl can cause acute pancreatitis."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are distributed widely throughout the body, with AST present and very active in the liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. While ALT is also present in reduced quantities in the kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle, it is predominantly found in the liver and is therefore more specific for hepatocyte injury.\nThe patient in this scenario has a mild (<= 250 U/L), asymptomatic elevation of his serum transaminases. The first step in the evaluation of his condition should be a careful screening for all hepatitis risk factors, including drug and alcohol intake, travel outside the United States, blood transfusions, or high-risk sexual practices. This aspect of the patient's history will provide insight as to whether the transaminase elevation could be caused by alcohol, medications (eg, NSAIDs, antibiotics, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, antiepileptic drugs, antituberculous drugs, herbal preparations), or viral agents.\nAfter thoroughly questioning the patient about his history and having him discontinue all alcohol and drug use, the next step in the evaluation process would be to repeat the liver function tests. If the transaminases persist in being elevated over a six-month period, they are categorized as chronic. Testing for viral hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, and fatty liver should then be undertaken to further evaluate chronically elevated transaminases. If these tests prove unremarkable, a search for muscle disorders (eg, polymyositis, seizures, heavy exercise) and thyroid disease should be made. Still less common causes of aminotransferase elevations include occult celiac disease and adrenal insufficiency.\n(Choice A) This patient has no obvious risk factors for viral hepatitis. Therefore, his drug and alcohol usage must be examined first.\n(Choice C) An ultrasound of the abdomen would not be particularly enlightening in a patient with asymptomatic aminotransferase elevation unless gallbladder pathology was suspected.\n(Choice D) These tests are employed to rule out Wilson's disease, which is not a likely diagnosis in an asymptomatic middle-aged man with an unremarkable history and physical exam. However, these tests could be ordered after all common causes of hepatitis were ruled out.\n(Choice E) These tests are employed to rule out hemochromatosis, which is a possible diagnosis in an asymptomatic middle-aged man with a normal physical exam. However, the more common causes of hepatitis should be ruled out before testing for the more unusual causes.\nEducational Objective:\nIn evaluating the asymptomatic evaluation of aminotransferases, the first step is to take a thorough history to rule out the more common hepatitis risk factors (eg, alcohol or drug use, travel outside of the country, blood transfusions, high-risk sexual practices)."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has acute ascending cholangitis, which is characterized by Charcot's triad of fever, severe jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Confusion and hypotension may also be observed in those with suppurative cholangitis, producing Reynold's pentad.\nAn infection of the common bile duct, cholangitis most commonly arises secondary to obstruction of the common bile duct by stone or stricture. Laboratory findings include leukocytosis and liver function test abnormalities that are suggestive of cholestasis. Ultrasound is typically the first imaging study employed to confirm the diagnosis. As cholangitis is an acute condition, the immediate provision of supportive care and broad-spectrum antibiotics is required. In 80% of patients, this course of treatment is sufficient. However, some patients continue to have persistent abdominal pain, hypotension despite adequate fluids, high fever, or mental confusion. These signs and symptoms are indications for urgent biliary decompression, preferably by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is minimally invasive, has a low rate of complications, and allows for diagnostic confirmation. Therapeutic intervention typically includes sphincterotomy with stone removal and/or stent insertion. Early drainage of the biliary tree in acute cholangitis can significantly decrease its morbidity and mortality.\n(Choice B) Surgical decompression is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is no longer the preferred form of treatment.\n(Choice C) If nonsurgical drainage procedures fail to relieve the biliary compression, choledochotomy with placement of a large-bore T tube is appropriate.\n(Choice D) Transhepatic cholangiopancreatography is an alternative treatment option when ERCP is unavailable or contraindicated.\n(Choice E) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy will not accomplish drainage of the biliary tree, which is the immediate concern. Although this patient should eventually undergo a cholecystectomy, the drainage of the biliary tree is more important at this time.\nEducational Objective:\nThe treatment of acute cholangitis includes provision of supportive care and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who do not respond to this treatment regimen should undergo biliary drainage with an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography."

    "question": "A 45-year-old female presents to clinic complaining of a six-manth histary of recurrent right upper abdominal\npain after meals. She is obese and takes anti-hypertensive medication. Vital signs are stable. There is no\nabdominal tenderness to palpation, rebound, ar guarding. Abdominal radiograph is normal, but an ultrasound\naf the abdomen reveals three gallstones, with the largest measuring 8 mm in diameter. She is advised to\nundergo an elective cholecystectomy but she expresses great reluctance to have the surgery. Which of the\nfollowing is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Provide her with analgesics and send her home",
      "B. Advise her to avoid fatty foods and send her home",
      "C. Provide her with ursodeoxycholic acid and advise her to avoid fatty foods",
      "D. Refer her for weight reduction",
      "E. Inform her that there are no other options at this time"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This woman's presentation is classical for gallstone disease (cholelithiasis), which is most common in those who are \"fat, fertile, female, and forty.\" Native American heritage, diabetes mellitus, obesity, rapid weight loss, and the usage of oral contraceptives all predispose to gallstone formation. Typically, patients will complain of bloating and dyspepsia after eating fatty foods. Occasional right upper quadrant abdominal pain is common.\nThe diagnosis of cholelithiasis is best confirmed with abdominal ultrasound. Once diagnosed, the treatment of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Those patients who prefer not to undergo cholecystectomy may be given a bile salt such as ursodeoxycholic acid, which decreases the cholesterol content of the bile by reducing the hepatic secretion and intestinal reabsorption of cholesterol. This medication is expensive however, and therapy may be necessary for several months before the gallstones dissolve. In addition, gallstones recur in 50% of patients once the treatment is stopped.\n(Choice A) As patients with symptomatic gallstones experience a high rate of complications, it would be inappropriate to provide this woman with analgesics but no definitive therapy for her condition.\n(Choice B) It is indeed important that this woman be advised to avoid fatty foods so that her symptoms can be better managed. However, dietary measures will not reverse or dissolve her gallstones and are therefore not sufficient to prevent further complications.\n(Choice D) Obesity is a risk factor for gallstone disease and should be corrected to reduce the likelihood of worsening or recurrent disease. However, weight loss will not be of benefit in the dissolution of already present gallstones, and as such is not a sufficient measure in treating symptomatic patients.\n(Choice E) Failing to take action in managing a patient with symptomatic gallstones is entirely inappropriate as there are multiple therapeutic options available.\nEducational Objective:\nUrsodeoxycholic acid is a medication used to dissolve small radiolucent gallstones in patients with normal, functional gallbladders who are poor surgical candidates. However, this medication is very costly and associated with a high risk of relapse when therapy is halted."

      "D. Liver fibrosis",
      "E. Bane remodeling",
      "F. Bone demineralization"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has an elevated alkaline phosphatase level in the setting of a normal GGT, suggesting that the cause is probably bone rather than liver pathology. His hearing loss raises concern for Paget's disease of the bone. Paget's disease is characterized by high bone turnover and aberrant osteoid formation and occurs in up to 2% of the elderly in the United States. Often asymptomatic, Paget's may present with bone pain, headaches, and deafness depending upon the bones involved. As bones reshape they become soft and susceptible to fracture Laboratory findings consistent with Paget's disease include an elevated alkaline phosphatase but normal calcium, phosphorus, and other liver enzymes. X-rays will reveal dense, expanded bones. Treatment for Paget's disease of the bone consists of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates.\n(Choice B) Biliary tract obstruction typically causes right upper quadrant pain. Elevations in alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin are seen first, with transaminase elevation occurring in prolonged disease.\n(Choice C) Portal hypertension is typically due to cirrhosis. Labs may be consistent with hepatocellular damage (elevated AST and ALT), but are often normal early in the disease.\n(Choice D) Liver fibrosis is the pathologic finding in cirrhosis. In quiescent cirrhosis, a patient's bloodwork may be normal, but as the disease progresses, laboratory abnormalities reflective of hepatocellular injury and hyperbilirubinemia develop. This patient does not have labs or symptoms consistent with cirrhosis.\n(Choice F) Poor bone mineralization is the hallmark of osteoporosis. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and liver function tests are typically normal in osteoporosis. Osteoporosis due to hyperparathyroidism is accompanied by hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and a normal or elevated alkaline phosphatase.\nEducational objective:\nPaget's disease of the bone is characterized by increased bone remodeling and abnormal osteoid formation. It may be asymptomatic or accompanied by pain and deafness. Alkaline phosphatase will be elevated but serum calcium, phosphorus, and other liver function tests will be normal."

    "options": [
      "A. Acetaminophen toxicity",
      "B. Alcoholic liver disease",
      "C. Primary sclerosing cholangitis",

      "E. Total parenteral nutrition",
      "F. Chronic hepatitis B"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has vanishing bile duct syndrome, a rare disease involving progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The histological hallmark is ductopenia. The exact underlying pathophysiology is unknown. Primary biliary cirrhosis is the most common cause of ductopenia in adults. Other causes include failing liver transplantation, Hodgkin's disease, graft-versus-host disease, sarcoid, CMV infection, HIV, and medication toxicity.\n(Choice A) Acetaminophen toxicity causes centrilobular or diffuse necrosis, not loss of bile ducts.\n(Choice B) Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by hepatocyte swelling and necrosis, Mallory bodies, and neutrophilic infiltration. Ductopenia is not commonly found.\n(Choice C) The pathologic hallmarks of primary sclerosing cholangitis are periductal portal tract fibrosis and segmental stenosis of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts. Bile duct loss is not classically observed.\n(Choice E) Patients on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 2-3 weeks may develop cholestasis. This can progress into fibrosis if TPN is continued. Ductopenia is not a common finding.\n(Choice F) Liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis B will reveal hepatocellular injury, sinusoidal cell reactive changes, and inflammation and fibrosis of the portal tracts. Loss of bile ducts is not a hallmark finding.\nEducational objective:\nVanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare condition characterized by progressive ductopenia, or loss of intrahepatic bile ducts. The most common cause of ductopenia in adults is primary biliary cirrhosis."

      "C. Methadone",
      "E. High-calarie diet",
      "F. Subdural clot evacuation",
      "G. Nonabsorbable disaccharide"
    ],
    "answer": "G",
    "explanation": "This man has hepatic encephalopathy related to cirrhosis. Hepatic encephalopathy is a central nervous system disorder that results from the liver's inability to detoxify the body. Ammonia is a key causative agent but is not the sole agent responsible. Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy range from day-night reversal and mild confusion to coma. Precipitants include gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, dehydration, constipation, large protein loads, and sedating medications. On physical exam patients will have stigmata of cirrhosis and asterixis — a rhythmic flapping of the hands when extended at the wrists.\nThe treatments for hepatic encephalopathy are numerous. The first and most important step is to treat the underlying precipitant. Lactulose is also an essential component of the management of this condition. Lactulose is a nonabsorbable disaccharide syrup that is converted into fatty acids by colonic bacteria. It acidifies the colon, causing both catharsis and a decrease in circulating ammonia levels. Third, antibiotics may be used to decrease the number of ammonia-producing bacteria in the colon. The principal antibiotics used are neomycin and rifaximin. Finally, catharsis using any laxative may be of some benefit as well.\n(Choice A) Thiamine is the treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy, a thiamine deficiency disease. This patient does not have the Wernicke triad of altered mental status, ataxia, and nystagmus. Wernicke's does not cause asterixis. That said, all alcoholics should receive thiamine upon admission to the hospital.\n(Choice B) Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to treat narcotic overdose. Narcotics do not cause asterixis, and this patient's normal sized, reactive pupils are not consistent with opioid intoxication.\n(Choice C) Methadone is a long-acting narcotic that will be very difficult for this patient to metabolize. It should not be given in this situation.\n(Choice D) Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine used to treat alcohol withdrawal. Confusion is common in alcohol withdrawal but this patient does not have the autonomic instability characteristic of this disease. Benzodiazepines will be very sedating for this patient and should be avoided.\n(Choice E) A high-calorie diet is likely to be high in protein. A high-protein diet will increase this patient's nitrogen load and likely worsen his hepatic encephalopathy.\n(Choice F) A subdural hematoma results from traumatic tearing of the bridging veins. Most patients will complain of pain, confusion, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. It does not cause asterixis.\n(Choice H) Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to promote sodium excretion and maintain volume status in patients with cirrhosis. Furosemide will help manage this patient's ascites but will not treat his hepatic encephalopathy.\nEducational objective:\nHepatic encephalopathy is an alteration in CNS function due to poor hepatic clearance of toxins. There is typically a clear precipitant and symptoms may range from mild confusion to coma. Treatment includes lactulose, neomycin or rifaximin, and laxatives."

      "D. Emphysematous cholecystitis",
      "aE Acie ~halanatic"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Emphysematous cholecystitis is a form of acute cholecystitis that arises due to secondary infection of the gallbladder wall with gas-forming bacteria (eg, Clostridium, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella). Patients with this condition are typically males aged 50-70 years. Predisposing factors include vascular compromise (by obstruction or stenosis of the cystic artery, which is the sole arterial supply to the gallbladder), immunosuppression (as seen with diabetes mellitus), gallstones, and infection with gas-forming bacteria.\nClinical manifestations of emphysematous cholecystitis include right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. Crepitus in the abdominal wall adjacent to the gallbladder is occasionally detectable, but peritoneal signs are absent. Complications include gangrene and perforation. If perforation occurs, the abdominal pain is relieved but peritonitis results.\nDiagnosis is confirmed with an abdominal radiograph demonstrating air fluid levels in the gallbladder or an ultrasound showing curvilinear gas shadowing in the gallbladder. CT scan may be of help in confirming the diagnosis if other imaging modalities are unclear. Laboratory findings may include a mild to moderate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or a small elevation in aminotransferases.\nTreatment includes immediate fluid and electrolyte resuscitation, early cholecystectomy, and parenteral antibiotic therapy that is effective against the gram-positive anaerobic Clostridium sp. (ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, or the combination of an aminoglycoside or quinolone with clindamycin or metronidazole).\n(Choice A) Abdominal ultrasound would demonstrate gallstones in a patient with acute calculous cholecystitis. Moreover, air fluid levels or gas shadowing in the gallbladder would not be evident.\n(Choice B) Acute pancreatitis is most commonly associated with alcohol intake or gallstones, neither of which is present in this patient. Moreover air fluid levels or gas shadowing in the gallbladder would not be evident.\n(Choice C) Peptic ulcer perforation would be associated with free air under the diaphragm, not air fluid levels or gas shadowing in the gallbladder.\n(Choice E) Acute cholangitis is an infection of the biliary tract characterized by high fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain (Charcot's triad). The condition arises due to biliary tract obstruction and a resultant bacterial contamination of the bile. Common causes of biliary tract obstruction include choledocholithiasis, biliary tract manipulations/stenting, and hepatobiliary malignancies. Alkaline phosphatase and the white blood count are also often markedly elevated in this patient population.\nEducational Objective:\nEmphysematous cholecystitis is a common form of acute cholecystitis in elderly diabetic males It arises due to infection of the gallbladder wall with gas-forming bacteria."

    "options": [
      "A. Pyogenic liver abscess",
      "B. Amebic liver abscess",
      "C. Hydatid cyst",
      "D. Liver carcinoma",
      "E. Hepatic adenoma"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has an amebic liver abscess. The history of travel to an endemic area followed by dysentery and right upper quadrant pain with a single cyst in right lobe of liver is indicative of amebic liver abscess.\nAmebiasis is a protozoal disease caused by Entamoeba histolytica. The primary infection is in the colon leading to bloody diarrhea; however the ameba may be transported to the liver by portal circulation thus leading to an amebic liver abscess (Choice B).\nAmebic liver abscesses are generally single and are located usually in the right lobe. An abscess on the superior surface of liver can cause a pleuritic-like type of pain and the radiation to the shoulder. The diagnosis can be made by stool examination for trophozoites, serology, and liver imaging. The aspirate from the amebic liver abscess is usually sterile. Treatment is with metronidazole.\n(Choice A) Pyogenic liver abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis of amebic liver abscess, but this patient's history is more suggestive of amebic liver abscess. Pyogenic liver abscess is generally secondary to surgery, a gastrointestinal infection, or acute appendicitis. The condition of the patient would be more severe than in amebic liver abscess.\n(Choice C) A hydatid cyst is usually caused by an infection with Echinococcus granulosus, which is acquired by intimate contacts with dogs.\n(Choice D) Unilocular cystic lesion as a presentation of hepatic adenocarcinoma is not common. Cystic carcinoma generally has thick irregular and hyper vascular walls with numerous septa. The other inflammatory features are unlikely to be present with carcinoma.\n(Choice E) Hepatic adenoma is a solid lesion and not a cystic lesion.\nEducational Objective:\nEntamoeba histolytica is a protozoan, which can cause amebic liver abscess. Remember the Mexico trip."

    "explanation": "This patient has decompensated cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C as suggested by ascites, hematemesis, jaundice, gynecomastia, and spider angiomas. He then develops asterixis, confusion, and sleep cycle reversal suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy.\nHepatic encephalopathy is a central nervous system (CNS) complication of liver failure secondary to accumulation of ammonia in blood because of the inability of the liver to detoxify ammonia into urea (Choice A). However ammonia is not the only toxin responsible for encephalopathy. The pathogenic factors involved in the development of hepatic encephalopathy are:\n1. Accumulation of ammonia in blood.\n2 Production of false neurotransmitters.\n3. Increased sensitivity of the CNS to inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA.\n4. Zinc deficiency.\nSome of the precipitating factors for hepatic encephalopathy are:\n1. High protein diet.\n2 Alkalosis.\n3. Diuretic therapy.\n4. Extensive gastro intestinal bleeding.\n5. Narcotics, hypnotics, and sedatives.\n6. Medication containing ammonium or amino compounds.\n7. High volume paracentesis.\n8. Hepatic or systemic infection.\n9. Portocaval shunts.\nHepatic encephalopathy is characterized by reversal of sleep cycle, asterixis, progressive coma, and characteristic delta waves on electroencephalogram (EEG).\n(Choice B) Urea is the detoxified product of ammonia, which is produced by the liver through the urea cycle and excreted by the kidney.\n(Choice C) The liver is a major site of gluconeogenesis and liver failure can lead to hypoglycemia and coma but this patient's profile and development of symptoms after receiving a thiazide along with asterixis is suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy.\n(Choice D) Salt restricted diet is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis with ascites and has nothing to do with hepatic encephalopathy.\n(Choice E) Protein rich diet and not protein poor diet is a precipitating factor for encephalopathy as protein rich diet produces more ammonia in gut.\nEducational Objective:\nHepatic encephalopathy is a central nervous system complication of liver failure secondary to accumulation of ammonia in blood because of inability of liver to detoxify ammonia into urea."

      "B. Proctoscopy",
      "C. Serum ammonia levels",
      "E. Abdominal CT scan"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has signs and symptoms that are strongly suggestive of alcoholic cirrhosis (jaundice, spider angiomas, caput medusae, hepatosplenomegaly, ultrasonographic nodularity of the liver, ascites, and elevated liver enzymes). Portal hypertension is likely present, as indicated by the caput medusae and splenomegaly. Cirrhotic patients tend to develop esophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension. These esophageal varices may be asymptomatic until they abruptly rupture and cause severe hematemesis. As a preventive measure, then, all patients with cirrhosis of the liver should be screened for esophageal varices by endoscopy. Primary prophylaxis should include beta-blockers, which will significantly reduce the risk of bleeding.\n(Choice B) Proctoscopy is used in cirrhotic patients to diagnose hemorrhoids, which can develop secondary to portal hypertension. However, because hemorrhoids are a less common complication than esophageal varices and are not typically acutely life-threatening, proctoscopy is not the most important intervention at this time.\n(Choice C) Serum ammonia levels are often obtained in patients with suspected hepatic encephalopathy. Elevations are associated with a number of conditions, including Reye's syndrome, porto-systemic blood shunting, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal disease, urinary tract infection with urease-producing organisms, shock, and parenteral nutrition. As this patient does not appear to have hepatic encephalopathy, serum ammonia levels would not be of benefit at this time.\n(Choice D) Measurement of portal vein pressure is useful in diagnosing portal hypertension. However, as this patient already has signs and symptoms that are strongly suggestive of portal hypertension, it is less important to confirm the diagnosis than it is to screen for its most serious complication (esophageal varices).\n(Choice E) An abdominal CT scan would be of help in establishing the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. However it is not a particularly effective tool in the management of portal hypertension or suspected esophageal varices.\nEducational Objective:\nEndoscopy is the preferred screening tool for esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an RNA virus that causes an illness similar to that seen with hepatitis A infection. Histologically, hepatic biopsy in this patient population reveals focal necrosis, ballooned hepatocytes, and acidophilic hepatocytic degeneration. Transmission of HEV typically occurs through fecally contaminated water in endemic areas, with person-to-person transmission rare. Hepatitis E virus has a predictable geographical distribution, and is most commonly found in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America. It is highly unusual in the United States. Individuals aged 15-40 years are most commonly infected and appear to have an incubation period of 15-60 days, with abrupt onset of symptoms. Jaundice, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and hepatomegaly are the more common signs and symptoms. Laboratory findings include elevated serum bilirubin, ALT, and AST. Diagnosis is confirmed with detection of HEV RNA by PCR in the serum or feces or by the detection of IgM antibodies to HEV.\nHepatitis E infection is self-limited, with no chronic carrier state. There is no progression to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. However, fulminant hepatitis can occur, and results in an overall case fatality rate of 0.5-3%. More alarmingly, fulminant hepatitis occurs in 15-25% of pregnant women infected with hepatitis E virus, especially those in the third trimester. There is also evidence to suggest that hepatitis E infection can be vertically transmitted, with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality.\nThere is little information available about the efficacy of immune globulin in HEV prevention, and therefore it is not typically recommended. Travelers to endemic areas should be advised to minimize exposure to water of unknown purity.\n(Choice A) Hepatitis E is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route, not sexual contact.\n(Choice B) An effective HEV vaccine is not widely available at this time.\n(Choice D) Hepatitis E virus infection does not result in a chronic carrier state.\n(Choice E) Hepatitis E is very rare in the United States and is more commonly seen in India, Asia, Africa, and Central America.\nEducational Objective:\nInfection with hepatitis E virus has a high rate of progression to fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women, especially in the third trimester."

    "question": "A 54-year-old male comes to your office complaining of fatigue, for the past month. He has no history of\npsychiatric disease. On examination, he has icteric sclerae and mild hepatomegaly. His laboratory report\nshows total bilirubin: 3.9 mg/dl, AST. 550 IU/L, ALT: 600 IU/L, albumin: 34 g/dl, and PT. 11sec. His viral\nseralogy tests are positive for HCV RNA. A liver biopsy is done which shows moderate inflammation with\nsome portal and bridging fibrosis. What is the most appropriate intervention at this time?",
    "options": [
      "A. Start the patient on combined interferon and ribavirin",
      "B. Start the patient on combined interferon and lamivudine",
      "C. Do nothing at this time",
      "D. Schedule the patient far liver transplantation",
      "E. Start the patient an interferon alpha anly"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The decision to treat a patient of chronic hepatitis C depends on several factors like:\n1. Natural history of disease\n2. Stage of the disease\n3. Findings of liver biopsy\n4. The levels of liver enzymes\n5 Presence of HCV RNA\n6. Efficacy and adverse effects of the drugs in the patient.\nAll chronic hepatitis C patients with elevated ALT, detectable HCV RNA, and chronic hepatitis of at least moderate grade are candidates for antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin (Choice A). Combination therapy has shown to be more beneficial than monotherapy with either interferon or ribavirin in the above setting.\n(Choice B) Combined therapy with interferon and lamivudine is used in treatment of hepatitis B not for hepatitis C.\n(Choice C) This patient is having elevated ALT with positive HCV RNA and mild fibrosis which suggest progressive liver injury. Doing nothing and only follow up in patients with chronic hepatitis is justified only if they have persistently normal ALT levels and mild elevation of the other liver enzymes.\n(Choice D) Liver transplantation is the final resort in case of decompensated liver cirrhosis. However, this patient has a normal PT and serum albumin levels.\n(Choice E) Monotherapy with interferon alpha only would have been sufficient in the case of patients with a mild grade of chronic hepatitis C.\nEducational Objective:\nAll chronic hepatitis C patients with elevated ALT, detectable HCV RNA and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis of at least moderate grade are candidates for antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin."

    "question": "A 52-year-old female insurance claims analyst presents to her primary care physician with complaints of\nintense itching and fatigue. She is unable to specify when her symptoms started as they developed gradually.\nHer medical history is significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and carpal tunnel syndrome. She takes\natenolol and levothyroxine and has no known drug allergies. She lives with her husband and three children,\ndoes not smoke, and drinks wine an sacial occasions. On physical examination, the lungs are clear to\nauscultation and a normal S1 and S2 are heard with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft with\nactive bowel sounds. Hepatomegaly is present. There is no scleral icterus or jaundice, but bilateral\nxanthelasma and skin excoriations are evident. Laboratory evaluation includes the following:\nTotal cholesteral                                      403 mg/dL\nSerum IgM                                            380 mg/dL\nLiver studies\nTotal bilirubin                                          1.2 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin                                        0.2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase                                 410 UL\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT)           42 iL\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGFT)              44 iL\nA biopsy of the liver is obtained, which reveals inflammation and destruction of medium-sized bile ducts.\nWhich of the following is most likely ta be present in this woman's serum?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies",
      "B. Anti-nuclear antibodies",
      "C. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies",
      "D. Anti-Smith antibodies",
      "E. P-ANCA"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient is suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a chronic liver disease characterized by autoimmune destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts and cholestasis. The condition presents most commonly in middle-aged women and is insidious in onset. Pruritus is usually the first symptom and may be very severe, especially at night. Fatigue is also often reported. Physical findings typically include hepatosplenomegaly and xanthomatous lesions in the eyelids or in the skin and tendons. As the disease progresses, jaundice, steatorrhea, portal hypertension, and osteopenia may develop.\nAbnormalities on laboratory testing are consistent with cholestasis and include elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol as well as elevated serum IgM. Diagnosis is confirmed with demonstration of anti-mitochondrial antibodies in the serum. Associated conditions include Sjogren syndrome, Raynaud syndrome, scleroderma, autoimmune thyroid disease, hypothyroidism, and celiac disease. The risk of hepatobiliary malignancies is elevated in those patients diagnosed with PBC.\nUrsodeoxycholic acid is the drug of choice in treating PBC as it slows disease progression. Methotrexate and colchicine have also been shown to be of moderate benefit. Advanced disease is an indication for liver transplantation, which offers a 1-year survival rate of 85-80% and is the only definitive treatment. Without transplantation, survival averages 7-10 years after symptoms first arise.\n(Choice B) Testing for anti-nuclear antibodies is useful as an initial screening for suspected collagen vascular diseases. Anti-nuclear antibodies are strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 autoimmune hepatitis.\n(Choices C and F) Anti-smooth muscle antibodies and anti LKM antibodies are associated with acute and chronic hepatitis. The highest titers are linked with chronic active hepatitis.\n(Choice D) Anti-Smith antibodies are highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus but are found in only 30-50% of SLE cases.\n(Choice E) P-ANCA is associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome and microscopic polyangiitis.\nEducational Objective:\nAnti-mitochondrial antibodies are present in 90% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease characterized by autoimmune destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts and cholestasis."

    "question": "A 41-year-old Caucasian male computer programmer presents for a routine health examination required by\nhis insurance company. He has no pertinent medical history. He states that he has been happily married for\nfourteen years and is monogamous with his wife. He denies drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, or using\nrecreational drugs. His mother died of myocardial infarction at age 74. His father, who did not drink alcahal,\ndied of cirrhasis at age 50. Physical examination is unremarkable. Labaratory findings include the following:\nLiver studies\nTatal bilirubin                                          1.0 mg/dL\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT)            53 U/L mild\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT)             60 W/L mild\nIran studies\nSerum ferritin                                         640 ng/mL\nSerum iran                                            484 micro-gfdL\nWhich of the following is the mast likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hemaosiderosis",
      "B. Hemochromatasis",
      "C. Wilson's disease",
      "D. Metastatic melanoma ta liver"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This non-alcoholic patient has an asymptomatic elevation of serum transaminases, increased serum iron and ferritin levels, and a family history of non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. His presentation is strongly suggestive of hemochromatosis.\nMore common in males, hemochromatosis is a relatively common autosomal recessive disease in the United States with 0.5% of the Caucasian population homozygous for the classic gene mutation C282Y on chromosome 6. This mutation indirectly causes increased intestinal iron absorption, resulting in an accumulation of iron in the liver, pancreas, heart, adrenals, testes, pituitary, kidneys, joints, and skin. Disease onset is typically after age 50, with nonspecific symptoms in the early stages. Later signs and symptoms include arthropathy, hepatomegaly, skin pigmentation, cardiac enlargement, diabetes mellitus, and impotence. Eventually, patients may develop hepatic and pancreatic insufficiency, cirrhosis (with the accompanying risk of hepatocellular carcinoma), congestive heart failure, and hypogonadism. Laboratory findings include mildly elevated liver function tests, elevated plasma iron with more than 50% saturation of transferrin, and elevated serum ferritin.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment have a significant impact on patient prognosis. Patients should avoid all iron-rich foods and undergo weekly phlebotomy treatments for up to 2-3 years as a means of depleting iron stores. Deferoxamine, a chelator, is a second-line treatment indicated for patients with high iron levels who cannot tolerate phlebotomies. All first-degree relatives of patients homozygous for the mutation should consider undergoing genetic testing.\n(Choice A) Hemosiderosis is the deposition of excessive iron in the tissues. It is caused by a variety of inherited metabolic disorders or by environmental exposure to iron-containing substances, and is therefore not considered to be a distinct disease entity.\n(Choice C) Although Wilson's disease may cause an asymptomatic elevation of the transaminases, it would typically also be associated with a decreased ceruloplasmin level, Kayser-Fleischer rings, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Wilson's disease also tends to appear at a younger age.\n(Choice D) Metastatic melanoma is highly unlikely, as this patient has no evidence of primary melanoma on physical examination. Moreover, the diagnosis of melanoma would not explain the patient's abnormalities in serum iron and ferritin concentrations.\n(Choice E) This patient has elevated transaminases, serum iron, and ferritin. It would be inappropriate to dismiss such findings as normal without further investigation.\nEducational Objective:\nHemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased skin pigmentation, diabetes, cirrhosis and arthralgia in the later stages."

      "C. Chest-X ray",
      "D. CT abdomen",
      "E. Liver function tests"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has massive ascites, which by definition is severe enough to cause respiratory distress. In this situation a paracentesis would be the next best step, as it will be both a diagnostic and therapeutic in this patient. Ascitic fluid examination would help us focus on the cause of ascites and volume paracentesis will drain the fluid and relieve the respiratory distress in the patient. Later the patient should be started on diuretics (Choice B).\n(Choices A and D) Ultrasonogram of abdomen and CT scan will tell us about the amount of fluid and if there is any hepatomegaly but still want tell us about nature of ascitic fluid and would not relieve the respiratory distress. However, either one of them should be done on this patient later.\n(Choice C) Chest x-ray can tell us more about the rales and any cardiomegaly, but it too will not address the respiratory distress. However it should be done later.\n(Choice D) LFTs will be of no use unless the ascitic fluid turns out to be a transudate. However, it should be done later.\nEducational Objective:\nParacentesis can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in patients with ascites."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant cancer making it fifth most common cause of cancer related mortality. It results in death in 98% of afflicted individuals (98% fatality rate). Risk factors for pancreatic cancer are:\n1. Male sex.\n2 Increasing age (50 years).\n3. Black race.\n4 Cigarette smoking: It is the most consistent risk factor. Pancreatic cancer is 2-3 times more likely in heavy smokers than in nonsmokers.\n5. Chronic pancreatitis.\n6.

    "question": "A 40-year-old Asian American male presents to clinic with the complaint of unusually dark urine. He has\nrecently maved to this city and has not been under the care of a physician far same time. Physical\nexamination reveals scleral icterus and jaundiced skin. A urine dipstick is positive far bilirulin. Which of the\nfollowing is a possible cause of these findings?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hemalytic anemia",
      "B. Thalassemia",
      "C. Rotor syndrome",
      "D. Gilbert's syndrome",
      "E. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "After taking a history and performing a physical examination in a patient presenting with jaundice, the next step is to determine whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. This can be evaluated by urine dipstick, a test that is simple and convenient. Normally, more than 95% of circulating bilirubin is the unconjugated fraction, which is highly insoluble in water and is tightly bound to albumin. When bound, this unconjugated bilirubin cannot be filtered by the glomerulus and is therefore not excreted in the urine. In contrast, the conjugated bilirubin is water soluble, loosely bound to albumin, and excreted in urine when present in excess. Therefore, the presence of bilirubin in urine is indicative of a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (as seen In this patient). Of the given options, only Rotor syndrome can result in a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\nRotor syndrome is a benign condition in which there is a defect of hepatic storage of conjugated bilirubin, resulting in its leakage into the plasma. Liver function tests are normal, and treatment is unnecessary.\n(Choice A) Hemolytic anemia can result in an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It may develop secondary to a number of conditions, including intrinsic red blood cell membrane defects, hemoglobinopathies, erythrocyte enzymatic defects, immune destruction of erythrocytes, mechanical injury, and hypersplenism.\n(Choice B) The thalassemias are a group of diseases in which one or more globin chains are reduced or absent. Bizarre red blood cell morphology, profound microcytic anemia, and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are common findings.\n(Choice D) Clinical manifestations of Gilbert's syndrome include icterus secondary to a mild, predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (normal levels in these patients are = 3 mg/dL) Those patients who are symptomatic tend to have nonspecific complaints, including malaise, fatigue, or abdominal discomfort. Certain events, such as hemolysis, fasting or consuming a fat-free diet, physical exertion, febrile illness, stress, or fatigue are thought to be triggers for hyperbilirubinemia in patients with Gilbert’s syndrome.\n(Choice E) Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired hemolytic anemia characterized by the abnormal susceptibility of the red blood cell membrane to the hemolytic action of complement. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results and is frequently accompanied by thrombosis and pancytopenia.\nEducational Objective:\nThe presence of bilirubin in urine is indicative of a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents for a routine health examination because it is a requirement far his new job. He\nhas no complaints at this time. He states that he has no history of medical problems and takes no\nmedications. He admits to frequent intravenous drug abuse and intranasal cocaine abuse. Physical\nexamination is unremarkable, with na evidence of hepatomegaly or icterus. Serologic testing for hepatitis C is\nperformed. Which of the following is the single most sensitive serological marker used to screen for HCV\ninfection?",
    "options": [
      "A. Serum aminotransferase",
      "B. HCV RNA",
      "C. Ant-HCV RNA",
      "D. Serum alkaline phosphatase",
      "E. Liver biopsy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Although there has been a recent marked increase in cases of blood transfusion-related hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the risk of acquiring the virus through transfusion was recently estimated to be <1:540 000. Intravenous drug abuse continues to account for 50-75% of all new cases of HCV infection. Since this patient is an intravenous drug abuser, he is at high risk for infection with HCV. Intranasal cocaine abuse is also an independent risk factor for HCV infection, thereby increasing the likelihood that this patient will test positive. Other risk factors include body piercing, hemodialysis, and multiple sexual partners.\nAs the first marker of HCV infection to appear in the serum, HCV RNA may be detected with PCR within days to weeks after infection, depending on the size of the inoculum. Because this test is the most sensitive serological marker for diagnosis of HCV infection, it is considered the gold standard. HCV RNA can be detected before elevation of aminotransferases and before the appearance of anti-HCV. Moreover, HCV RNA is detectable indefinitely (continuously or intermittently) in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.\n(Choice A) The serum aminotransferases are nonspecific markers of hepatic injury that become elevated approximately 6-12 weeks after exposure to HCV. These levels tend to wax and wane. Normalization of serum ALT concentration in a patient with known HCV infection does not indicate that the infection has resolved.\n(Choice C) Commonly used in the diagnosis of hepatitis C infection, anti-HCV antibodies can be detected with the ELISA technique as early as eight weeks after exposure. However, some patients may not be positive for several months after exposure or may never test positive. In addition, this marker does not distinguish between acute and chronic infections. Anti-HCV is considered to have moderate sensitivity early in the disease course but low specificity in patients with elevated gamma globulin levels. If infection is clinically suspected but not confirmed by the presence of anti-HCV, then HCV RNA levels should be obtained.\n(Choice D) Serum alkaline phosphatase is a better indicator of biliary tract pathology than of hepatitis.\n(Choice E) Liver biopsy is not a screening tool for viral hepatitis, as the appropriate serological tests are more sensitive and cost-effective. Liver biopsy is typically of considerable help in determining the etiology of a hepatic mass or infiltrative liver disease, however.\nEducational Objective:\nHCV RNA is the single most sensitive serological marker used in screening for HCV infection."

Aspiration reveals material that resembles \"anchovy paste.\"",
    "options": [
      "A. Surgical resection of the mass",
      "B. Inttiate aral metronidazole therapy",
      "C. Perform percutaneous drainage",
      "D. Admit the patient and initiate intravenous ceftriaxone"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has an amebic liver abscess due to Entamoeba histolytica. The history of travel to an endemic area and the complaint of bloody diarrhea followed by right upper quadrant pain and a single liver abscess are highly suggestive of amebiasis. Amebic liver abscesses most often occur in men and are typically solitary and located in the right lobe of the liver. Although the patient is a recent immigrant from Mexico, he reports having had bloody diarrhea six months prior to presentation, suggesting that the amebic liver abscess developed after his return. Symptoms of amebic liver abscess are nonspecific and include right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, anorexia, and cough. Elevated liver enzymes and leukocytosis are also commonly noted. Rupture of the abscess is a feared complication and should be considered in patients who develop peritonitis, pleural effusion, or fistula formation.\nAmebic liver abscesses within the liver contain debris characterized as \"anchovy paste\" in appearance, though cyst aspiration is not typically recommended because of the associated risks (eg, bleeding, amebic peritonitis, puncture of an echinococcal cyst, secondary bacterial infection). When it is deemed necessary, however, these abscesses are found to contain acellular proteinaceous material that is often described as an \"anchovy paste.\" The fluid within the cyst is usually sterile and odorless unless secondarily infected.\nThe diagnosis of amebiasis is confirmed with ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Typically, a solitary lesion is found. Supplemental laboratory findings that support the diagnosis include leukocytosis (=10,000/mm3) or an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Serologic testing is increasingly helpful in detecting amebiasis, especially when there are no extraintestinal findings on imaging. Fecal microscopy demonstrates ameba in fewer than 20% of cases and is therefore not a recommended means of diagnosis.\nTreatment requires both tissue and luminal agents. Commonly used tissue agents include metronidazole and tinidazole, while commonly used luminal agents include paromomycin, iodoquinol, or diloxanide furoate. The oral dose of metronidazole results in cure for more than 90% of patients within seven to ten days.\n(Choice A) In general, surgical resection of hepatic amebic abscess is not first-line treatment as it is associated with numerous risks. Surgical intervention may be indicated, however, when the abscess has ruptured, eroded into adjacent structures, or caused extrahepatic complications such as small bowel obstruction.\n(Choice C) Drainage of the amebic abscess is not routinely done.\n(Choice D) Intravenous antibiotics and drainage are recommended for the treatment of pyogenic abscess, a condition that occurs in patients who are typically older and much more debilitated. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics like ceftriaxone are appropriate in the treatment of pyogenic abscess when administered in conjunction with metronidazole.\n(Choice E) Observation is not appropriate management of any abscess.\nEducational Objective:\nAmebic abscesses within the liver contain debris characterized as \"anchovy paste” in appearance, though cyst aspiration is not typically recommended because of the associated risks. Treatment is with oral metronidazole."

    "question": "A G60-year-old Hispanic female presents ta clinic complaining of a lengthy history of intermittent right upper\nquadrant abdominal pain after meals. A review of her medical record indicates she was treated for an\nepisode of acute cholecystitis a few years ago but that she did not follow up. An ultrasound of the abdomen\nreveals a small contracted gallbladder that contains multiple stones. The patient is referred far\ncholecystectomy and tolerates the surgery well. A biopsy report on the operative specimen establishes the\ndiagnosis of carcinoma of the gallbladder. Which of the following statements is true about gallbladder\ncarcinoma?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gallbladder carcinoma is one of the more common carcinomas",
      "B. Gallbladder carcinoma can be easily diagnosed preoperatively",
      "C.CA18-9is a specific marker for gallbladder carcinoma",
      "D. Chronic chaledocholithiasis is nat a risk factar for gallbladder carcinoma",
      "E. Cholecystectomy is sufficient treatment of carcinoma confined to the gallbladder mucosa"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a rare but highly fatal malignancy that is more common in women, Southwestern Native Americans, and Mexican-Americans. Incidence increases with age. Other risk factors are associated with chronic gallbladder inflammation, and include a history of gallstones (70-90% of patients with GBC have had gallstones), porcelain gallbladder, salmonella typhi carriage, anatomic variations (eg, congenital cysts, abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction), and carcinogen exposure. Most gallbladder carcinomas are discovered incidentally when exploring biliary tracts for cholelithiasis, with 1-2% of such cases positive for cancer.\nBecause the symptoms of gallbladder carcinoma are vague and nonspecific (eg, pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, malaise) and the gallbladder is nestled among other organs, GBC tends to be late-presenting and to have spread by the time of diagnosis. Radical surgical intervention for patients with advanced disease includes cholecystectomy and removal of the gallbladder bed, pancreatic head, lymph nodes, and sometimes portions of the liver or biliary tree. If the GBC is discovered while still confined to the lamina propria of the gallbladder, however, simple cholecystectomy results in a cure rate of 75-100% and is considered sufficient treatment.\n(Choice A) Gallbladder carcinoma is a rare malignancy, with fewer than 5,000 cases diagnosed per year in the United States. It is the fifth most common gastrointestinal cancer.\n(Choice B) Gallbladder carcinoma is typically diagnosed intraoperatively and is difficult to diagnose preoperatively. It is recommended that all patients with gallbladder polyps, thickened gallbladder walls, jaundice, or high serum bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase be assessed with endoscopic ultrasound in an effort to detect GBC at an earlier stage.\n(Choice C) Serum tumor markers like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or CA 19-9 are frequently elevated in patients with GBC but are not helpful in the diagnosis of this malignancy because they lack sensitivity and specificity. Both tumor markers are occasionally used as rough indicators of disease remission after treatment, however.\n(Choice D) Chronic choledocholithiasis is a risk factor for GBC because it causes inflammation and irritation of the gallbladder epithelium, thereby inviting malignant change.\nEducational Objective:\nGallbladder carcinoma is a rare malignancy that most often arises in Hispanic and Southwestern Native American females who have a history of gallstones. It is typically diagnosed during or after cholecystectomy."

She is divorced, lives alone, and warks fram home as a freelance artist. She denies any history of\nsmoking, drinking, or using illicit drugs. Her labaratory evaluation reveals the following:\nLiver studies:\nAlbumin                                       3.9 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin                                  1.3 mygfdL\nAlkaline phosphatase                         168 L/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (SGOT)         141 L/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (SGPT)            130 L/L\nAmylase                                      840 UL\nLipase                                         g155 LIL\nComplete blood count:\nHemaglobin                                   128 g/lL\nPlatelets                                         220 000/mm3\nLeukocyte count                              16,200/mm3\nShe is admitted to the hospital and is treated supportively with pain control, intravenous fluids, and nothing by\nmauth.

    "options": [
      "B. Order endoscopic retrograde pancreatography to evaluate for pancreatic damage",
      "C. Continue to obtain serial amylase and lipase levels as follow-up",
      "D. Order abdominal CT to rule out pancreatic carcinoma",
      "E. Recommend no additional follow-up"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient experienced acute mid-epigastric pain radiating to her back, leukocytosis, and markedly elevated serum amylase and lipase levels. This triad of findings is suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Because she is a non-alcoholic and does not take any medications, her acute pancreatitis was most likely secondary to the gallstones she was previously diagnosed with. Gallstones are responsible for most episodes of acute pancreatitis in non-alcoholics.\nAs this patient's symptoms and laboratory values have improved, her attack of acute pancreatitis is considered resolved. However, she is at increased risk for recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis secondary to gallstones. Cholecystectomy is indicated for all patients with symptomatic gallstones who are medically stable enough for surgery, which is why she should be now scheduled for the procedure.\n(Choice B) Patients with severe biliary pancreatitis may benefit from early intervention with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP), but the procedure is not indicated in patients who have recovered from an attack of acute pancreatitis and are no longer symptomatic. Other indications for the performance of ERCP include the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, the diagnosis of ampullary cancers, the need to obtain tissue samples, and the need for bile duct exploration.\n(Choice C) Regular follow-up with serum amylase and lipase levels is indicated when conservatively treating patients with acute pancreatitis. However, in patients who have recovered from a bout of acute pancreatitis, the treatment of the underlying cause is the highest priority.\n(Choice D) Pancreatic carcinoma can present with obstructive jaundice or vague abdominal pain. This patient's symptoms were more consistent with acute pancreatitis, which has now resolved.\n(Choice E) Although this patient is no longer symptomatic, she is at risk for recurrent pancreatitis because of her gallstones. Therefore, it is imperative that the underlying cause of her pancreatitis be treated to prevent future attacks.\nEducational Objective:\nCholecystectomy is indicated in all patients with symptomatic gallstones who are medically stable enough to undergo surgery."

    "question": "A 59-year-old woman presents complaining of right upper quadrant pain and nausea. The pain comes an\nafter a particularly large meal and typically lasts one hour. She has not felt well far the past six manths, with\nthe pain occurring mare frequently over the last three or four months. Laboratory testing is unremarkable and\nan electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus tachycardia. An abdominal radiograph is shown below.\nWhich of the following conditions is this patient at greatest risk for developing?",
    "options": [
      "A. Pancreatitis",
      "B. Hepatic abscess",
      "C. Cancer",
      "D. Bowel obstruction"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This abdominal radiograph contains the classic finding of a \"porcelain gallbladder\" a term used to describe the bluish, brittle, calcium-laden gallbladder wall that can develop in some patients with chronic cholecystitis. The porcelain gallbladder is typically diagnosed on radiograph, sometimes incidentally, by a rim of calcium deposits that outline the gallbladder. The pathogenesis of the condition remains unclear, but it is thought that calcium salts are deposited intramurally secondary to either chronic irritation from gallstones or as a component of the natural progression of chronic inflammation. Although patients are often asymptomatic, some may present with right upper quadrant pain or with a firm, nontender mass in the right upper quadrant.\nCholecystectomy is recommended for those with porcelain gallbladders because 11-33% of this patient population will eventually develop gallbladder carcinoma.\n(Choice A) Pancreatitis is not directly related to the presence of porcelain gallbladder. Some causes of pancreatitis include cholelithiasis, ethanol use, medications (eg, thiazides), and hypertriglyceridemia. Symptoms vary from mild to severe epigastric abdominal pain. The diagnosis is confirmed with elevation of serum amylase or lipase.\n(Choice B) Liver abscess is not a complication of porcelain gallbladder. The majority of liver abscesses are amebic in origin, while some are bacterial. Portal vein bacteremia, systemic bacteremia, ascending cholangitis, and trauma are all potential causative conditions. Ultrasound or CT is usually diagnostic. Amebic abscesses require antibiotic therapy, whereas bacterial abscesses require drainage and antibiotics.\n(Choice D) Porcelain gallbladder is not typically associated with bowel obstruction. Gallstone ileus is a known complication, however, as large gallstones can cause a fistula to form between the gallbladder and small intestine. The gallstone then enters and obstructs the intestine. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of air in the biliary tract, and surgery is required.\n(Choice E) Porcelain gallbladder does not cause constipation.\nEducational Objective:\nPorcelain gallbladder results from the intramural deposition of calcium salts and is usually diagnosed on abdominal radiograph. The condition is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder carcinoma and requires surgical resection."

      "C. Granulomatous liver disease",
      "D. Ischemic hepatic injury",
      "E. Acalculous cholecystitis",
      "F. Iron overload",
      "G. Autoimmune hepatitis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient presented with septic shock and developed AST and ALT elevations one day later. This is most consistent with ischemic hepatic injury, or shock liver. The hallmark of ischemic hepatopathy is a rapid and massive increase in the transaminases with modest accompanying elevations in total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. In patients who survive the underlying cause of their hypotension (e.g. septic shock, heart failure), liver enzymes typically return to normal within one to two weeks.\n(Choice A) Acute hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection can present with large AST and ALT elevations, typically accompanied by significant hyperbilirubinemia, nausea, and vomiting.\n(Choice B) Alcoholic liver disease typically causes less dramatic increases in the transaminases compared to those seen above. The AST:ALT ratio is usually 1.5 or greater, and the AST itself is rarely greater than 300 units/L.\n(Choice C) Granulomatous disorders like tuberculosis and sarcoidosis rarely cause massive transaminase elevations. Chronic hepatic damage is occasionally associated.\n(Choice E) Acalculous cholecystitis is a common complication of critical illness that arises secondary to gallbladder stasis. Patients present with symptoms of biliary obstruction. Alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels will be more elevated than the AST and ALT.\n(Choice F) Iron overload may cause chronic hepatic dysfunction with low-grade elevations in the AST and ALT. Four transfusions would be unlikely to cause iron overload.\n(Choice G) Autoimmune hepatitis may cause large increases in the AST and ALT. However, young women are more commonly affected, and the associated serum bilirubin increases are typically more dramatic.\nEducational objective:\nIschemic hepatic injury occurs in the setting of hypotension and manifests as acute, massive increases in the AST and ALT with milder associated increases in the total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. In patients who survive the inciting condition, liver enzymes typically return to normal within a few weeks."

    "options": [
      "A Initiate corticosteroids",
      "B. Initiate interferon",
      "C. Initiate lamivudine",
      "D. Place her an liver transplant list",
      "rv BE Adminictaer frach fromvaen mlacrma"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Acute hepatitis B infection has an incubation period that varies from one to four months. Most patients are asymptomatic and have subclinical or anicteric hepatitis. Some develop a serum sickness-like syndrome that is followed by fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels may reach 1000-2000 IU/L, with the ALT typically higher than the AST. In most patients, symptoms gradually disappear and aminotransferase levels normalize over a few months. In the United States, sexual contact and percutaneous transmission (eg, intravenous drug abuse) are the primary means of acquiring hepatitis B infection.\nThis patient clearly has an acute hepatitis B infection, as evidenced by her serology findings and markedly elevated ALT. More than 90% of adults with acute hepatitis B infection will recover completely. A minority will proceed to develop chronic hepatitis B infection, and approximately 0.1-0 5% will develop fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Fulminant hepatic failure is defined as hepatic encephalopathy that develops within eight weeks of the onset of acute liver failure. It develops more commonly in patients who are heavier users of acetaminophen, alcohol, or methamphetamines and in those who are co-infected with hepatitis B and D viruses. As our patient has hepatic encephalopathy (in conjunction with a markedly increased ALT, an increased PT, and coagulopathy), she has clearly developed fulminant hepatic failure.\nBecause FHF has a mortality rate that exceeds 80%, patients with this condition are considered high-priority candidates for liver transplantation if a suitable donor is available. Orthotopic liver transplantation remains the only effective mode of treatment of FHF and must be considered in all patients presenting with the condition, regardless of etiology, as these patients are at great risk of dying within days of symptom onset. General contraindications to liver transplantation include irreversible cardiopulmonary disease that poses a prohibitive risk, incurable or recent (< 5 years) malignancy external to the liver, and active alcohol and drug abuse. Because this patient is no longer abusing drugs or alcohol, she would be considered an appropriate candidate for liver transplantation.\n(Choice A) Corticosteroids are not useful in the management of fulminant hepatic failure.\n(Choices B and C) Interferon and lamivudine are used in the treatment of acute hepatitis B infection, but have no role in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure, which is the more urgent concern in this patient.\n(Choice E) Fresh frozen plasma in conjunction with intravenous vitamin K administration can be employed to manage the coagulopathy (active bleeding) associated with fulminant hepatic failure. However, the prophylactic administration of FFP is not recommended since it has not been proven to change the mortality.\nEducational Objective:\nOrthotopic liver transplantation remains the only effective mode of treatment of fulminant hepatic failure and should be considered in any patient presenting with this condition, regardless of etiology."

    "question": "A 57-year-old man has had intermittent arthralgias for the past 8 years. Over the same period of time he has\nhad transient elevations of his AST and ALT. He had an episode of jaundice two years ago after having his\nmitral valve replaced. His current liver function tests are within normal limits. What is the most likely cause\nof his problem?",
    "options": [
      "A Acute hepatitis A",
      "B. Acute hepatitis B",
      "C. Acute hepatitis C",
      "D. Chronic hepatitis B",
      "E. Chronic hepatitis C"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has chronic hepatitis C. Acute infection is typically asymptomatic, but 80% of patients go on to develop chronic hepatitis C. This infection is typically mild, asymptomatic, and characterized by waxing and waning transaminase levels. Twenty percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis. Lab values and hepatic function often worsen in the setting of physiological stress. Extrahepatic sequelae of chronic hepatitis C can include chronic arthralgias (often with a false-positive rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibody), cryoglobulinemia, porphyria cutanea tarda, and glomerulonephritis.\n(Choice A) Acute hepatitis A presents with mild influenza-like symptoms that progress to jaundice, abdominal pain, and dark urine. It lasts days to weeks and typically resolves without chronic sequelae.\n(Choice B) Acute hepatitis B presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and jaundice 1 to 6 months after exposure to the virus. Acute hepatitis B cannot account for this patient's recurring transaminitis.\n(Choice C) Acute hepatitis C is typically asymptomatic. Furthermore, an acute viral infection would not cause lab abnormalities spanning years.\n(Choice D) Patients with chronic hepatitis B are less likely to have waxing and waning transaminase levels and arthralgias than patients with chronic hepatitis C.\nEducational objective:\nChronic hepatitis C classically presents with waxing and waning transaminase levels but few symptoms. Patients may complain of arthralgias or myalgias. Extrahepatic sequelae include cryoglobulinemia, porphyria cutanea tarda, and glomerulonephritis."

    "options": [
      "A. No treatment is necessary",
      "B. Administration of hepatitis B immune globulin followed by hepatitis B vaccine vaccination",
      "C. Administration of hepatitis B vaccine",
      "D. Administration of hepatitis B immune globulin",
      "E. Observation af child with repeat seralagical testing far hepatitis B"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Vertical transmission of hepatitis B from pregnant females to the unborn child can occur with active hepatitis B infection. Typically, such transmission takes place during the passage of the fetus through the birth canal, but transplacental infection can also occur. This is especially common in those women who developed acute hepatitis B infection in the third trimester.\nThe diagnosis of acute hepatitis B infection is supported by this woman's positivity for HBsAg (a surface antigen that is the first evidence of infection), HBeAg (a soluble protein that is a marker of viral replication and infectivity), and IgM anti-HBcAg (antibody to hepatitis B core antigen). Were this woman HBeAg negative, her neonate's risk of infection would be 20%. Since she is HBeAg positive, however, her neonate's risk of infection is 95%. If the infant does become infected, his chance of progression to chronic hepatitis is 90%. Therefore, the newborns of all mothers with active hepatitis B should be passively immunized at birth with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), followed by active immunization with recombinant HBV vaccine.\n(Choices A and E) Withholding treatment in this case is highly inappropriate because 90% of cases of hepatitis B in the newborn will progress to chronic hepatitis. In contrast, the rate of progression to chronic hepatitis in adults with hepatitis B is only 10%.\n(Choice D) Passive immunization with HBIG provides only temporary protection and is therefore not sufficient treatment when given alone.\n(Choice C) Active immunization with HB is of some benefit but does not provide suitable protection alone in post-exposure cases. Fortunately, hepatitis B vaccination has now been included in the standard neonatal immunization schedule, and all newborns should receive three doses of the HBV vaccine.\nEducational Objective:\nNewborns of mothers with active hepatitis B infection should be passively immunized at birth with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) followed by active immunization with recombinant HBV vaccine."

    "question": "A 44-year-old American male presents to his primary care physician because he is planning to leave for a\ntwo-week trip to Mexico this weekend. He is concerned about \"all those diseases\" associated with drinking\nunpurified water there and specifically requests prophylaxis for viral hepatitis. He is a monogamous,\nheterosexual male with no history of illicit drug abuse. He is in good spirits and feeling healthy. His medical\nhistary is significant anly for acid reflux treated with ranitidine. His physical examination is unremarkable. Viral\nseralogy testing dane for hepatitis two months ago at a health fair was negative. Which of the following is the\nmost appropriate next step in the management of this patient's care?",
    "options": [
      "A. Recommend hepatitis A vaccine",
      "B. Recommend serum immune globulin against hepatitis A",
      "C. Recommend hepatitis B vaccine",
      "D. Recommend serum immune globulin against hepatitis B",
      "E. Recommend no prophylaxis at this time"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hepatitis A is endemic in many parts of the world outside of the United States, and is most commonly transmitted via the fecal-oral route. A non-immunized person from the United States who travels to an endemic region should prepare beforehand with prophylaxis against hepatitis A. The two available forms of prophylaxis include a vaccine, which provides active immunity, and serum immune globulin, which provides passive immunity.\nActive immunity with the hepatitis A vaccine is preferred but requires four weeks to take effect. A booster vaccination after 6 to 12 months is then necessary to ensure long-term protection. In contrast, hepatitis A immune globulin can be administered shortly before departure and will provide passive immunity for approximately 4 to 6 months. Therefore, providing the serum immune globulin is most important for this patient, as he intends to visit an endemic area within the next week.\n(Choice A) Hepatitis A vaccine should be given to this man if he intends to visit endemic areas again at some future date. Because it will not provide protection against hepatitis A until four weeks have elapsed, however, it would need to be supplemented with an injection of serum immune globulin at another site on the body.\n(Choices C and D) This patient is a monogamous and heterosexual male who does not use illicit drugs. Because hepatitis B virus is typically transmitted through sexual or percutaneous routes (rather than the fecal-oral route), he is not at high risk for becoming infected.\n(Choice E) This patient does not have antibodies against hepatitis A and is traveling to an endemic country, which places him at high risk of contracting hepatitis A. It is therefore inappropriate to deny him prophylaxis.\nEducational Objective:\nHepatitis A vaccine or serum immune globulin should be given to all non-immunized travelers to endemic countries. If travel will occur in less than four weeks, serum immune globulin should be given. If travel will occur in greater than four weeks, hepatitis A vaccine should be given instead as it offers long-term protection."

      "C. Pulmonary hypertension",
      "D. Alcoholic cirrhosis",

      "F. Metastatic disease",
      "G. Autoimmune hepatitis",
      "H. Hemochromatosis"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient has a gastrointestinal malignancy, likely colon cancer, metastatic to the liver. The liver is the most common site of metastasis in colon cancer. There are several suggestions that this patient has a metastatic gastrointestinal malignancy. First, he has a microcytic anemia due to occult GI bleeding. Second, his liver exam reveals firm hepatomegaly. This represents significant tumor infiltration of the liver and accounts for his chronic abdominal pain. Third, his liver enzymes are more suggestive of mild cholestatic disease (elevated alkaline phosphatase, slightly elevated AST and ALT) than hepatocellular injury. Fourth, he has a small pleural effusion on the left that may be malignant. Hepatic hydrothorax due to cirrhosis usually occurs on the right. This patient should have a CT of the abdomen with IV contrast to evaluate for malignancy.\n(Choice A) Cirrhotic and noncirrhotic portal hypertension may result in hepatomegaly accompanied by ascites and significant peripheral edema. Other signs of portal hypertension include esophageal varices, spider nevi, palmar erythema, and caput medusa. Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy are often seen.\n(Choice B) Left ventricular failure can cause hepatomegaly when it results in right ventricular failure. Once the right ventricle fails, there will be increased volume in the systemic venous system and congestive hepatomegaly can occur. Other signs of right ventricular failure will be present: peripheral edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, positive hepatojugular reflex, and an S3 on cardiac exam.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary hypertension results in congestive hepatomegaly once right ventricular failure occurs. As described above, this patient does not have right ventricular failure.\n(Choice D) In alcoholic liver disease, the AST is characteristically 1.5 – 2 times greater than the ALT. As described above, this patient does not have cirrhosis.\n(Choice E) Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is often asymptomatic and manifests as hepatomegaly with elevated transaminases. Imaging will reveal fatty infiltration of the liver. This patient drinks too much alcohol to be diagnosed with NASH.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The hepatic metabolism of bilirubin occurs in the following four stages: uptake from the bloodstream; storage within the hepatocyte; conjugation with glucuronic acid; and biliary excretion. In the normal individual, serum total bilirubin is 0 2-1 mg/dL, of which = 0.2 mg/dL is the direct fraction. Typically, elevated conjugated bilirubin levels are suggestive of hepatobiliary disease (eg, cirrhosis or hepatitis) because the bilirubin conjugates will reflux back into the plasma when the secretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile is slowed. In contrast, elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels occur with either increased bilirubin production (eg, hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, large hematoma) or decreased bilirubin conjugation (eg, Gilbert's syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, diffuse hepatocellular disease). Gilbert's syndrome is a benign hereditary condition characterized by a mild, predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that is thought to affect 3-10% of the United States population. The disorder is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), resulting in a reduction (but not absence) of UGT activity. The level of UGT activity is about 30% of normal in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. Because conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid is the rate-limiting step in bilirubin metabolism, even a slight reduction in UGT activity can result in mild hyperbilirubinemia.\nThe diagnosis is suggested in those patients with no apparent liver disease who have mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia thought to be provoked by one of the classic triggers. Presumptive diagnosis can be made when the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia persists with repeat testing, but liver function tests, complete blood count, blood smear, and reticulocyte count are normal.\nTreatment is generally considered to be unnecessary in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. However, its mode of inheritance should be discussed with patients as a means of preventing needless testing in similarly affected family members.\n(Choice A) Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 is an autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin metabolism characterized by severe jaundice and neurologic impairment due to kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy). In these infants, the indirect bilirubin levels are typically 20-25 mg/dL but can rise to as high as 50 mg/dL. Liver enzymes and histology are normal. If intravenous phenobarbital is administered, the serum bilirubin remains unchanged. Phototherapy or plasmapheresis are typically helpful in the short term, though liver transplant is the only curative option.\n(Choice B) Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 is a milder autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin metabolism characterized by lower serum bilirubin levels (=20 mg/dL) and survival into adulthood with no kernicterus or neurologic impairment. Liver enzymes and histology are normal. If intravenous phenobarbital is administered, the serum bilirubin is reduced. Treatment is often unnecessary in milder cases, though periodic administration of phenobarbital or clofibrate can reduce serum bilirubin levels if necessary.\n(Choices D and F) Chronic hemolysis can result in an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with anemia. Triggers such as fasting or stress are not characteristic of hemolysis. His hemoglobin and reticulocyte count are within normal limits. Since this patient is totally asymptomatic and it appears his condition was brought on by fasting, chronic hemolysis is an unlikely diagnosis.\n(Choice E) Rotor syndrome is a benign condition in which there is a defect of hepatic storage of conjugated bilirubin, resulting in its leakage into the plasma. Chronic and mild hyperbilirubinemia of both unconjugated and conjugated forms develops, without any suggestion of hemolysis. Liver function tests are normal, and treatment is unnecessary.\nEducational Objective:\nGilbert's syndrome, Crigler-Najjar type 1, and Crigler-Najjar type 2 are three familial disorders characterized by varying degrees of severity and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Know how to differentiate them."

The blood product being administered consists of irradiated,\nleukacyte-depleted packed red blood cells and has been screened for infectious agents. Minutes after the\ntransfusion starts, the patient begins to wheeze. This quickly progresses ta respiratory distress and the\npatient then loses consciousness. What is the most likely cause of his transfusion reaction?",
    "options": [
      "A. Reaction to cytokines stared in the transfused blood product",
      "B. ABO mismatching",
      "C. IgA deficiency",
      "D. Blood product contamination with bacteria",
      "E. Anamnestic antibody response against a minor RBC antigen"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This man is having an anaphylactic response to the red blood cell transfusion. Anaphylactic reactions to blood products occur in 1:20,000 to 1:50,000 transfusions. Anaphylaxis typically presents within minutes of starting the transfusion and manifests as wheezing, respiratory distress, tachycardia, and hypotension. A major risk factor for anaphylaxis from a blood product transfusion is IgA deficiency. A small percentage of patients with selective IgA deficiency develop class-specific anti-IgA IgG antibodies. When they are challenged with blood products containing IgA, they develop anaphylactic reactions. A similar mechanism has been seen in patients with ahaptoglobinemia and anti-haptoglobin antibodies. The risk of anaphylaxis can be decreased by using IgA deficient blood products or by performing several extra washes of red blood cell or platelet products.\n(Choice A) A reaction to cytokines stored in transfused blood products is thought to be the leading cause of febrile nonhemolytic reactions, the most common transfusion reaction. Stored leukocytes release cytokines that, when transfused, can cause transient fevers, chills, and malaise. This reaction does not cause respiratory distress or hypotension.\n(Choice B) ABO mismatching results in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction that manifests as fever, pain, and hemoglobinuria. It can progress to cardiovascular collapse and DIC. Unlike in anaphylaxis, wheezing and other respiratory complaints are not common in acute hemolytic reactions.\n(Choice D) Despite rigorous screening standards, a very small percentage of blood products are contaminated with infectious organisms. Obviously affected patients present variably, but symptoms within seconds or minutes would not be expected.\n(Choice E) Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions result from an anamnestic antibody response to a red blood cell antigen that the patient has previously encountered (either via pregnancy, transplant, or transfusion). The antibody is undetectable prior to transfusion but returns rapidly following transfusion. It typically causes low-grade hemolysis 2 to 10 days after transfusion.\nEducational objective:\nIgA deficiency significantly increases the risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction to transfused blood products. The risk of anaphylaxis may be reduced in susceptible patients by providing IgA-deficient blood products or by performing additional washes on red blood cell or platelet products."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A choledochal cyst is a congenital abnormality of the biliary ducts characterized by the dilatation of intra or extra-hepatic biliary ducts or both. It has a multifactorial origin, but most of the cases are related to an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction, which leads to weakness and dilatation of the biliary wall due to the reflux of alkaline pancreatic secretions into the biliary tree (Choice B). Various types of choledochal cysts are:\nType 1: Most common type, features the dilatation of the entire common hepatic and common bile ducts or segments of each.\nType 2: Relative isolated protrusions or diverticulae from the common bile duct wall.\nType 3: Cyst found in the intraduodenal part of common bile duct.\nType 4: Multiple dilatations in the intra and extra hepatic biliary tree.\nType 5: Isolated dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts.\nThe clinical presentation varies with the age. In infants it may present with jaundice and the passage of acholic stools. In children it causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and attacks of recurrent pancreatitis, which may be evident by increases in the amylase and lipase levels. Adults with choledochal cysts commonly present with vague epigastric or right upper quadrant abdominal pain or cholangitis. Choledochal cysts can degenerate into cholangiocarcinoma. The initial investigation of choice is an ultrasonogram followed by CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as needed.\n(Choice A) Caroli's syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by intrahepatic dilatation of bile ducts.\n(Choice C) Biliary abscess will generally present with clinical signs of fever, leukocytosis, and the patients are usually severely ill.\n(Choice D) Biliary atresia usually presents early in the infancy with marked obstructive jaundice and acholic stools.\n(Choice E) Pseudo pancreatic cyst is a complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis characterized by retroperitoneal/epigastric mass and high amylase. However, it will rarely cause a right upper quadrant mass and very mild jaundice by compressing the common bile duct. It is easily diagnosed by ultrasonogram.\nEducational Objective:\nCholedochal cysts are congenital abnormalities of the biliary tree characterized by dilatation of the intra and/or extra hepatic biliary ducts."

    "explanation": "Emphysematous cholecystitis is a form of acute cholecystitis that arises due to secondary infection of the gallbladder wall with gas-forming bacteria (eg, Clostridium, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella). Patients with this condition are typically males aged 50-70 years. Predisposing factors include vascular compromise (by obstruction or stenosis of the cystic artery, which is the sole arterial supply to the gallbladder), immunosuppression (as seen with diabetes mellitus), gallstones, and infection with gas-forming bacteria.\nClinical manifestations of emphysematous cholecystitis include right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. Crepitus in the abdominal wall adjacent to the gallbladder is occasionally detectable, but peritoneal signs are absent. Complications include gangrene and perforation. If perforation occurs, the abdominal pain is relieved but peritonitis results.\nDiagnosis is confirmed with an abdominal radiograph demonstrating air fluid levels in the gallbladder or an ultrasound showing curvilinear gas shadowing in the gallbladder.

Crepitus in the abdominal wall adjacent to the gallbladder is occasionally detectable, but peritoneal signs are absent. Complications include gangrene and perforation. If perforation occurs, the abdominal pain is relieved but peritonitis results.\nDiagnosis is confirmed with an abdominal radiograph demonstrating air fluid levels in the gallbladder or an ultrasound showing curvilinear gas shadowing in the gallbladder. CT scan may be of help in confirming the diagnosis if other imaging modalities are unclear. Laboratory findings may include a mild to moderate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or a small elevation in aminotransferases.\nTreatment includes immediate fluid and electrolyte resuscitation, early cholecystectomy, and parenteral antibiotic therapy that is effective against the gram-positive anaerobic Clostridium sp. (ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, or the combination of an aminoglycoside or quinolone with clindamycin or metronidazole).\n(Choice A) Abdominal ultrasound would demonstrate gallstones in a patient with acute calculous cholecystitis. Moreover, air fluid levels or gas shadowing in the gallbladder would not be evident.\n(Choice B) Acute pancreatitis is most commonly associated with alcohol intake or gallstones, neither of which is present in this patient. Moreover air fluid levels or gas shadowing in the gallbladder would not be evident.\n(Choice C) Peptic ulcer perforation would be associated with free air under the diaphragm, not air fluid levels or gas shadowing in the gallbladder.\n(Choice E) Acute cholangitis is an infection of the biliary tract characterized by high fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain (Charcot's triad). The condition arises due to biliary tract obstruction and a resultant bacterial contamination of the bile. Common causes of biliary tract obstruction include choledocholithiasis, biliary tract manipulations/stenting, and hepatobiliary malignancies. Alkaline phosphatase and the white blood count are also often markedly elevated in this patient population.\nEducational Objective:\nEmphysematous cholecystitis is a common form of acute cholecystitis in elderly diabetic males It arises due to infection of the gallbladder wall with gas-forming bacteria."

    "question": "A 51-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of renal failure. His past medical history is significant\nfor recurrent episodes of bilateral flank pain over the past several years as well as nocturia 2 to 3 times per\nnight for the past 10 years. He has no weight loss. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 160/100\nmm Hg. His mucous membranes are pale. There is a palpable mass located at the right flank. Which of the\nfollowing is the mast likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Horseshoe kidney",
      "B. Nephrolithiasis",
      "C. Papillary necrosis",
      "D. Polycystic kidney disease",
      "E. Renal cell carcinoma"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This man most likely has autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). ADPKD is one of the most common hereditary diseases in the United States and accounts for 10% of dialysis patients. Patients will often have hypertension and palpable kidneys on exam. Pallor indicates anemia from chronic renal failure.\n(Choice A) Horseshoe kidney is a congenital abnormality that can cause complications such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction, renal stones, vesicoureteric reflux, and chronic urinary tract infections. Horseshoe kidney does not typically cause pain and would not be palpable on physical examination.\n(Choice B) Nephrolithiasis is a common complication of PKD, occurring in 20% of affected patients. It can cause pain but would not produce a palpable renal mass unless it has caused severe hydronephrosis. Severe hydronephrosis usually causes acute renal failure, whereas the abnormalities in the patient described above have been more chronic in nature.\n(Choice C) Papillary necrosis refers to ischemic necrosis in the renal papillae. Analgesic overuse is the most common cause, but diabetes mellitus, infections, urinary tract obstruction, hemoglobinopathies, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, shock, and hemophilia can also be associated. There would not be a palpable mass on physical examination.\n(Choice E) Renal cell carcinoma does not seem to occur with increased frequency in patients with APKD when compared to the general population. Also, it is less likely given no other symptoms such as weight loss or loss of appetite. RCC alone would not give renal failure.\nEducational objective:\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a heritable form of renal disease characterized by multiple renal cysts and intermittent flank pain, hematuria, urinary tract infections, and nephrolithiasis."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Treatment of hyperkalemia depends on the cause and rapidity of rise of serum potassium levels. The available options are calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, insulin drip with dextrose, diuretics, cation exchange resins, beta agonist inhalations, and dialysis.\nOf all the available options, removal of K+ can be achieved using diuretics, cation-exchange resin, or dialysis. Kayexalate, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation-exchange resin which acts in the GI tract by promoting the exchange of Na+ for K+, and thereby increasing the excretion of K+.\n(Choices A, B and E) Sodium bicarbonate, insulin plus dextrose drip and beta-agonist decrease the extra cellular concentration of potassium by driving the potassium into the cell, however they do not remove potassium from the body.\n(Choice C) Calcium acts by antagonizing the membrane effect of hyperkalemia especially on cardiac tissue, however it has no effect on potassium concentration.\nEducational Objective:\nIn hyperkalemia, removal of K+ from the body can be achieved with dialysis, cation exchange resins or diuretics."

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "HIV is characterized by several forms of kidney damage. The classic and most common one is collapsing focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Another name for this disease is HIV-related nephropathy. Typical presentation of the disease includes heavy proteinuria with rapid development of renal failure. It is interesting that focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can be manifested even if all the markers of HIV (CD4 count, viral load) are normal. For an unknown reason, the disease is more prevalent among blacks than among other ethnic groups.\n(Choices A, B and D) Other forms of HIV-related glomerulopathies that can present with nephritic-range proteinuria are membranous glomerulonephritis, often seen if they also have hepatitis-B infection, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. They are less common than focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\n(Choice E) Interstitial nephritis can occur during HIV, but the clinical scenario described (e.g., nephritic-range proteinuria) is unusual for interstitial nephritis.\nEducational Objective:\nCollapsing focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis is the most common form of glomerulopathy associated with HIV. Typical presentation of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis includes nephritic range proteinuria, azotemia, and normal sized kidneys."

      "B. Positive for nitrites anly",
      "C. Positive for esterase only",
      "D. Negative far both esterase and nitrites"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Dipsticks are commercially available kits that detect the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrites in the urine of patients with suspected UTI. Leukocyte esterase in the urine indicates significant pyuria, whereas nitrites signify the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, which converts urinary nitrates to nitrites. (Remember, though, that the most likely responsible organism of UTI is E. coli.) The advent of dipstick testing has significantly reduced the cost associated with urine culture; however, dipsticks are associated with a high false positive rate and high false negative rate. For this reason, a negative dipstick test in a patient with symptoms of UTI should still have urine cultures done.\nIn this case, the patient's clinical presentation (i.e., pyuria, significant bacteriuria) is highly suggestive of acute pyelonephritis. The expected dipstick finding is positive for both nitrites and esterase.\nEducational Objective:\nDipsticks are commercially available kits that detect the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite in the urine of patients with suspected UTI. Positive leukocyte esterase signifies significant pyuria and positive nitrites indicate the presence of Enterobacteriaceae."

    "options": ["A. Hypertension", "B. Diabetes mellitus", "C.Parapratein"],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation of this patient is suggestive of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma (plasma cell myeloma, myelomatosis, Kahler's disease) is characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells, resulting in excessive production of a single immunoglobulin type (monoclonal paraproteins). It is most commonly seen in the elderly (median age of 65), and is characterized by normochromic normocytic anemia, fatigue, and bone pain (especially in the back and chest). Labs show anemia (Hb=12), hypercalcemia, Bence Jones proteins in the urine, and a monoclonal protein peak on electrophoresis. X-rays may reveal punched out lesions, osteoporosis, or pathologic fractures.\nApproximately 50% of multiple myeloma patients develop some degree of renal insufficiency along the course of their disease. This is most likely due to obstruction of the distal and collecting tubules by large laminated casts containing paraproteins (mainly Bence Jones proteins). Hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, amyloid deposition and pyelonephritis may occur with multiple myeloma and contribute to renal insufficiency. Acute renal failure may also be precipitated after an infection, dehydration, and the use of IV dye.\n(Choice A) Hypercalcemia usually does not occur in patients with hypertension-related renal failure.\n(Choice B) Diabetic nephropathy usually occurs after 10-15 years of having diabetes mellitus.\n(Choice D) Primary hyperparathyroidism can also cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to dehydration (from polyuria) and subsequent acute renal failure; however, decreased serum phosphorus levels are also seen with this condition. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can occur in patients with renal failure due to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Multiple myeloma thus remains as the most likely cause of this patient's hypercalcemia.\nEducational Objective:\nAny elderly patient with bone pain, renal failure, and hypercalcemia has multiple myeloma until proven otherwise. Approximately 50% of multiple myeloma patients develop some degree of renal insufficiency; this is most likely due to obstruction of the distal and collecting tubules by large laminated casts containing paraproteins (mainly Bence Jones protein)."

    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "Blood at the beginning of urination (initial hematuria) typically indicates a lesion in the urethra such as urethritis. Hematuria at the end of voiding, called terminal hematuria, often suggests a prostatic or bladder cause. Hematuria during the entire urinary cycle (total hematuria) may indicate disease within the ureters or kidneys. A renal cause of hematuria will not show clots. This patient has painless terminal hematuria with clots and should be evaluated for bladder cancer by cystoscopy.\n(Choice A) Glomerular diseases can cause nephritic syndrome and microscopic or gross hematuria. Patients can present with total hematuria without clots.\n(Choice B) Urinary tract stones are an important cause of hematuria. However, nephrolithiasis is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient as he is not experiencing any pain.\n(Choice C) A urinary tract infection (UTI) usually presents with dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary hesitancy, though microscopic or gross hematuria may be present as well.\n(Choice E) Polycystic kidney disease is the leading heritable cause of renal disease in adults.

    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient has a history of diabetes mellitus for the past 20 years, and has developed peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and gastropathy. His current complaint of urinary incontinence is most likely related to his diabetic condition as well, particularly diabetic autonomic neuropathy with detrusor weakness.\nDiabetic autonomic neuropathy leads to a denervated bladder, which results in urinary retention. The acontractile, hypotonic bladder gradually overdistends, and when the bladder pressure rises above the urethral pressure, urine is lost until the pressure equalizes. These events occur in a cyclic manner, thus explaining why the incontinence occurs during both day and night. Physical examination may reveal a distended bladder. Post-void residual urine volumes are high. Aside from strict glycemic control, treatment options include intermittent catheterization and cholinergic medications such as bethanechol. Heavy alcohol intake may contribute to the effects of autonomic neuropathy; therefore, advising this patient to stop drinking alcoholic beverages may be helpful.\n(Choice C) The patient has a normal sized prostate; therefore, overflow incontinence due to bladder outlet obstruction is unlikely.\n(Choice E) Overflow incontinence due to medication is usually seen with the use of anticholinergics, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and sedative-hypnotics.\n(Choice I) Pelvic floor weakness is a common cause of stress incontinence in women, although it may occur in older men after a radical or transurethral prostatectomy. This condition is characterized by a normal post-void residual volume.\n(Choice J) This patient's urinalysis also suggests the presence of diabetic nephropathy; however, his urinary symptoms are better explained by diabetic neuropathy, rather than nephropathy or other disorders.\nEducational Objective:\nAutonomic neuropathy may lead to a denervated bladder resulting in overflow incontinence. This condition is characterized by a high post-void residual volume."

      "D. lt responds well to beta blockers.",
      "E. It usually starts in the peripheral part of the prostate."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is clinically characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms (increased frequency, urgency, weak stream, nocturia) and a sense of incomplete voiding. The mechanisms of BPH are unknown; however, it has been established that unlike prostate cancer, BPH starts in the center of the prostate.\nThe enlarged prostate is palpated during digital rectal examination, and the bladder obstruction is visualized during cystoscopy. Medical treatment with alpha-blockers is usually the initial treatment of choice. For severe cases, surgery (TURP) may be offered. All patients with significant bladder outlet obstruction should have a Foley catheter placed. Prolonged obstruction of more than two weeks duration can result in permanent kidney damage. In elderly patients, bladder outlet obstruction is one of the most common causes of acute renal failure (another common cause is prerenal azotemia secondary to dehydration). For these reasons, all elderly patients who present with acute renal failure should have a Foley catheter placed as a first step; if a large amount of urine is collected after inserting the catheter, BPH is the most likely diagnosis. Ultrasound of the kidneys, ureter and bladder can also identify hydronephrosis, which is typically bilateral in nature.\n(Choice A) Although patients with bladder outlet obstruction are more likely to develop urinary tract infection, prophylactic antibiotic therapy is not routinely recommended. This patient's urine culture is negative; therefore, antibiotics are not indicated.\n(Choice C) In chronic, severe BPH, the hypertrophied prostate causes resistance to urine flow. In such cases, it can be difficult to insert a Foley catheter through the hypertrophied prostate. Sometimes, when the Foley catheter cannot be placed, a suprapubic catheter is required, but remember that this is a treatment of last resort.\n(Choice D) Beta-blockers have no value in the treatment of BPH. The drugs of choice are alpha-adrenergic blockers.\nEducational Objective:\nThe symptoms of BPH are weak urinary stream, urgency, frequency, and sensation of incomplete voiding. Unlike prostate cancer, BPH starts in the center of the prostate. Placement of a Foley catheter is the most appropriate initial step in patients who present with acute renal failure. The obstruction should be reversed within the first two weeks to prevent permanent kidney damage."

    "explanation": "This diabetic patient gives a classic clinical presentation of community acquired pneumonia. His low blood pressure, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, high Hb level, and elevated BUN suggest that he is dehydrated as a result of his infection. The BUN/creatinine ratio is =20, consistent with a pre-renal cause (i.e. dehydration) of his azotemia. This patient is likely to improve with intravenous fluids and antibiotic therapy. However, his renal failure may worsen if his pneumonia progresses to sepsis. Because metformin is known to cause lactic acidosis, and because this effect is potentiated by renal failure, metformin should be discontinued in this patient until his renal function improves.\n(Choice A) Adding an ACE inhibitor would likely make this patient more hypotensive and could worsen his renal failure.\n(Choice B) Rosiglitazone is metabolized extensively by the liver cytochrome P450 system and is eliminated independent of renal function. It is contraindicated in liver failure but does not need to be discontinued in this patient.\n(Choice D) Glipizide is a short-acting hypoglycemic medication that can be given safely to a patient with renal failure because it is metabolized and eliminated through the liver. Longer-acting hypoglycemic agents like glyburide should be used with caution in renal failure patients because they can accumulate and cause hypoglycemia.\n(Choice E and F) This patient's high hemoglobin level is most likely due to dehydration (relative polycythemia), and should correct with hydration. The same applies for his borderline hypercalcemia.\nEducational Objective:\nMetformin should not be given to patients with renal failure, hepatic failure or sepsis, as these conditions all worsen a patient's lactic acidosis."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman complains of fatigue, low-grade fevers, anorexia, headaches and skin rash aver the\npast several weeks. She alsa notes new exertional dyspnea and an unintentional &§ pound weight gain aver\nthe past two weeks. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 190/110 mmHg and her heart rate is\n90/min. Which of the following is the most likely finding an this patient's urinary tests?",
    "options": [
      "A. High VMA excretion",
      "B. High daily cortisol excretion",
      "C. Red blood cells",
      "D. Glucosuria",
      "E. Uric acid crystals"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has nephritic syndrome due to acute glomerulonephritis. Nephritic syndrome is characterized by dependent edema, hypertension, and hematuria with or without dysmorphic red blood cells or red blood cell casts. Rash and low-grade fevers may be present. Hypertension is due to volume overload rather than vasoactive substances such as angiotensin II. Urinalysis will reveal red blood cells with or without casts. Proteinuria may be mild to profound depending upon the underlying etiology of the disease. Biopsy should be pursued to clarify the exact type of glomerulonephritis present.\n(Choice A) High urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) excretion is seen in pheochromocytoma. The classic symptom triad in pheochromocytoma is: episodic headaches, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Edema, fever and skin rash are not common.\n(Choice B) Urinary cortisol excretion is elevated in Cushing's syndrome, but fever and skin rash are not seen.\n(Choice D) Glucosuria is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus but is not typically seen in nephritic syndrome.\n(Choice E) Uric acid crystals may be observed in gout nephropathy and tumor lysis syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nNephritic syndrome is characterized by dependent edema, hypertension, and hematuria (dysmorphic red blood cells or red blood cell casts). Rash, low-grade fevers and proteinuria may also be present."

    "question": "A 70-year-old man comes to the physician because of nocturia. He states that over the past two years his\nurinary frequency has increased and he has to strain while passing urine. He alsa notes dribbling of a few\ndrops of urine at the end of voiding. Sometimes he has to void again within two hours. He has no other\nsymptoms. He has no history of diabetes mellitus, stroke or trauma. He does not take any medication. His\nfather had surgery of the prostate far benign prostatic hyperplasia. He has a 15-pack-years history of\ncigarette smoking. Rectal examination shows smoath, firm enlargement of the prostate with no\ninduration. Meurological examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory study shows a serum creatinine of\n0.7 mg/dL. Which of the following studies is indicated at this time?",
    "options": [
      "A. Blood urea nitrogen",
      "B. Ultrasound of kidney, bladder and ureter",
      "C. Intravenous pyelagram",
      "D. Serum prostate specific antigen",
      "E. Cystoscopy",
      "F. Urinalysis"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "The above patient is most likely suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). All patients with irritative or obstructive voiding symptoms should have their urinalysis and serum creatinine done; as such symptoms are not always due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Such symptoms may be produced by multiple causes like benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, urethral stricture, neurogenic bladder and urinary tract infections. Urinalysis helps to rule out urinary tract infection and serum creatinine detects renal insufficiency that might be due to bladder outlet obstruction. Serum creatinine is a better index of renal function than blood urea nitrogen and therefore is the preferred test. The two initial tests, which are recommended in all the patients with possible BPH, are serum creatinine and urinalysis. Urine culture will be considered only when urinalysis is positive for infection.\nSerum PSA is considered to be optional in the patients suspected of having benign prostatic hyperplasia. Serum PSA increases the probability to detect cancer of the prostate when it is combined with digital rectal examination, however there is a considerable overlap of serum PSA levels in benign disease and cancer of the prostate (Choice D).\n(Choices B and C) Ultrasound or IVP are not the initial tests and they are indicated only when there is a coexistent urinary tract disease or any complication of benign prostatic hyperplasia. These indications are hematuria, renal insufficiency, and history of stones or urinary tract infection.\n(Choice E) Cystoscopy is performed when invasive treatment is being considered and it helps to determine the surgical approach.\nCystometrogram is indicated when neurological disease is being considered or when a patient with BPH fails to improve after prostate surgery.\nEducational Objective:\nThe two initial tests, which are recommended in all the patients with possible benign prostatic hyperplasia, are serum creatinine and urinalysis."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The classic signs of dehydration are described in this case. These include: altered mental status, dry oral mucosa, marginally high values of serum electrolytes and hematocrit, and a BUN/creatinine ratio more than 20. Elderly patients are especially prone to dehydration after various or even minor insults (a minor febrile illness, in this case). The predisposing factors of elderly patients to dehydration include: decreased thirst response to dehydration, impaired renal sodium conservation, and impaired renal concentration ability. The mainstay of treatment is administration of intravenous sodium-containing crystalloid solutions. Rehydration therapy in elderly patients should be undertaken with caution because sodium loading can unmask subclinical heart failure.\n(Choice A) Colloid solutions (e.g., albumin) are usually used in burns or conditions accompanied by hypoproteinemia.\n(Choice C) Packed red blood cells can be ordered in hemorrhagic situations.\n(Choice D) There is no indication to administer antibiotics in this case.\n(Choice E) Using diuretics in this patient is very dangerous.\n(Choice F) Renal ultrasound is indicated in patients with undiagnosed renal failure, such as possible hydronephrosis, etc. This might be useful in male patients who are at risk for urinary retention from prostatic hyperplasia. Urinary retention from outlet obstruction is very unlikely in female patients.\nEducational Objective:\nElderly patients are particularly predisposed to dehydration after even minor insults (e.g., a minor febrile illness). Know the classic signs of dehydration (i.e., dry mucosa, marginally high values for hematocrit and serum electrolytes, BUN/creatinine ratio = 20). The treatment is administration of intravenous sodium-containing crystalloid solutions (usually 0.9% NaCl = normal saline)."

      "D. Interstitial nephritis",
      "E. Urinary outflow obstruction",
      "F. Glomerulonephritis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has unilateral obstructive uropathy due to renal calculi. Indications that this is the case include his flank pain, which suggests renal capsular distension; his poor urine output, which suggests mechanical obstruction to urine outflow; his intermittent episodes of high volume urination, which can occur when an obstruction is overcome by a large volume of retained urine; and his renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.1 mg/dl), a reflection of pressure atrophy and decreased glomerular filtration secondary to prolonged obstruction. In this condition, urinalysis may show occasional RBCs and WBCs but no casts.\n(Choice A) Tumor lysis syndrome, for example in patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing chemotherapy, can precipitate renal failure secondary to large scale release of uric acid.\n(Choice B) Renal artery stenosis can cause hypertension with or without renal dysfunction. It does not cause flank pain or urinary symptoms, however.\n(Choice C) The leading cause of inherited renal disease is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Patients typically present with abdominal or flank pain and microscopic or gross hematuria. There is a positive family history in 75% of cases. Over half of patients have hypertension at presentation.\n(Choice D) Interstitial nephritis most frequently occurs as a drug reaction. Patients present with fever, rash, acute renal dysfunction, and eosinophiluria with white blood cell casts.\n(Choice F) Glomerulonephritis is relatively uncommon and presents with hematuria, red blood cell casts, acute renal failure, hypertension, and edema.\nEducational objective:\nObstructive uropathy causes flank pain, low volume voids with or without occasional high volume voids, and renal dysfunction."

      "A Restriction of calcium in her diet",
      "B. Thiazide diuretics",
      "C. Low dose furosemide",
      "D. High sodium intake",
      "E. Potassium citrate"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Approximately 1-5% of the United States population is affected by renal stones (nephrolithiasis). Men have twice the risk of women. The basic pathophysiology involves the abnormal excretion of stone-forming salts and/or a deficiency of urinary inhibitors of crystal formation due to metabolic disorders or dietary factors.\nRenal stones are predominantly of four types:\n1. Calcium oxalate/phosphate (75%)\n2 Uric acid (10-15%)\n3. Struvite/triple phosphate (10-15%)\n4. Cysteine (<1%)\nCalcium stones are the most common type of renal stones seen. These are most commonly seen in the third or fourth decade of life. Most patients present with hypercalciuria (24 hour urinary calcium excretion = 300 mg in males and 250 mg in females; = 4 mg/kg in both males and females).\nThe most common causes of calcium stones are:\n1. Idiopathic hypercalciuria: This is the most common cause and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Urinary calcium excretion is high, but serum calcium levels are normal. The etiology is unclear, but possibilities include increased intestinal absorption of calcium, decreased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium, and increased calcium release from bone.\n2 Hyperuricosuria\n3. Hyperoxaluria: The cause may be hereditary, dietary (i.e. due to ingestion of a large amount of vitamin C or green leafy vegetables), or secondary to IBD or short bowel syndrome.\n4. Decreased urinary citrate\n5. Renal tubular acidosis: Typically, nephrocalcinosis is seen.\n6. Chronic decrease in urine output: This helps the precipitation of calcium salts.\nThis patient most likely has recurrent hypercalciuric stones due to idiopathic hypercalciuria. This is best treated with increased fluid intake, dietary sodium restriction, and thiazide/amiloride diuretics. Thiazide diuretics decrease urinary calcium excretion (primarily by inducing mild volume depletion, which leads to a compensatory rise in proximal reabsorption of sodium and calcium) and prevent the precipitation of calcium in the urine. Patients with recurrent calcium stones due to hyperuricosuria can be treated with purine-restricted diet and allopurinol.\nRecommendations for calcium oxalate urolithiasis (in order of relative importance):\n1. Increased fluid intake (=3 L/dL)\n2. Normal or increased calcium diet (recommended daily allowance is 1000 mg/dL)\n3. Dietary sodium restriction (<100 mEq/dL)\n4. Oxalate restriction (i.e., dark roughage, chocolate, and vitamin C)\n5. Decreased dietary proteins (i.e., beef, fish, eggs, and poultry)\n(Choice C) Furosemide increases the urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria) and can thus predispose to calcium stone formation.\n(Choice D) High dietary sodium can worsen hypercalciuria; hence, sodium restriction is advised in patients with calcium stones.\n(Choice E) Oral citrate has not been proven to benefit patients with calcium stones, not even in patients with idiopathic hypocitraturia.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients with recurrent hypercalciuric renal stones should be treated with increased fluid intake, sodium restriction, and a thiazide diuretic. Calcium restriction is not advised. The treatment of a first uncomplicated calcium stone is hydration and observation."

      "E. Infection"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is cystinuria, which is actually a group of disorders characterized by impaired amino acid transport and several modes of inheritance. The problem lies with the defective transport of dibasic amino acids (cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine) by the brush borders of renal tubular and intestinal epithelial cells. Cystine is poorly soluble in water; this leads to the formation of hard, radioopaque renal stones.\nIn this case, the clues to the correct diagnosis are the patient's personal history of recurrent stones since childhood, positive family history, typical hexagonal crystals on urinalysis, and positive urinary cyanide nitroprusside test. The urinary cyanide nitroprusside test can detect elevated cystine levels, which can help confirm the diagnosis; this test is widely used as a qualitative screening procedure, and is particularly helpful for the detection of homozygotes.\n(Choice B) Primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma can lead to recurrent stones, but this patient's clinical scenario is more typical for cystinuria.\n(Choices C and D) Excessive uric acid excretion in the urine due to hyperuricemia and excessive intestinal reabsorption of oxalate due to intestinal diseases are other causes of nephrolithiasis, but are unlikely in this case.\n(Choice E) Infection with urease-producing microorganisms can result in struvite stone formation, but this is also less likely for this patient.\nEducational Objective:\nCystinuria is an inherited disease causing recurrent renal stone formation. Look for a personal history of recurrent kidney stones from childhood and a positive family history. The characteristic stones are hard and radioopaque. Urinalysis shows typical hexagonal crystals. The urinary cyanide nitroprusside test is widely used as a qualitative screening procedure."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "75% to 80% of kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate. Calcium oxalate crystals are envelope-shaped, and can be seen on microscopic examination of urine. Small bowel disease, surgical resection or chronic diarrhea can lead to malabsorption of fatty acids and bile salts; this predisposes to the formation of calcium oxalate stones. (Fat malabsorption leads to the increased absorption of oxalic acid because the unabsorbed fatty acids chelate calcium, making oxalic acid free for absorption.)\n(Choice B) Calcium phosphate stones are common in primary hyperparathyroidism and renal tubular acidosis.\n(Choice C) Uric acid stones are formed when the urine is acidic or when there is increased cell turnover, thereby resulting in hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria. Dehydration is another important risk factor.\n(Choice D) Cysteine stones are formed when there is increased excretion of cysteine, which is an inborn error of metabolism. A positive family history may be found in such cases.\n(Choice E) Struvite stones are formed when urine is alkaline because of infection with urease producing bacteria (e.g., Proteus). In such cases, a history of recurrent UTI may be present.\nEducational Objective:\nColicky flank pain with radiation to the groin indicates renal colic. 75% to 90% of the kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate. Small bowel disease, surgical resection or chronic diarrhea can lead to malabsorption of fatty acids and bile salts; this in turn predisposes to the formation calcium oxalate stones."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Nephrotoxicity is a well-known side effect of acyclovir therapy. Acyclovir is poorly soluble in urine and easily precipitates in renal tubules causing obstruction and acute renal failure. Crystalluria with renal tubular obstruction usually occurs during administration of large parenteral doses of acyclovir; inadequate hydration is a predisposing factor. The clinical presentation described is typical for acute renal failure: oliguria with elevated creatinine and BUN.\n(Choices A, C, D and E) Of course, other causes of acute renal failure should be considered, like prerenal azotemia and low obstruction, but they are less likely in this case. Glomerular injury and drug-induced interstitial nephritis are even more distant possibilities for the clinical scenario described.\nEducational Objective:\nAcyclovir can cause crystalluria with renal tubular obstruction during high-dose parenteral therapy, especially in inadequately hydrated patients."

Bacteria typically ascend the bladder and invade the ureters. In most cases, bacteria enter the blood stream and cause gram-negative sepsis. Complete blood count shows leukocytosis with left shift. Blood and urine cultures must be obtained before starting antibiotics in any patient who appears septic. Antibiotics active against gram-negative organisms such as ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone should be administered. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin is no longer the preferred therapy due to the increasing incidence of resistance to these antibiotics. Hypotensive patients require aggressive resuscitation with intravenous crystalloids, and in some cases, vasopressors.\n(Choice A) During an acute episode of pyelonephritis, an IVP is not recommended. IVP is done in chronic pyelonephritis where it will show an irregular border of the renal pelvis with cortical scars.\n(Choices D and E) CT scan or ultrasound may be obtained if the diagnosis is in doubt or if the acute episode of pyelonephritis does not respond to antibiotic therapy.\nEducational Objective:\nAcute pyelonephritis can potentially result in gram-negative sepsis.

Which of the following glomerulapathies is more likely to be present in this\npatient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis",
      "B. Membranous glomerulonephritis",
      "C. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis",
      "D. Minimal change disease",
      "E. Crescentic glomerulonephritis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Glomerular disease may be seen in patients with a wide variety of malignancies. Nephrotic syndrome presents as high-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminuria, and edema (as seen in this patient), and is a well-known complication of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma is minimal change disease. The pathophysiology of this condition is poorly understood, but lymphocyte dysregulation and cytokine production may play a role. Nephrotic syndrome usually resolves with successful treatment of the lymphoma.\n(Choice B) Glomerular disease is also often seen in patients with carcinomas of the lung, stomach, breast, and colon. In general, membranous nephropathy is the most common nephropathy associated with carcinoma.\n(Choices A, C and E) Other glomerulopathies such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, and crescentic glomerulonephritis are much less frequent in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nEducational Objective:\nIn general, membranous nephropathy is the most common nephropathy associated with carcinoma; however, nephrotic syndrome is a well-known complication of Hodgkin's lymphoma, and is usually caused by minimal change disease."

    "question": "A 65-year-old male has been having a non-productive, hacking cough for over a week. He takes an over-the-\ncounter medication containing guaifenesin and diphenhydramine in an effort to improve his symptoms. The\nnext day, he complains of lower abdominal discomfort and difficulty voiding. Which of the following most\nlikely accounts far this patient's new complaint?",
    "options": [
      "A. Detrusor inactivity",
      "B. Urethral obstruction",
      "C. Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia",
      "D. Overactive bladder",
      "E. Abdominal muscle weakness"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "First-generation H1-antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, doxepin and hydroxyzine have significant anticholinergic effects in addition to their antihistamine effects. The anticholinergic effects of these agents result from inhibition of the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors, which are found in the parasympathetic nervous system. Common anticholinergic side-effects include dryness of the eyes, oral mucosa and respiratory passages, urinary retention and dysuria. Urinary retention caused by anticholinergic agents results from failure of detrusor contraction. Detrusor activity is controlled by parasympathetic input from the pelvic splanchnic nerves.\n(Choice B) Urethral obstruction commonly occurs in older men in the setting of benign prostatic hypertrophy. This condition may also cause difficulty with establishing and maintaining a urinary stream, but these symptoms would have a more insidious onset. The patient described most likely has some component of BPH-related obstruction that has been worsened by anticholinergic-mediated detrusor inactivity.\n(Choice C) Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia typically occurs in the setting of neurologic disease. In this condition, the detrusor muscle contracts while the urethral sphincter contracts causing difficulty in initiating urination and inadvertent interruption of the urinary stream.\n(Choice D) Overactive bladder is clinically defined by symptoms of urgency, frequency and nocturia. Difficulty initiating urination is not a typical feature.\n(Choice E) While the abdominal musculature may be used in an accessory fashion to increase intraabdominal pressure and facilitate urination and defecation, a solitary defect in the strength of this musculature would be insufficient to cause urinary retention.\nEducational objective:\nFirst-generation H1-antihistamines have potent anticholinergic effects and may cause eye and oropharyngeal dryness as well as urinary retention, especially in older males who may have some underlying BPH."

Renal biopsy is performed. She is started on diuretics and her\nsalt and protein intake is restricted. Her edema begins to improve. However, the patient suddenly develops\nsevere abdominal pain, fever, and gross hematuria. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis that\nwill be revealed by renal biopsy?",
    "options": [
      "A. Minimal change disease",
      "B. Systemic amyloidosis",
      "C. Focal segmental glomerulosclerasis",
      "D. Membranaous glomerulonephritis",
      "E. Diabetic nephropathy"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Renal vein thrombosis is an important complication of nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin III is lost in the urine and puts patients at an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis. Renal vein thrombosis presents with sudden onset of abdominal pain, fever and hematuria. It can occur in any form of nephrotic syndrome, but it is most common with membranous glomerulonephritis, which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults (Choice D).\n(Choices A, B, C and E) Minimal change disease, systemic amyloidosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy can all cause nephrotic syndrome and subsequent renal vein thrombosis; however, this complication is less frequent with these disorders.\nEducational Objective:\nRenal vein thrombosis is an important complication of nephrotic syndrome, which is most commonly caused by membranous glomerulonephritis in adults."

    "question": "A 68-year-old male presents to the emergency room with cough. Chest x-ray is clear of infiltrates but reveals\na right upper lobe lung lesion incidentally. A chest CT scan with IV contrast is performed in the emergency\ndepartment and reveals a 1cm x 2cm round lesion in the right upper lobe. The patient is admitted ta the\nhospital, and by day 3 of his hospitalization, he has developed acute renal failure. The patient's past medical\nhistary is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and coronary artery disease. His medications\ninclude aspirin, hydrochlorathiazide, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin and lisinopril, all of which he has\nbeen taking for several years. He has no known drug allergies. He is a former smoker and does not use\nalcohal or drugs. His baseline blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg and has remained in the 140s/90s\nthroughout this admission. Physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. The patient's laboratory values\nfrom the time of admission to present are given below:\nAdmission Day?2         Day 3\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN)            16 mg/dL       22 mg/dL       28 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine                      15mgidl  18mg/dL 23 mg/dL\nOver the course of the next week, the patient's renal function returns to normal. Which of the following would\nmast likely have prevented his renal failure?",
    "options": [
      "A. Prednisone",
      "B. Furosemide",
      "C. Stopping clopidogrel",
      "D. Intravenous hydration"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient developed acute renal failure following CT contrast administration, consistent with contrast induced nephropathy. The pathogenesis of contrast-induced nephropathy involves renal vasoconstriction and tubular injury. Patients with a history of diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency (this patient's Cr was 1.5 on admission) are at increased risk of contrast nephropathy. The most common presentation is a spike in the creatinine within 24 hours of contrast administration, followed by a return to normal renal function within five days.\nAdequate pre-CT intravenous hydration is the single most important intervention for preventing contrast nephropathy. Isotonic bicarbonate is the IV fluid of choice, and administration should begin prior to the procedure and continue for several hours afterwards. Acetylcysteine has also been shown to prevent nephropathy, likely due to its vasodilatory and antioxidant properties.\n(Choice A) Prednisone can be used to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media in patients with known allergy. Allergic reactions to contrast include flushing, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, etc. Prednisone does not prevent contrast-induced nephropathy, however. In patients with renal insufficiency, prednisone can cause fluid retention. It can also cause blood pressure elevations.\n(Choice B) Diuretics do not prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. In fact, in one study, furosemide led to a slightly increased risk of contrast nephropathy.\n(Choice C) While it is generally advisable to discontinue NSAIDs prior to contrast administration (as NSAIDs cause renal vasoconstriction), it is not necessary to discontinue clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet agent which works by blocking ADP receptors.\n(Choice E) 100% oxygen administration has no role in preventing contrast nephropathy. Furthermore, while oxygen therapy can be of benefit in specific clinical situations, inappropriate administration of supplemental oxygen can lead to negative consequences.\nEducational Objective:\nContrast-induced nephropathy presents as a transient spike in creatinine within 24 hours of contrast administration, with a return to normal renal function within 5-7 days. Patients with diabetes and elevated baseline creatinine are at especially high risk. Adequate IV hydration with isotonic bicarbonate and administration of acetylcysteine help to minimize the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy."

He has been in a drug\nrehabilitation program for the past 2-months, for a long history of IV drug abuse. Examination shows\nsignificant ascites. Urinalysis shows proteinuria; 24-hr urinary protein excretion is 4g/day. Which of the\nfollowing is the mast likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Minimal change disease",
      "B. Systemic amyloidosis",
      "C. Focal segmental glomerulosclerasis",
      "D. Membranous glomerulonephritis",
      "E. IgA nephropathy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Nephrotic syndrome has many causes: minimal change disease; membranous nephropathy; focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; amyloidosis and diabetic nephropathy.\n(Choice A) Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents. It is either idiopathic or occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection. It can also occur in association with tumors.\n(Choice D) Membranous nephropathy may be primary or may be secondary due to HIV infection, autoimmune diseases and certain drugs like penicillamine and gold. Even though this is the most common cause of nephrotic range proteinuria in adults, this is unlikely in an obese, African American patient with a history of IV drug abuse.\n(Choice C) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in African American adults. It can be idiopathic or secondary to heroin use, HIV infection or morbid obesity. Therefore, any patient who has a history of IV drug abuse and nephrotic proteinuria is most likely to have FSGS.\n(Choice B) Amyloidosis may be primary or may be secondary to an inflammatory process. It is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome.\n(Choice E) IgA nephropathy causes a picture of nephritic syndrome with active urine sediment. It usually follows a recent upper respiratory tract infection.\nEducational Objective:\nKnow the different causes of nephrotic syndrome and their likelihood in a given patient. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in African American adults. It also occurs in patients with HIV and IV drug abuse."

    "question": "A 12-year-old girl is brought ta the clinic due to a Z-month history of headaches. Her headaches last 1-2\nhaurs and have no fixed time of occurrence. She denies nausea, vomiting, chills or fevers. She has no other\nmedical problems and takes no medication. Her family history is significant for hypertension and\ndiabetes. Her blood pressure is 156/30 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. Examination\nshows an alert child in no distress. There is a soft to-and-fro bruit heard at the right costovertebral\nangle. Which of the following is the mast likely cause of her hypertension?",
    "options": [
      "A. Coarctation of aorta",
      "B. Renal artery atherosclerosis",
      "C. Pheochromocytoma",
      "D. Fibromuscular dysplasia",
      "E. Conn's syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The most common cause of secondary hypertension in children is fibromuscular dysplasia. It is responsible for approximately 20% of all cases of renal hypertension. Aside from children, fibromuscular dysplasia is also generally seen in premenopausal women (or women less than 50 years old). Physical examination reveals a hum or bruit in the costovertebral angle due to well-developed collaterals. The right renal artery is more affected than the left. Angiography typically shows a \"string of beads\" pattern to the renal artery.\n(Choice A) Coarctation generally presents as upper extremity hypertension with absent or diminished pulses in the lower extremities. The narrowing is usually just distal to the left subclavian artery. Late systolic murmurs from collaterals may be heard in the back. Chest-x ray may show rib notching from collateral development.\n(Choice B) Renal artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis is generally seen in older patients (>50 years and common in males). It is often a segmental defect in the proximal renal artery. The stenosis is more common on the left. Bruits may be heard, but are generally unrelated to the renal artery stenosis.\n(Choice C) Pheochromocytoma is due to catecholamine-secreting tumors of the adrenals. It can present with paroxysms of headache, sweating and palpitations. Elevated urinary catecholamines are diagnostic. Bruits are not heard in patients with this condition.\n(Choice E) Conn's syndrome is due to an aldosterone-secreting adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. It usually presents in older patients as hypokalemia and hypertension.\nEducational Objective:\nFibromuscular dysplasia can present as new onset hypertension in children. Bruit or venous hum may be heard at the costovertebral angle. Angiogram reveals the \"string of beads” sign."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man is brought ta the emergency department due to the sudden onset of weakness. He was\nlying on the floor for several hours before he was brought in. His other medical problems include\nhypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attacks and osteoarthritis. CT\nscan af the head shows evidence of a right middle cerebral artery territory stroke.

      "A. Insulin with dextrose",
      "B. Kayexalate",
      "C. Sodium bicarbonate",
      "OD. Calcium glucanate"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of hyperkalemia that is most probably due to rhabdomyolysis. His EKG findings (i.e., tall T waves) indicate cardiotoxicity, which requires immediate intervention with calcium gluconate. Calcium acts by quickly antagonizing the membrane effect of hyperkalemia.\n(Choices A, B and E) Agents such as insulin with glucose and kayexalate should be given after the administration of calcium gluconate. It should be noted that these drugs have no cardioprotective action, which is why these are not the first-line agents for symptomatic hyperkalemia with EKG changes. Insulin drives potassium into the cells, thereby decreasing the extra-cellular concentration of potassium; it is given with glucose to prevent hypoglycemia. Kayexalate is a cation exchange resin that takes up potassium in the gut and releases sodium, thus increasing K+ excretion; it usually takes at least 6-12 hours to be effective.\n(Choice C) Acidosis can cause hyperkalemia by driving H+ into the cell in exchange for K+; therefore, sodium bicarbonate is the treatment option for hyperkalemia secondary to metabolic acidosis (e.g., patients with renal failure). Sodium bicarbonate also has no cardioprotective action, and should be used only after the administration of calcium gluconate.\nEducational Objective:\nCalcium gluconate is the most appropriate initial treatment for hyperkalemic patients with significant EKG abnormalities."

    "question": "A 50-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine check up. He has no present complaints. He has\ndiabetes mellitus, type 2, stable angina, and gout. He takes glyburide and atenolol. He smokes two packs a\nday and, occasionally, consumes alcohal. His father had an early myocardial infarction; his brother has\ndiabetes mellitus. His blood pressure is 140/30 mm Hg and heart rate is 65/min. Physical examination\nshows no abnormalities. There is concern about end organ damage in this patient due to diabetes\nmellitus. Which of the following is the earliest renal abnormality that could be seen in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Modular sclerosis",
      "B. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening",
      "C. Mesangial expansion",
      "D. Immune deposits",
      "E. Glomerular hyperfiltration"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Glomerular hyperfiltration is believed to be the earliest renal abnormality present in patients with diabetes mellitus. It can be detected as early as several days after the diagnosis of diabetes was made. Moreover, glomerular hyperfiltration is the major pathophysiologic mechanism of glomerular injury in these patients. It creates intraglomerular hypertension leading to progressive glomerular damage and renal function loss. You should remember that effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy is related to their ability to reduce intraglomerular hypertension and, thereby, decrease glomerular damage.\n(Choices A, B and C) Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is the first change that can be quantitated. This is followed by mesangial expansion. Nodular sclerosis is superimposed later and is specific for diabetic nephropathy.\n(Choice D) Immune deposits are not characteristic for diabetic nephropathy.\nEducational Objective:\nGlomerular hyperfiltration is the earliest renal abnormality seen in diabetic nephropathy. It is also the major pathophysiologic mechanism of glomerular injury in these patients. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane is the first change that can be quantitated."

    "question": "A 5%year-old man comes to the physician because of dysuria, urinary urgency, and frequency. He also\ncomplains of hematuria, nocturia, decreased force of stream, and a feeling of incomplete vaiding. These\nsymptoms have been present for more than a month. For the past few days he has been experiencing dull,\nnon-radiating suprapubic pain. He has also been having low-grade fever and malaise for the past couple of\ndays. He has been taking analgesics for osteoarthritis of his right knee for mare than 10 years. He has a 40-\npack-years history of cigarette smoking and does not use alcohal or drugs. Rectal examination shows a\nsmaoth, firm enlargement of the prostate without induration or asymmetry. Neurological examination shows\nno abnormalities. Urinalysis shows hematuria with isomorphic red blood cells. Laboratory studies show a\nserum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and a PSA of 2 ng/mL. Which of the following is the most likely explanation\nfor this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Benign prostatic hyperplasia",
      "B. Carcinoma of bladder",
      "C. Carcinoma of prostate",
      "D. Urethral stricture",
      "E. Meurogenic bladder"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The above patient has presented with irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms. Such symptoms may be produced by multiple causes like benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, urethral stricture, neurogenic bladder and urinary tract infections. Therefore, in all such patients, careful history, examination and certain lab tests should be performed to find out the exact cause of voiding complaints.\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia can produce both irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms, but presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia is poorly correlated with voiding symptoms. Presence of a firm, enlarged prostate on rectal examination does not always mean that voiding symptoms are due to an enlarged prostate as most patients with prostate enlargement are asymptomatic. Therefore, all the other causes should be ruled out before attributing symptoms to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia usually do not have hematuria, suprapubic pain and systemic features (Choice A).\nPresence of hematuria with irritative or voiding symptoms should alarm the physician to the possibility of bladder cancer. Bladder stones may also produce hematuria. Presence of suprapubic pain may also occur with bladder cancer. If bladder cancer is advanced, it may produce suprapubic pain due to involvement of perivesical nerves or due to obstruction of bladder outlet and urinary retention. Systemic features appear when bladder cancer is advanced or metastatic. This patient has a long history of analgesic use that is a risk factor for the development of bladder cancer. Cigarette smoking is another risk factor. Based on all these findings, this patient is most likely suffering from bladder cancer (Choice B).\n(Choice C) Patients with prostate cancer have induration of their gland on rectal examination and PSA is greater than 4 ng/ml in such patients.\n(Choice D) Patients with urethral stricture usually give a history of urethral trauma or urethral instrumentation. Hematuria is unlikely in stricture.\n(Choice E) Patients with neurogenic bladder have abnormal neurological examination. There may be a history of neuralogical disease, diabetes, stroke or back injury.\nEducational Objective:\nPresence of hematuria in a patient with irritative or obstructive voiding should alert the physician to the possibility of bladder cancer."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The most common cause of incontinence in older men is bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostate hypertrophy or carcinoma of the prostate. Patients commonly present with post-voidal dribbling, poor stream of urine, hesitancy, urgency, nocturia and urinary retention. Rectal examination shows the enlarged prostate. The post-void residual volume is high. Definitive treatment is by surgery.\n(Choice A) Urinary tract infection usually presents with dysuria, frequency and hematuria. Urinalysis shows evidence of infection. Post-void residual volume will be low or normal, as frequent emptying of the bladder occurs with this condition.\n(Choice C) Carcinoma of the prostate, not the bladder, can commonly cause urinary incontinence.\n(Choice D) Overflow incontinence from an acontractile bladder is usually due to diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, anesthetic blocks, and drugs such as anticholinergics. Multiple sclerosis is usually seen in females of child-bearing age. This is a very unlikely presentation in this patient, especially with a normal neurological exam. Isolated absence of ankle reflexes can be present in elderly patients and has no significance.\n(Choice E) Urinary fistula results in patients with a history of pelvic surgery or irradiation. Urine is lost continuously through the fistula. The diagnosis is made with intravenous pyelography, which shows that the dye is leaking from the fistula.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most common cause of overflow incontinence in elderly males is an enlarged prostate, which is usually revealed by rectal examination, and is characterized by a high post-void residual volume."

      "E. Aggressive intravenous hydration"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The acute elevation of this patient's serum creatinine is most likely secondary to acyclovir nephrotoxicity, a phenomenon that occurs in 5-10% of patients who receive the drug intravenously. Acyclovir is excreted principally in the urine via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. When the acyclovir concentration in the collecting duct exceeds its solubility, crystallization, crystalluria, and renal tubular damage may result. In most cases, this toxic complication is transient and can be prevented (as well as treated) with adequate hydration and dosage adjustment, which includes slowing the rate of intravenous infusion.\n(Choice A) Allergic reaction is not the most common cause of acyclovir-induced renal failure.\n(Choice B) Monitoring of acyclovir blood levels is not always effective in preventing nephrotoxicity. During states of low intravascular volume (eg, dehydration), nephrotoxicity can develop secondary to drug crystallization within the collecting duct even when acyclovir blood levels are not within the established toxic range.\n(Choice C) Allopurinol pre-treatment may be used in lymphoma and leukemia to prevent tumor lysis-associated urate crystal nephropathy.\n(Choice D) Pre-treatment with prednisone may be used to minimize radiocontrast-induced allergic reactions.\nEducational Objective:\nAcyclovir can cause crystalline nephropathy if adequate hydration is not also provided."

Drug-induced interstitial nephritis occurs with many drugs such as penicillins, cephalosporins and sulfonamides. Clinical features include fever, rash and arthralgias. Other features are peripheral eosinophilia, hematuria, sterile pyuria and eosinophiluria. WBC casts may be present in the urine, but red cell casts are rare. Discontinuing the offending agent is the treatment of drug-induced interstitial nephritis.\n(Choice D) Steroids may hasten recovery in cases of drug-induced interstitial nephritis but they may aggravate the underlying infection.\n(Choice C) Oral ciprofloxacin or IV ampicillin and gentamicin are used to treat acute pyelonephritis.\nEducational Objective:\n70% of cases with interstitial nephritis are caused by drugs such as cephalosporins, penicillins, sulfonamides, sulfonamide containing diuretics, NSAIDs, rifampin, phenytoin, and allopurinol. Discontinuing the offending agent is the treatment of drug-induced interstitial nephritis."

    "question": "A 36-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of excruciating flank pain. The pain\nradiates to the groin. His temperature is 36.9C(98.5F) blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min,\nand respirations are 14/min. Urinalysis shows six RBCs/HPF. Laboratory studies show BUN of 12mg/dL\nand serum creatinine of 0 9mg/dL. X-ray film of the abdomen shows nephrocalcinosis and IVP shows\nmultiple contrast filled cysts. Ultrasonagram of the kidneys is unremarkable. Which of the following is the\nmast likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Medullary cystic kidney",
      "B. Hydronephrasis",
      "C. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease",
      "D. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease",
      "E. Acquired cystic kidney disease"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The clinical picture presented in this question is typical of medullary cystic kidney (Choice A). This disease presents in adults with stone formation or is found incidentally on abdominal radiography as nephrocalcinosis. IVP shows typical radial arrangement of contrast filled cysts. This disease is not associated with renal failure or hypertension. These patients are usually asymptomatic initially; later they develop UTI and renal stones. Patients become symptomatic anytime during the ages of 20-50. Medullary cystic disease is autosomal dominant whereas the juvenile form, also known as nephronophthisis is autosomal recessive. There is no therapy to prevent the disease progression but in most patients the cysts are small and have no harmful effects. Renal stones are managed in the same manner as you would in a patient without medullary cystic kidney. These patients must take adequate salt and water to replenish the renal losses. Periodic screening is required for renal stones, hematuria, and UTI. Patients with medullary cystic disease and hemi-hypertrophy should be screened for cancer.\n(Choice B) Hydronephrosis is different from cystic disease. They usually do not have nephrocalcinosis.\n(Choice C) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease usually presents in adults between 30-50 years old, with pain and hematuria. Hypertension is also a common finding. Ultrasound is diagnostic. Without these features, this diagnosis is very unlikely in our patient.\n(Choice D) Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease presents in neonates or children as abdominal mass, renal failure, or failure to thrive.\n(Choice E) Acquired cystic kidney disease usually develops in patients with end stage renal disease undergoing dialysis.\nEducational Objective:\nSuspect medullary cystic disease in adults with recurrent UTI or renal stones and contrast filled cysts demonstrated by IVP."

    "question": "An 80-year-old female is brought fram a nursing home with a two day history of poor oral intake and\nlethargy. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease\nwith coranary stenting two years ago and Alzheimer's disease. She was hospitalized six months ago with\npneumaonia. Her current medications are aspirin, lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin and\nmemantine. Her blood pressure is 95/60 mmHg and heart rate is 30/min. Physical examination reveals fine\ncrackles at the right lung base. Her mucous membranes are dry. Her laboratary findings are significant for\nWBC of 15,000/mm3, creatinine of 2.1 and BUN of 61 mg/dl. Her creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl during the last\nadmission. Which of the following is the best explanation for the abnormal laboratary findings in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Age-related renal function decline",
      "B. Renal inflammatary infiltration",
      "C. Renal tubular dysfunction",
      "D. Renal vasoconstriction",
      "E. Obstructive uropathy",
      "F. Nodular glomerulosclerosis",
      "G. Hypertensive arteriolosclerosis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering from prerenal azotemia (prerenal ARF). Prerenal azotemia refers to acute renal insufficiency resulting from insufficient arterial perfusion of the kidney. In this case, the decreased perfusion is most likely the result of dehydration caused by poor oral intake of fluids. Prerenal azotemia due to intravascular volume depletion is rapidly reversible with intravenous volume resuscitation, but persistent untreated renal hypoperfusion will lead ultimately to intrinsic renal failure due to ischemia. The elderly, who have a diminished thirst response and a reduced ability to self-administer fluids, are at the greatest risk of prerenal azotemia. The risk of this condition is worsened when patients are treated with pharmacologic agents, such as NSAIDS diuretics and ACE inhibitors, which can blunt the renal response to low intravascular volume. Physical examination findings consistent with dehydration include relative hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor and slow capillary refill. Laboratory values reflect hemoconcentration and an increased serum BUN/Cr ratio.\n(Choice A) Age-related renal functional decline causes a slow decrease in the GFR due to loss of renal mass and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. It would not be expected to cause an acute or abrupt change in renal function.\n(Choice B) Renal inflammatory infiltration occurs in various vasculopathies affecting the kidney, in toxic insults to the kidney as well as in pyelonephritis.\n(Choice C) Acute renal tubular dysfunction is typically the result of toxic or ischemic insults to the kidney.\n(Choice E) Patients with obstructive uropathy may also have an increased BUN/Cr ratio, but they typically have a normal volume status and would therefore not exhibit hemoconcentration. Postrenal ARF requires obstruction of both ureters or an obstruction at or distal to the bladder.\n(Choice F) Nodular glomerulosclerosis classically occurs in the setting of diabetic nephropathy. It is a chronic condition of insidious onset characterized by progressive proteinuria and renal insufficiency.\n(Choice G) Hypertensive arteriolosclerosis occurs in the setting of severe hypertension and is often accompanied by headaches and papilledema. RBCs, RBC casts, and protein are usually seen in the urine.\nEducational objective:\nElderly patients with poor oral intake living in nursing homes and taking medications such as NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors and diuretics should be suspected of having prerenal azotemia due to intravascular volume depletion and poor renal perfusion."

    "question": "A 30-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute renal failure secondary to post-\nstreptococcal glomerulonephritis. On his fifth hospital day, he develops retrosternal, non-radiating chest pain\nwhich is relieved by leaning forward. He denies the use of tobacco or drugs. He drinks alcohol\noccasionally. He has no past histary of any serious illness. His temperature is 37.6C (99.8F), blood\npressure is 145/395 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 20/min. A pericardial friction rub is heard on\nchest auscultation. The rest of the examination shows no abnormalities. EKG shows ST segment elevation\nin all leads, with elevation of the PR segment in lead aVR. The chest x-ray is normal. Urinalysis shows\nhematuria, red cell casts and mild proteinuria. Laboratory studies show a BUN level of 60 mg/dL and a\nserum creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Broad spectrum antibiotics",
      "B. Intravenous steroids",
      "C. Hemodialysis",
      "D. Thrombolytic therapy",
      "E. NSAIDs"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has developed acute pericarditis. The character of his chest pain (i.e., non-radiating, retrosternal, relieved by leaning forward) is classic. The typical EKG findings are also given (i.e., diffuse ST elevation that is typically concave up, and elevation of the PR segment in lead aVR). PR segment depression in the other limb leads is also characteristic. Pericardial friction rub may be found on examination.\nThe most common cause of acute pericarditis is a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections, connective tissue diseases (e.g. SLE) and uremia. In this case, the patient's oliguria, hypertension, urinalysis findings (e.g., red cell casts, proteinuria) and azotemia suggest the diagnosis of nephritic syndrome, which led to the development of uremic pericarditis.\nThe development of pericarditis in a patient with renal failure is an indication for dialysis. Hemodialysis is the procedure of choice in such cases.\nThe indications for hemodialysis are:\n1. Refractory hyperkalemia\n2. Volume overload or pulmonary edema not responding to diuretics\n3. Refractory metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2)\n4. Uremic pericarditis\n5. Uremic encephalopathy or neuropathy\n6. Coagulopathy due to renal failure\n(Choice A) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immunologically mediated disease. The use of antibiotics is not going to alter this patient's prognosis. In fact, antibiotics are not indicated unless a significant documented infection is present.\n(Choice B) Steroid therapy is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient.\n(Choice D) Thrombolytic therapy is indicated in patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however, diffuse ST segment elevation in all the leads (rather than inferior, anterior or posterior leads) and pleuritic chest pain suggest that pericarditis is the most likely cause of his chest pain.\n(Choice E) NSAIDs are helpful in most cases of pericarditis. In this case, however, giving NSAIDs may worsen the patient's renal failure, and is therefore not the appropriate choice.\nEducational Objective:\nIndications for hemodialysis\n1. Refractory hyperkalemia\n2. Volume overload or pulmonary edema not responding to diuretics\n3. Refractory metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2)\n4. Uremic pericarditis\n5.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Patients with acute pyelonephritis usually present with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and flank or suprapubic pain. Physical examination shows costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows bacteriuria and pyuria. Therapy should be started with empiric antibiotics before the culture and sensitivity results are available. Severe disease with systemic manifestations warrants intravenous (IV) antibiotics. This patient is vomiting and hypotensive; therefore, IV antibiotics should be administered.\n(Choice A) Oral agents are appropriate only when there are no systemic signs of toxicity and the disease is mild.\n(Choice C) Renal ultrasound is ordered if the patient fails to respond to antibiotic treatment.\n(Choice D) Imaging studies are performed to identify any underlying structural abnormality predisposing to urinary tract infections. These are only indicated if the patient is under 10 years of age, male, or a prepubertal non-sexually active female. Voiding cystoureterogram is usually the imaging study of choice but it is performed only after the acute illness is over. The most commonly identified structural abnormality in the pediatric range is vesico-ureteral reflux.\n(Choice E) Abdominal x-ray is usually used to identify stones; however it is not the appropriate choice here. Even for stones, CT scan of the abdomen is the best diagnostic study.\nEducational Objective:\nPatients with acute pyelonephritis usually present with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and flank or suprapubic pain. Physical examination shows costovertebral angle tenderness. Hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics are indicated in complicated acute pyelonephritis."

    "explanation": "The most probable diagnosis in this patient is urine discoloration due to rifampin. It is important to remember that rifampin causes red to orange discoloration of body fluids including urine, saliva, sweat, and tears. It can also cause discoloration of soft contact lenses. Knowing this fact will help you to get an 'easy’ diagnosis. Of course, more serious conditions should be ruled out, starting with simple urinalysis. Absence of significant changes on urinalysis (proteinuria, hematuria, and sterile pyuria) essentially rules out renal tuberculosis or tuberculosis-associated glomerulopathy (Choice E).\n(Choices A and D) Hematuria during acute cystitis or nephrolithiasis is usually accompanied by pain and dysuric symptoms.\nEducational Objective:\nRifampin causes red to orange discoloration of body fluids. 'Red urine’ in a patient taking rifampin is usually a benign drug effect."

Other agents responsible for this condition are: antibiotics (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, rifampicin, trimethoprim), NSAIDs, diuretics and captopril.\n(Choice A) The patient is unlikely to have disseminated gonococcemia because of the following:\n1) The skin lesions in this condition include papules, but also pustules with a hemorrhagic component\n2) Gonococcemia is unlikely to produce nephritis with eosinophil casts\n3) The patient is not promiscuous.\n(Choice B) Postinfectious glomerulonephritis produces hematuria, mild proteinuria, RBC casts and fluid retention resulting in hypertension and periorbital edema. It occurs 1-2 weeks after an episode of streptococcal pharyngitis/skin infection and not after a urinary infection as in this case.\n(Choice D) Although the patient has a family history of SLE, lupus nephritis is unlikely. The mucocutaneous manifestations of lupus include, malar rash and discoid rash. The patient in the present case has a maculopapular rash. SLE causes glomerulonephritis which is characterized by hypertension, mild proteinuria and RBC casts.\n(Choice E) Pyelonephritis can complicate an untreated cystitis, but it manifests with chills, fever as high as 40.0C(104.0F) and tenderness in the flanks and/or the costovertebral angle.\nEducational Objective:\nDrug induced interstitial nephritis is usually caused by cephalosporins, penicillins, sulfonamides, NSAIDs, rifampin, phenytoin and allopurinol.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cyclosporine is a commonly used immunosuppressant. It acts by inhibiting the transcription of interleukin-2 and several other cytokines, mainly the T-helper lymphocytes.\nSome of the most common side effects of cyclosporine are:\n1. Nephrotoxicity. This is the most common and serious side effect. It may manifest as reversible acute azotemia or irreversible progressive renal disease. Hyperuricemia with accelerated gout, hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia can be seen as manifestations of renal-induced dysfunction. Rarely, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may be seen.\n2. Hypertension: This is due to renal vasoconstriction and sodium retention. It is generally seen in the first few weeks of therapy. Calcium channel blockers are the drugs of choice for treatment.\n3. Neurotoxicity: This is often reversible. It manifests as headache, visual disturbances, seizure, mild tremors, akinetic mutism, etc.\n4. Glucose intolerance: This is fairly common. Patients who are concurrently taking prednisone (steroids) might develop significant hyperglycemia.\n5. Infection: Chronic therapy with cyclosporine is associated with infection in 40% of patients.\n6. Malignancy. There is an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and lymphoproliferative diseases.\n7. Gingival hypertrophy and hirsutism.\n8. GI manifestations, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea: These are fairly common but mild.\n(Choice A) Tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic produced by fungi. It has the same mechanism of action as cyclosporine and has a similar toxicity profile (including nephrotoxicity and hyperkalemia); however, in contrast to cyclosporine, tacrolimus does not cause hirsutism or gum hypertrophy, and has a higher incidence of neurotoxicity, diarrhea, and glucose intolerance.\n(Choice C) Azathioprine is a purine analog that is enzymatically converted to 6-mercaptopurine. It acts primarily by inhibiting purine synthesis. The major toxicity of azathioprine is dose-related diarrhea, leukopenia, and hepatotoxicity.\n(Choice D) Mycophenolate is a reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo purine synthesis. The major toxicity of mycophenolate is bone marrow suppression.\nEducational Objective:\nCyclosporine and tacrolimus have the same mechanism of action (calcineurin-inhibitors). The major side effects of cyclosporine include nephrotoxicity, hyperkalemia, hypertension, gum hypertrophy, hirsutism, and tremor. Tacrolimus has similar toxicities, except for hirsutism and gum hypertrophy.\n*The major toxicity of azathioprine is dose-related diarrhea, leukopenia, and hepatotoxicity.\n*The major toxicity of mycophenolate is bone marrow suppression.\n*Extremely high yield question for the USMLE!!!\n"

      "D. Stop HCTZ and recheck lab results in 1 week",
      "rE tart natient an 2 loss matacenirm diet"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The most remarkable finding in this patient is hyperkalemia (K+ = 5.7 mmol/L). Hyperkalemia can be caused by decreased renal K+ excretion, transcellular shift, increased K+ intake, medications (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs) and pseudohyperkalemia. Pseudohyperkalemia should always be considered in asymptomatic patients, as occasionally the lab sample can become hemolysed during venipuncture; however, it was clarified in this case that the patient's blood sample was not hemolysed. Furthermore, his current use of a potassium sparing diuretic (amiloride) is a plausible cause for his hyperkalemia.\nThe most serious effect of hyperkalemia is cardiac toxicity, therefore, all patients with hyperkalemia should have an EKG performed. The earliest EKG changes include increased T-wave amplitude (peaked T waves), followed by prolonged PR interval and QRS duration, and eventual loss of P waves. Progressive widening of the QRS complex and merging with the T wave produces a sine-wave pattern. This can progress towards the terminal event, which is usually ventricular fibrillation or asystole.\nThe approach to treatment depends on the EKG changes and degree of hyperkalemia. Immediate treatment is indicated if there is cardiac toxicity (as evidenced by EKG changes), muscular paralysis, or K+ >=6.5. For these patients, 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate should be administered to stabilize the myocardial membrane. To lower the K+ level, insulin and/or B2-agonists may be used since either of these drugs can shift K+ into cells. Sodium bicarbonate can also be used to shift K+ into cells. Slower acting treatments to increase K+ excretion include loop and thiazide diuretics if renal function is adequate, and cation exchange resins. Dialysis should be reserved for patients with renal failure and those with severe life-threatening hyperkalemia that is unresponsive to the more conservative measures. In this case, the patient is asymptomatic and with normal EKG findings (i.e. without indications for immediate drug therapy); therefore, he may be treated less aggressively by simply stopping usage of the causative drug (i.e., amiloride) and rechecking his blood levels after one week.\n(Choices A and B) If this patient had any evidence of cardiac toxicity or a potassium level = 6.5, then it would be appropriate to administer calcium gluconate and IV dextrose + insulin.\n(Choice D) HCTZ helps increase the renal excretion of K+; therefore, stopping this drug may further increase the K+ level.\n(Choice E) Starting the patient on a low potassium diet is not the best next step in this patient's management. A plausible underlying cause has been identified (i.e., amiloride use); therefore, it is most appropriate to first stop usage of this drug and recheck the potassium level after one week.\nEducational Objective:\nSeveral medications can cause hyperkalemia. Examples of these are: ACE-inhibitors, NSAIDs, and potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone and amiloride.\n*Extremely important question for the USMLE step-2"

Dysuria and urinary frequency can occur. Urinalysis reveals absent bacteriuria. Urine culture shows less than 100 colonies/mL.\n(Choice A) Patients with acute pyelonephritis appear toxic and present with fever, nausea, vomiting, flank pain, dysuria, and costovertebral tenderness. Urinalysis shows bacteriuria and pyuria. Urine culture reveals greater than 10,000 colonies/mL.\n(Choice B) Patients with acute bacterial cystitis present with dysuria, urinary frequency, suprapubic discomfort and urinary findings of bacteriuria and pyuria. Mucopurulent cervical discharge is not found. Urine culture shows colonies in excess of 1000/mL.\n(Choice D) Gonococcal urethritis is less common than chlamydial urethritis. The urethral discharge is purulent (rather than mucopurulent), and Gram stain usually reveals the causative organisms.\n(Choice E) The usual features of vaginitis are vaginal discharge, pruritus and dyspareunia. Increased urinary frequency is unusual.\nEducational Objective:\nChlamydial urethritis is suggested by mucopurulent urethral discharge, absent bacteriuria, and history of multiple sexual partners."

    "question": "A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening fatigue and nausea. He had a carotid angiogram for the evaluation of symptomatic carotid artery stenosis 15 days ago, and was discharged home three days after the procedure. His medical problems are hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, intermittent claudication, hypertension for 18 years, and diabetes mellitus for 15 years. Physical examination shows painless, reddish-blue mottling of the skin of the extremities.

    "options": [
      "A. Contrast nephropathy",
      "B. Cholesterol embolism",
      "C. Diabetic nephropathy",
      "D. Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis",
      "E. Acute allergic interstitial nephropathy"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Atheroembolic disease (AED), also known as cholesterol embolization, occurs due to showering of cholesterol crystals from the aorta or other major arteries. It usually manifests following surgical or interventional manipulation of the arterial tree, or during/following treatment with anticoagulants or thrombolytics. Renal failure, skin manifestations (livedo reticularis, blue toe syndrome), cerebral or intestinal ischemia, and Hollenhorst plaques are common manifestations. Lab findings may include eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and hypocomplementemia. The definitive diagnosis is made by tissue biopsy, which shows cholesterol crystals. Treatment is conservative. Anticoagulation should be stopped since it may prevent healing of the ruptured plagues. Steroids have been used with little success.\n(Choice A) Contrast-induced nephropathy (contrast is used for the angiogram) is usually seen within 24-72 hours of the procedure. It is very unlikely to occur five days after the procedure. Patients usually improve over a period of time, and do not present with skin findings. The recommendations for the prevention of contrast nephropathy are: (1) periprocedural hydration, (2) use of a low-osmolality contrast, and (3) limiting the amount of contrast agent. Patients with borderline renal failure will also benefit from prophylactic administration of N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) and fenoldopam.\n(Choice C) Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by heavy proteinuria, and is not associated with eosinophiluria and eosinophilia (which were seen in this patient). Furthermore, DM nephropathy develops over a period of years, not months. Hence, If a diabetic patient presents with a rapid decline (over months) in renal function, look for other causes of renal failure.\n(Choice D) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is characterized by a nephritic picture in a patient with a history of streptococcal throat or skin infections. Complement levels are low. Skin manifestations such as livedo reticularis or eosinophilia are not seen.\n(Choice E) Acute allergic interstitial nephropathy is a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction characterized by rash, renal failure, eosinophilia, and eosinophiluria (Hansel stain). The common medications that you should remember for the exam are:\n1. Antibiotics (most common is methicillin group)\n2. NSAIDs (often cause heavy proteinuria)\n3. Thiazides\n4. Phenytoin\n5. Allopurinol"

    "question": "A 50-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to a sudden onset of severe, colicky pain in the right flank. He was admitted twice in the past for similar complaints; he was managed conservatively and sent home on both occasions. He has no other medical problems. He does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. His vital signs are stable. He is given IV fluids and narcotics. Laboratory studies show:\nHb 14.5 g/dL\nWBC 13,000/cmm; no bands\nPlatelets 300,000/cmm\nBUN 16 mg/dL\nSerum Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nCT scan of the abdomen without contrast shows renal calculi. Which of the following is the best advice for the prevention of future stones in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Decrease dietary calcium intake",
      "B. Mega doses of Vitamin C",
      "C. Decrease dietary protein and oxalate",
      "D. Restrict fluid intake",
      "E. Increase sodium intake"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Renal calculi typically present as colicky abdominal pain. The most common renal stones are calcium stones. CT scan of the abdomen without contrast is the diagnostic procedure of choice because it can detect radioopaque (e.g., calcium) as well as radiolucent (e.g., uric acid) stones. (KUB or abdominal radiograph is not the best test!) A high protein diet is associated with an increased predisposition to stone formation, mainly calcium stones; hence, patients with an established diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should be advised to restrict protein in their diet.\n(Choice A) Although hypercalciuria is commonly present in patients with stone disease, dietary calcium restriction is no longer recommended in patients with renal calculi. Limiting calcium intake actually has a paradoxical effect, and has been associated with an enhanced tendency towards stone formation. For these reasons, patients are now encouraged to include calcium in their diet.\n(Choice B) Mega doses of Vitamin C lead to increased formation of oxalate stones, especially in patients with renal failure.\n(Choice D) Restricted fluid intake actually precipitates stone formation. The resultant decreased urine output increases urinary oxalate and calcium concentration. Adequate hydration is thus recommended, and patients are typically advised to drink at least 2 liters of fluid per day.\n(Choice E) Increased sodium intake enhances calcium excretion. Furthermore, sodium and water reabsorption is followed by passive reabsorption of calcium in the proximal tubule. Since hypercalciuria is a common finding in patients with renal calculi, such patients should be advised to restrict sodium intake. Patients with hypercalciuria and recurrent stones should be placed on hydrochlorothiazide to prevent recurrent stone formation. If a patient on adequate HCTZ develops recurrent calcium stones, his urine sodium level should be checked to make sure that he is compliant with the sodium-restricted diet."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the emergency department (ED) with severe right flank pain. He is tossing in bed due to the pain. KUB done in the ED shows no abnormalities; however, abdominal ultrasound shows a 5 mm stone in the right ureter. Urinalysis shows:\nUrine pH 4.5 (normal is 5-8)\nWBC Absent\nRBC 2-3/HPF\nBacteria Absent\nNitrites Negative\nEsterase Negative\nWhich of the following is the most beneficial next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Oral sodium bicarbonate",
      "B. Hydrochlorothiazide",
      "C. Furosemide",
      "D. High-protein diet",
      "E. Calcium-restricted diet"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Consider three possibilities when a flat film of the abdomen and pelvis does not show a stone in a patient with typical renal colic:\n1. radiolucent stone disease (uric acid stones)\n2. calcium stones less than 1 to 3 mm in diameter\n3. non-stone causes (e.g., obstruction by a blood clot or tumor)\nIn this case, the patient most likely has uric acid stones. Uric acid stones account for approximately 10-15% of cases of total nephrolithiasis. These are most commonly seen in patients with unusually low urine pH levels (which may be due to a defect in renal ammonia secretion) and hyperuricosuria. These are radiolucent, but can be seen on USG and CT scan (as in this patient). Treatment includes hydration, alkalinization of urine, and a low-purine diet with/without allopurinol, depending on the presence of hyperuricosuria. Since uric acid stones are highly soluble in alkaline urine, alkalinization of urine to pH >= 6.5 with oral sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate is indicated.\n(Choice B) Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion, and is used in the management of recurrent hypercalciuric renal stones.\n(Choice C) Furosemide is associated with hypercalciuria, and can thus predispose a patient to calcium stone formation.\n(Choice D) A purine-restricted diet (not high-protein diet) is indicated in patients with uric acid stones secondary to hyperuricosuria.\n(Choice E) A calcium-restricted diet is not beneficial in the management of uric acid stones. It is not advised even in patients with calcium stones, as calcium restriction can cause potential negative calcium balance and hyperoxaluria due to the consequent increased GI absorption of oxalate."

    "question": "A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of 2 episodes of hematuria. He also complains of cough, fatigue and fever for several days. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 25 years. He does not use alcohol or drugs. Vital signs are stable. Examination shows a left-sided varicocele which fails to empty when the patient is recumbent; examination otherwise shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show Hb of 16.2 g/dL and platelets of 480,000/cmm. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chest x-ray",
      "B. Abdominal CT scan",
      "C. Urinalysis",
      "D. Serum alfa-fetoprotein levels",
      "E. Ultrasonogram of the testicles"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Most of the patients with RCC are asymptomatic until the disease is advanced. The classic triad of RCC (flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable abdominal renal mass) is uncommon (10% of patients); when present, it strongly suggests advanced/metastatic disease. Hematuria is seen only in about 40% of patients. Scrotal varicocele, (the majority are on left-side), may be observed in a few patients (<=10%). Varicoceles typically fail to empty when the patient is recumbent. Presence of this finding should always raise suspicion for a renal cell carcinoma, which is most commonly due to obstruction of the gonadal vein where it enters the renal vein. 20% of patients may also have constitutional symptoms like fever, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, or an easy fatigability. Increased erythropoietin by kidney mass can produce polycythemia and thrombocytosis.\n(Choice B) CT scan of the abdomen is most sensitive and specific for diagnosing the renal cell carcinoma and should be obtained when the index of suspicion is high.\n(Choice A) Chest x-ray is an important investigation to look for metastasis but is not going to reveal the diagnosis in this patient.\n(Choice C) Urinalysis may detect hematuria but it is nonspecific and only 40% of patients with renal cell carcinoma have hematuria.\n(Choices D and E) These findings are unlikely with testicular carcinoma; therefore, an USG of the testicles or serum alpha fetoprotein are not required in this patient."

    "question": "A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency presents with gross hematuria. His baseline serum creatinine is 1.6-1.7 mg/dL. The patient's medications include aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril, and simvastatin. He has no known environmental, medication, or contrast allergies. On physical examination, the patient has a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The examination is otherwise unremarkable. Contrast CT scan of the abdomen is planned to evaluate his condition. Which of the following interventions would be most helpful in preventing contrast-induced kidney damage?",
    "options": [
      "A. Prednisone",
      "B. Non-ionic contrast agent",
      "C. Furosemide",
      "D. 100% oxygen mask",
      "E. Stopping simvastatin"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Before ordering a CT scan with contrast, the physician should always consider the patient's renal function. Patients with a history of renal insufficiency (Cr>=1.5) and/or diabetes are at heightened risk for contrast-induced nephropathy. In these cases, alternative studies (e.g. ultrasound) should be considered. If CT with contrast is necessary, certain precautions can be taken to minimize the risk of contrast nephropathy. Non-ionic contrast agents have been shown to decrease the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy compared to the older ionic hyperosmolar agents. The patient described above is at especially high risk as he has both diabetes and an elevated baseline creatinine, thus, non-ionic contrast agents should be used.\n(Choice A) Prednisone can be used to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media in patients with known dye allergies. Dye allergies cause reactions like flushing, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, etc. when contrast is administered. Prednisone does not prevent contrast-induced nephropathy, and in patients with renal insufficiency, prednisone can actually cause fluid retention. Prednisone can also cause elevations in blood pressure.\n(Choice C) Diuretics do not prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Furosemide may actually slightly increase the risk of contrast nephropathy.\n(Choice D) Administration of 100% oxygen does not prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Furthermore, administration of high concentrations of supplemental oxygen when it is not indicated can lead to negative consequences.\n(Choice E) Though not currently recommended for routine administration prior to contrast administration, statins are known to improve endothelial function and reduce oxidative stress and may therefore have some benefit in preventing contrast nephropathy. NSAIDs, on the other hand, should be withheld before the procedure, as they can cause renal vasoconstriction."

    "question": "A patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia has moderately severe symptoms and is started on finasteride. After six months of treatment with finasteride, his symptoms improve remarkably and his prostate has regressed in size. Which of the following histological patterns was most likely present at the time of initiation of treatment?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hyperplasia of prostate with predominance of epithelial components",
      "B. Hyperplasia of prostate with predominance of muscular element",
      "C. Hyperplasia of prostate with predominance of collagen",
      "D. Hyperplasia of prostate with predominance of both collagen and smooth muscles"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia is either with finasteride or alpha-1 blockers. Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and it inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It acts on the epithelial components of the prostate gland and produces improvement of symptoms as well as reduction in the size of the gland. There are various histological patterns of BPH. Some patients have predominant epithelial hyperplasia and others have predominant stromal hyperplasia. Those with stromal hyperplasia may have collagen or smooth muscle predominance. Patients with epithelial predominance best respond to treatment with finasteride (Choice A).\nAlpha-1 blockers produce symptomatic improvement in patients with BPH by their action on smooth muscles present in prostate and bladder base. Patients with smooth muscle predominance best respond to treatment with alpha-1 blockers. Patients with collagen predominance respond neither to finasteride nor to alpha-1 blockers."

      "D. Renal cell cancer",
      "E. Bladder cancer"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is rhabdomyolysis, which is characterized by the breakdown of muscles. Its most common cause is alcoholism. Its risk factors include crush injuries to the muscles, strenuous exercise, seizures and metabolic derangements. Dipstick testing reveals hematuria, but microscopic analysis of urine does not reveal RBCs. Serum creatinine levels are disproportionately elevated as compared with BUN levels. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) can occur in the setting of rhabdomyolysis due to ischemia or toxins, which may be endogenous or exogenous. Hemoglobin or myoglobin are endogenous nephrotoxic substances which can accumulate in the kidney due to the breakdown of muscles, thereby leading to ATN. Serum CK levels should be measured in suspected patients. The treatment includes aggressive intravenous hydration and alkalinization of urine. In some cases, forced diuresis with mannitol may be required.\n(Choice A) Post-infectious glomerulonephritis presents with a picture of nephritic syndrome. Urinalysis shows active urinary sediment with red blood cell clumps and red blood cell casts. Hypertension and oliguria may be observed.\n(Choice B) Hepatorenal syndrome occurs in patients with advanced liver failure and azotemia.\n(Choice D) Renal cell cancer presents with the triad of dull flank pain, hematuria and fever. Both dipstick testing and microscopic examination reveal hematuria. This is a good differential diagnosis for this patient; however, the characteristic findings and history of a prior flu-like illness make the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis more likely.\n(Choice E) Bladder cancer presents with painless hematuria. Both dipstick testing and microscopic examination reveal hematuria."

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient with nephrotic-range proteinuria and hematuria most likely has membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Dense intramembranous deposits that stain for C3 is a characteristic microscopic finding for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, type 2 (also called dense deposit disease). This condition is unique among glomerulopathies, because it is caused by IgG antibodies (termed C3 nephritic factor) directed against C3 convertase of the alternative complement pathway. These antibodies reacting with C3 convertase lead to persistent complement activation and kidney damage.\n(Choice A) Anti-GBM antibodies are characteristic for Goodpasture's syndrome.\n(Choice B) Circulating immune complexes account for the group of glomerulonephritis called immune complex-mediated glomerulopathies that include SLE, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, etc.\n(Choice D) Cell-mediated injury may be important in idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis.\n(Choice E) Non-immunologic kidney damage is believed to operate in diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, etc."

      "C. Hypercoagulability",
      "D. Pulmonary hemorrhage",
      "E. Gall stone pancreatitis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient in this clinical vignette has nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is a clinical complex characterized by:\n1. Proteinuria (>= 3-3.5 g/day - most important manifestation)\n2. Hypoalbuminemia\n3. Edema\n4. Hyperlipidemia and lipiduria\nThe basic pathology is altered permeability of the glomerular membrane for proteins. Diseases most commonly causing nephrotic syndrome are minimal change disease (in children), membranous glomerulopathy (adults), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\nNephrotic syndrome is frequently complicated by hypercoagulation, with a consequent risk of thromboembolic complications. The etiology of hypercoagulation in nephrotic syndrome is multifactorial and includes: increased urinary loss of antithrombin 3, altered levels of protein C and S, increased platelet aggregation, hyperfibrinogenemia due to increased hepatic synthesis, and impaired fibrinolysis. Renal vein thrombosis is the most common manifestation of coagulopathy (especially with membranous glomerulopathy), but arterial thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may also occur. Coagulopathy is less common but more severe in children as compared to adults with nephrotic syndrome.\nComplications of nephrotic syndrome include: protein malnutrition, iron-resistant microcytic hypochromic anemia due to transferrin loss, vitamin D deficiency due to increased urinary excretion of cholecalciferol-binding protein, decreased thyroxin levels due to loss of thyroxine-binding globulin, and increased susceptibility to infection.\n(Choices A and B) Rupture of a brain aneurysm and abdominal aortic aneurysms are more likely to be seen in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease. Such patients do not present with nephrotic syndrome.\n(Choice D) Pulmonary hemorrhage is a manifestation of Goodpasture's disease or Wegener's granulomatosis. These cause nephritic (not nephrotic) syndrome.\n(Choice E) Gallstone pancreatitis is not a complication of nephrotic syndrome."

She takes hydrochlorothiazide and naproxen. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Her blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows generalized edema; liver is palpated 2 cm below the costal margin. Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria. Ultrasound of the kidneys shows slight enlargement. Renal biopsy was performed. Which of the following is the most likely finding on renal specimen analysis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Crescent formation on light microscopy",
      "B. Deposits revealed under polarized light",

      "D. Granular immunoglobulin deposits revealed on immunofluorescence microscopy",
      "E. Normal light microscopy findings"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Amyloidosis is the most probable cause of nephrotic syndrome in this patient. The clues to the correct diagnosis include history of rheumatoid arthritis (that predisposes to amyloidosis), enlarged kidneys, and hepatomegaly. The typical findings on renal biopsy in such a patient are amyloid deposits that show apple-green birefringence under polarized light after staining with Congo red. Extracellular amyloid fibrils demonstrated on electron microscopy are also typical.\n(Choice A) Crescent formation revealed on light microscopy is characteristic for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n(Choices C and D) Linear immunoglobulin deposits on immunofluorescence microscopy are typical for anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (e.g., Goodpasture's syndrome) and granular deposits are usually present during immune complex glomerulonephritis (e.g., lupus nephritis or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis).\n(Choice E) Normal light microscopy findings in a patient with nephrotic syndrome usually suggest minimal change disease."

The review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and a transient ischemic attack. He takes a baby aspirin and hydrochlorothiazide daily. His temperature is 36.7C (98F), blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min and respirations are 16/min. A complete physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Polycystic kidney disease",
      "B. Renal cell carcinoma",
      "C. Bladder mass",
      "D. Acute glomerulonephritis",
      "E. Schistosoma infection"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described is experiencing gross painless hematuria. In adults, gross hematuria should be considered to be due to a kidney, ureter or bladder malignancy until proven otherwise as it is the initial presenting sign in up to 80% of such tumors. The appropriate initial investigations in a patient with painless gross hematuria are assessment of the upper urinary tract with a contrast CT scan or intravenous pyelogram as well as endoscopic assessment of the bladder and urethra. The most common causes of hematuria in the United States are neoplasms, infections, trauma, nephrolithiasis, glomerulonephritis and prostatic disease. The presence of erythrocytes in the urine should always be confirmed microscopically because grossly red urine may also occur in myoglobinuria, hemoglobinuria or porphyria, following the consumption of a large amount of beets or as an adverse effect of certain medications such as rifampin.\n(Choice A) Adult polycystic kidney disease is an autosomal dominant progressive kidney disease that causes end stage renal disease in the majority of patients by 60 years of age. It is associated with recurrent flank pain, renal infections and nephrolithiasis as well as an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma.\n(Choice B) Painless hematuria is often a presenting symptom in renal cell carcinoma, but this is a less common cause than a bladder mass.\n(Choice D) Acute glomerulonephritis is typically accompanied by edema (classically periorbital), hypertension, renal insufficiency and proteinuria.\n(Choice E) Infection by Schistosoma haematobium causes symptoms such as dysuria and urinary frequency followed by gross hematuria and bladder pain later in the disease. While a common cause of hematuria in the Middle East and Africa, this illness is uncommon in the United States due to the absence of the appropriate snail intermediate host."

    "question": "A 73-year-old man comes to the physician because of a one-year history of progressively worsening urinary urgency, hesitancy, nocturia, and weak urinary stream. He has no fever, abdominal pain, hematuria, malaise or weight loss. He takes atenolol for essential hypertension. He has no history of diabetes mellitus or ischemic heart disease. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Rectal examination shows a smooth, firm enlargement of the prostate with no induration or asymmetry. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show serum creatinine of 2.1 mg/dl. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ultrasound of kidneys, ureters, and bladder",
      "B. Watchful waiting",
      "C. Transurethral resection of prostate",
      "D. Treatment with finasteride",
      "E. Treatment with prazosin"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The above patient is most likely suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia. All patients with irritative or obstructive voiding symptoms should have their urinalysis and serum creatinine done; as such symptoms are not always due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Such symptoms may be produced by multiple causes like benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, urethral stricture, neurogenic bladder and urinary tract infections. Urinalysis helps to rule out urinary tract infection and serum creatinine detects renal insufficiency that might be due to bladder outlet obstruction. Patients with elevated serum creatinine levels should have ultrasound of the kidney, ureter and bladder done. Therefore in the above patient, the most appropriate next step is ultrasound (Choice A).\n(Choice B) Management of benign prostatic hyperplasia depends upon the severity of symptoms and the presence or absence of complications or other concomitant conditions. Patients with mild symptoms are treated with watchful waiting.\n(Choices D and E) Patients with moderate symptoms are given medical treatment with finasteride or alpha-adrenergic blockers like terazosin.\n(Choice C) Patients with severe symptoms are candidates for surgical treatment for which TransUrethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) is the standard of care. Patients with recurrent urinary tract infection, recurrent gross hematuria, bladder stones, renal insufficiency or refractory urinary retention are also candidates for invasive treatment."

His temperature is 37C (98.6F), blood pressure is 126/70 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Examination shows no abnormalities. He is given adequate analgesia. Non-contrast helical CT shows a 4 mm radiopaque stone in the right upper ureter. Laboratory studies show serum calcium of 9.8 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and BUN of 15 mg/dL. Urinalysis shows hematuria but no casts. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. 24 hr urine collection for metabolic evaluation",
      "B. Reassurance",
      "C. Fluid intake greater than 2 L/day",
      "D. Intake of potassium citrate",
      "E. Restriction of dietary oxalate"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has the classic clinical presentation of nephrolithiasis. The following are important concepts in the management of such patients.\n1. Imaging study - CT scan of the abdomen without contrast is the investigation of choice because of its high sensitivity and specificity. It has the advantage over the plain abdominal x-ray (KUB) in detecting the radiolucent stones.\n2. Narcotics and NSAIDs - These are equally effective in relieving the pain of acute renal colic; however, in patients with normal renal function, NSAIDs are preferred over narcotics because the latter can exacerbate nausea and vomiting.\n3. Size of the stone - Stones measuring less than 5mm in diameter typically pass spontaneously with conservative management. This includes a fluid intake of greater than 2L daily. Increased hydration increases the urinary flow rate and lowers the urinary solute concentration, thus preventing stone formation.\n4. Urology referral - Urgent urologic evaluation is warranted in patients with anuria, urosepsis, or acute renal failure.\n(Choice A) A detailed metabolic evaluation is not needed when a patient presents with his first renal stone. In patients with recurrent renal stones, 24-hr urine is collected to identify any underlying metabolic disorder. A complete urinary evaluation includes measurement of calcium, citrate, creatinine, uric acid, oxalate, pH and sodium levels.\n(Choice B) Reassurance alone is not appropriate. Although his renal stone is relatively small, he still requires conservative management (i.e., adequate hydration).\n(Choice D) Potassium citrate is the appropriate treatment when a patient presents with a history of recurrent stone formation due to citrate deficiency.\n(Choice E) Restriction of dietary oxalate is helpful when a patient presents with a history of recurrent calcium stone formation due to hyperoxaluria."

      "E. IgA nephropathy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is seen 10-20 days after streptococcal throat or skin infections. Presenting features may include periorbital swelling, hematuria and oliguria. The patient may be hypertensive and urinalysis shows hematuria with RBC casts and proteinuria. Serum C3 complement levels are low.\n(Choice A) Drug-induced interstitial nephritis occurs with many drugs like penicillins, cephalosporins and sulfonamides. Clinical features include fever, rash and arthralgia. Other features are peripheral eosinophilia, hematuria, sterile pyuria and eosinophiluria. WBC casts may be present in the urine, but red cell casts are rare.\n(Choice B) Patients with acute pyelonephritis may present with high fevers, rigors and flank pain. In addition, their urinalysis shows pyuria and bacteriuria.\n(Choice E) Patients with IgA nephropathy typically present with hematuria after an upper respiratory tract infection and a latent period between infection and the actual onset of the disease. Development of features of glomerular disease is less than 5 days. Serum complement levels are normal in such cases.\n(Choice D) Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is not the likely diagnosis in this case."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Pulmonary-renal syndromes are caused by a variety of disorders, and are characterized by simultaneous involvement of the lungs and kidneys. Quick and thoughtful differential diagnosis should be performed because the management differs per disease.\nGoodpasture's syndrome is caused by circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. Early removal of these antibodies by emergency plasmapheresis is imperative in order to minimize the extent of kidney damage. Emergency plasmapheresis improves the prognosis of patients.\n(Choices B and E) The beneficial effect of plasmapheresis is less clear with other causes of pulmonary-renal syndromes, although it is sometimes a useful adjunct in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, severe polyarteritis nodosa, or idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.\n(Choice C) Plasmapheresis is not effective in patients with SLE-associated nephritis."

      "C. Continue oral ciprofloxacin for another 10 days",
      "D. Perform renal ultrasound"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Acute febrile illness, costovertebral tenderness, pyuria and bacteriuria all suggest the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Initial treatment includes empiric antibiotics. When there is no adequate response to 72-hr treatment with the appropriate antibiotics, urological imaging (e.g., CT scan or ultrasound) is performed to search for any underlying pathologies (e.g., obstruction) or complications (e.g., renal, perirenal abscess).\n(Choices A, B and C) Oral or parenteral antibiotics can be used to treat acute pyelonephritis, depending upon the disease severity. Patients who can take the drugs orally, who are compliant or who are not suffering from severe disease can be started on oral ciprofloxacin as empiric therapy. When the disease is severe or the patient cannot take the antibiotics orally, IV ampicillin plus gentamicin is the appropriate empiric therapy. Failure to respond to oral ciprofloxacin (as in this patient) may indicate the presence of obstruction, abscess, or other complications of acute pyelonephritis. Oral or parenteral antibiotics alone will not help in such cases. Additional interventions and further investigation are necessary."

    "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of urinary frequency and burning during urination. She denies fever, chills, nausea, back pain or abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for a long history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She does not use tobacco or consume alcohol. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg and her heart rate is 70/min. Her hematocrit is 43% and her WBC count is 8,500/mm3.

      "B. Glomerular basement membrane changes",
      "C. Cystic transformation of the renal parenchyma",
      "D. Parenchymal atrophy due to calyceal dilation",
      "E. Insoluble crystal precipitation in the tubular lumen"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's findings on urinalysis are a reflection of two disease processes. Initially she presents with a urinary tract infection characterized by urinary frequency, dysuria, pyuria, and positive nitrates. After the UTI is treated, however, the proteinuria persists. This is most likely a reflection of diabetic nephropathy secondary to her longstanding diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the United States, occurring in 30-40% and 20% of patients with type I and type II diabetes mellitus after 20 years, respectively. The most common histologic lesion in diabetic nephropathy is diffuse glomerulosclerosis. Nodular glomerulosclerosis (with Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules) is pathognomonic. Disease progression can be slowed with strict glycemic control, treatment of hypertension, and angiotensin axis blockade.\n(Choice A) Renal artery stenosis is typically due to atherosclerotic vascular disease. It presents as difficult-to-control hypertension with or without renal dysfunction. Renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension in adults. It does not typically cause proteinuria.\n(Choice C) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the leading cause of inherited renal disease in adults. It typically presents as abdominal or flank pain with microscopic or gross hematuria. There is a positive family history in 75% of cases and over half of patients have hypertension at presentation. Proteinuria is not a classic finding.\n(Choice D) Parenchymal atrophy due to calyceal dilation occurs in obstructive nephropathy. This patient does not have any symptoms of urinary obstruction. Urinary obstruction is much more common in men than in women.\n(Choice E) Insoluble crystal deposition resulting in acute renal failure is seen with hyperuricemia (tumor lysis syndrome), indinavir, acyclovir, and sulfonamide therapy."

She had been admitted with pyelonephritis secondary to a multi-drug resistant organism, and received several days of intravenous antibiotics. Her serum creatinine on admission had been 2.1mg/dL. Today it is found to be 4.9 mg/dL. Urinalysis reveals rare epithelial casts and no white blood cells. FE(Na) is greater than 2%. What antibiotic did she most likely receive during her hospitalization?",

      "A. Nafcillin",
      "B. Vancomycin",
      "C. Levofloxacin",
      "D. Amikacin",
      "E. Doxycycline",
      "F. Azithromycin"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has acute renal failure (ARF) in the setting of chronic kidney disease. Of the drugs listed, amikacin is the most likely causative agent. There are several indications that amikacin or another aminoglycoside is the cause of this patient's acute renal failure. First, she had pyelonephritis with a multidrug-resistant organism, probably a gram-negative rod. Aminoglycosides are commonly used in this setting. Second, her urine sediment does not contain any white blood cells. If she had acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), eosinophils and white blood cell casts would be present in her urine. Third, her elevated FE(Na) is not consistent with a pre-renal etiology of acute renal failure. Aminoglycosides may be used in patients with renal dysfunction, but their serum levels and the patient's renal function must be followed closely. Because of their adverse effects and need for monitoring, aminoglycosides are being used with decreasing frequency, particularly in older patients.\n(Choice A) Nafcillin is a common cause of acute renal failure due to AIN. This drug is used to treat infections caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Nafcillin would not have been used to treat multidrug-resistant pyelonephritis and her urinary sediment is not consistent with AIN.\n(Choice B) Vancomycin is used to treat infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). MRSA pyelonephritis is uncommon but may occur in patients who are chronically ill, are institutionalized, or have indwelling bladder catheters. Vancomycin can be nephrotoxic at high doses and it must be dosed according to serum levels. This woman is more likely to have been infected with a gram-negative organism than a gram-positive one, so is unlikely to have received vancomycin.\n(Choice C) Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic often used to treat pyelonephritis. Levofloxacin must be renally dosed but is not a common cause of ARF.\n(Choice E) Doxycycline is most often used to treat community acquired pneumonia, some zoonotic infections (e.g., Lyme disease), Chlamydia, and acne. It is not strongly associated with renal dysfunction and is not likely to have been used for multidrug-resistant pyelonephritis.\n(Choice F) Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic typically used to treat community acquired pneumonia, sinus infections, streptococcal pharyngitis, and Chlamydia. It has approximately 20% renal clearance but is not strongly associated with acute renal failure."

Its disturbing side effect is priapism, which is a persistent, painful erection that develops without sexual stimulation and has a long duration.\nRemember the common causes of priapism:\n1. Sickle cell disease and leukemia - usually in children or adolescents\n2. Perineal or genital trauma - results in laceration of the cavernous artery\n3. Neurogenic lesions - such as spinal cord injury, cauda equina compression, etc.\n4. Medications - such as trazodone and prazosin\nNone of the other medications listed can cause priapism.\n(Choice A) Fluoxetine can lead to sexual dysfunction, resulting in impotence, decreased libido and ejaculatory problems, but it usually does not cause priapism. SSRIs typically cause delayed orgasm; for this reason, these drugs can be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation.\n(Choice C) Most antihypertensive medications (including enalapril) can cause impotence, but do not cause priapism. Nonselective beta-blockers such as propranolol usually cause impotence.\n(Choice D) Glyburide also does not cause this side effect.\n(Choice E) Some degree of erectile dysfunction is associated with the use of simvastatin, although this is rarely seen.

    "question": "A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of increasing urinary frequency and urgency. He has had these symptoms in the past, but they are more troublesome now. He has also had urinary hesitancy and interruption of flow. His temperature is 37C(98.6F), blood pressure is 130/75mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except increased tone of the anal sphincter and mild periprostatic tenderness. Urinalysis and urine culture shows no abnormalities and expressed prostatic secretions show a leukocyte count of four WBCs/HPF (normal is less than 10 WBCs/HPF). Serum prostate-specific antigen is 2 ng/ml (normal value is less than 4ng/ml). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Patients with non-inflammatory chronic prostatitis are afebrile and have irritative voiding symptoms. Physical examination is unremarkable and urinalysis is normal. Expressed prostatic secretions show a normal number of leukocytes and culture of these secretions is negative for bacteria. There is usually no history of past UTI but voiding abnormalities may be present in the past.\n(Choice A) Patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis are afebrile and have irritative voiding symptoms like urinary frequency, urgency and suprapubic or perineal discomfort. Urinalysis is normal. Expressed prostatic secretions show leukocyte count greater than 10 WBCs/HPF and culture of these secretions grows the colonies of causative pathogen. Rectal examination may show normal or indurated prostate.\n(Choice B) Patients with inflammatory chronic prostatitis are afebrile and have irritative voiding symptoms like urinary frequency, urgency and suprapubic or perineal discomfort. Urinalysis is normal.

    "question": "A 16-year-old girl presents with a 2-day history of lower abdominal discomfort, burning micturition and increased frequency of urination. She had her first sexual intercourse last week. Her vital signs are stable. Examination shows suprapubic tenderness. Urinalysis shows positive nitrites, positive esterase, 50+ WBC, and many bacteria. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism responsible for her clinical condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Sexual transmission",
      "B. Hematogenous spread of infection",
      "C. Lymphatic spread of infection",
      "D. Poor genital hygiene",
      "E. Ascending infection"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical features (i.e, lower abdominal discomfort, burning on micturition, increased frequency of micturition, suprapubic tenderness, significant bacteriuria) are highly suggestive of a urinary tract infection, particularly cystitis.\nThe urinary tract is generally sterile, with the exception of the distal end of the urethra and meatus. Normally, the enteric gram-negative bacilli that commonly cause UTI do not colonize the vaginal introitus and distal urethra; however colonization may occur in the presence of predisposing factors (e.g., alteration of the normal vaginal flora by antibiotics, genital infections, contraceptives such as diaphragms and especially spermicide, poor genital hygiene, etc). It is currently a widely accepted theory that UTIs most commonly occur via the ascending route. In this patient, urethral massage during intercourse most likely facilitated the entry of a small number of periurethral bacteria into the bladder via the ascending route, which consequently resulted in a UTI.\n(Choice A) Sexual intercourse is one of the most important risk factors for developing uncomplicated UTIs in women, due to its mechanical effect of introducing uropathogens into the bladder (honeymoon cystitis). Despite such predisposition, however, the bladder's defense mechanism is generally very competent, and most females suffer only an occasional episode of UTI. Sexual transmission of uropathogens can thus occur, but this does not commonly cause UTIs. Sexual transmission of UTIs from females to male is very rare.\nIn this patient, although sexual transmission is a possible explanation, an ascending infection (beginning with urethral colonization of enteric organisms via urethral massage) is more plausible and consistent with the clinical features mentioned in the vignette.\n(Choice D) Poor personal genital hygiene is a predisposing factor for UTI. It is not the mechanism by which UTIs occur.\n(Choices B and C) Hematogenous or lymphatic spread of infection causing UTIs may be seen in patients with distant foci of infection or immunosuppression. These are not very common phenomena."

He has an arterio-venous fistula placed for a possible dialysis. His medications are insulin, furosemide, atorvastatin, metoprolol and levothyroxine. After having his blood drawn for some laboratory studies today, he bleeds persistently. Laboratory studies show:\nHb 11.5 g/dL\nPlatelets 160,000/cmm\nBlood glucose 178 mg/dL\nBUN 56 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine 3.5 mg/dL\nHis baseline creatinine level is between 3.2-3.5 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his bleeding?",
    "options": [
      "A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation",
      "B. Platelet dysfunction",
      "C. Factor VIII deficiency",
      "D. Consumptive coagulopathy",
      "E. Thrombocytopenia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Abnormal hemostasis is a common manifestation seen in patients with chronic renal failure. Abnormal bleeding and bruising are characteristic of uremic coagulopathy. Nowadays, ecchymoses and epistaxis are the only major bleeding manifestations seen due to the advent of dialysis; however, GI bleeding, hemopericardium, subdural hematoma, and bleeding from surgical or invasive sites can still occur due to uremic coagulopathy.\nThe pathogenesis is multifactorial, but the major defect involves platelet-vessel wall and platelet-platelet interaction. Several uremic toxins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of platelet dysfunction seen in chronic renal failure (CRF), the chief among which is guanidinosuccinic acid. Activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT), prothrombin (PT), and thrombin times (TT) are generally normal. Bleeding time (BT) is reflective of platelet function, and is usually prolonged. The platelet count is normal, but there is platelet dysfunction that causes bleeding.\nA number of agents such as desmopressin (DDAVP), cryoprecipitate, and conjugated estrogens have been used to correct the coagulopathy in uremic patients. DDAVP increases the release of factor VIII:von Willebrand factor multimers from endothelial storage sites.\n(Choices A, C, D, and E) Disseminated intravascular coagulation, factor VIII deficiency, consumptive coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia are not common causes of bleeding in uremic patients. Furthermore, this patient's normal platelet count makes the diagnosis of DIC unlikely."

    "question": "A 64-year-old man is scheduled for hemodialysis due to end stage renal disease. He has a several year history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, gout, and diverticulosis. Six months ago, he was admitted for urosepsis. Recently, his hemoglobin has ranged between 8.5 to 9.5 g/dL. He has already been on iron therapy, and now you are considering erythropoietin injections twice weekly. Which of the following is most likely to be seen following erythropoietin therapy?",
    "options": [
      "A. Worsening of his hypertension",
      "B. Increase in insulin requirement",
      "C. Increased susceptibility to infections",
      "D. Deterioration in renal function",
      "E. Flare-up of gout"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Normochromic normocytic anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency is very common in patients with end stage renal disease. Recombinant erythropoietin is the treatment of choice; however, iron supplements should be given before erythropoietin in patients with evidence of iron deficiency. All patients with chronic renal failure and hematocrit <= 30% (or hemoglobin <=10g/dL) are candidates for recombinant erythropoietin therapy after iron deficiency has been ruled out. Erythropoietin is also indicated in hemodialysis patients who have symptoms attributed in part to anemia.\nSome of the most common side effects of erythropoietin therapy are:\n1. Worsening of hypertension: This is seen in approximately 30% of patients. 20-50% of patients receiving IV. erythropoietin will have more than a 10 mmHg rise in diastolic BP. This rise in BP is less common after the S.C. route of erythropoietin, as compared to the IV. route. Even hypertensive encephalopathy can occur when there is a rapid rise in BP. Exactly how erythropoietin causes hypertension is not well understood. Treatment includes fluid removal (by dialysis) and use of anti-hypertensive drugs (beta blockers and vasodilators are preferred). Prevention involves slowly raising the hematocrit, with a goal hematocrit of 30-35%.\n2. Headaches: These are seen in 15% of patients.\n3. Flu-like syndrome: This is seen in 5% of patients. It is responsive to anti-inflammatory drugs, and is less commonly seen with subcutaneous erythropoietin administration.\n4. Red cell aplasia: This is a rare, but potential side effect.\n(Choice B, C, D, and E) Erythropoietin use is not associated with an increase in insulin requirement, increased susceptibility to infections, deterioration in renal function, and flare-up of gout."

      "A. Hypertension",
      "B. Diabetes mellitus",
      "C. Multiple myeloma",
      "D. Analgesic abuse"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has benign nephrosclerosis secondary to hypertension. Hypertension is the second leading cause of end stage renal disease in the United States. It is inter-related with kidney disease; hypertension causes nephropathy, and vice versa. In particular, it is the renal vasculature that is exquisitely sensitive to damages incurred by systemic hypertension. Arteriosclerotic lesions of afferent and efferent renal arterioles and glomerular capillary tufts are the most common renal vascular lesions seen. As the hypertension progresses, there is a progressive decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The sequence of kidney damage evolves from nephrosclerosis to glomerulosclerosis. Nephrosclerosis is characterized by hypertrophy and intimal medial fibrosis of renal arterioles; whereas, glomerulosclerosis is characterized by progressive loss of the glomerular capillary surface area with glomerular and peritubular fibrosis. Microscopic hematuria and proteinuria occur due to these glomerular lesions. The kidneys generally decrease in size.\n(Choice B) Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the United States. Increased extracellular matrix, basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, and fibrosis characterize diabetes mellitus nephropathy. The sequence of pathological changes in the kidneys of a patient with diabetes mellitus is as follows:\n1. Within the first year of diabetes mellitus - Glomerular hyperperfusion and renal hypertrophy with increase in glomerular filtration rate.\n2. First five years of diabetes mellitus - Glomerular basement membrane thickening, glomerular hypertrophy, and mesangial volume expansion with glomerular filtration rate returning to normal.\n3. Within 5-10 years of diabetes mellitus - Microalbuminuria, which later progresses to overt nephropathy.\n(Choice C) Some degree of renal insufficiency is seen in approximately 50% of patients with multiple myeloma along the course of their disease. This is due to obstruction of the distal and collecting tubules by large laminated casts consisting mainly of Bence-Jones proteins. Amyloid deposition and infiltration of the kidney by plasma cells are commonly seen.\n(Choice D) Analgesic abuse nephropathy is primarily a tubulointerstitial disease characterized by focal glomerulosclerosis."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician due to the recent onset of occipital headaches. She has taken acetaminophen several times, but the pain returns. She has no fever or visual problems. She has not had similar episodes in the past. She has no history of serious illness. Her temperature is 36.1C (98F), blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination shows a right-sided renal bruit. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. ACE inhibitors",
      "B. Furosemide",
      "C. Angioplasty with stent placement",
      "D. Surgery",
      "E. Oral prednisone"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation (i.e., headache, elevated blood pressure, renal bruit) is highly suggestive of renovascular hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis. The usual cause of renal artery stenosis in young adults is fibromuscular dysplasia. In older patients, the cause is usually an atheromatous plaque. The goals of treatment are to decrease blood pressure and restore perfusion to the ischemic kidney. Interventional therapy is more effective than medical management alone; hence, angioplasty with stent placement is the best treatment option for this patient.\n(Choice A) Medical therapy alone is only partially effective. Although ACE inhibitors with diuretics offer good control of blood pressure, such drugs are unable to preserve the deteriorating kidney function for too long. Medical therapy alone is thus reserved for older patients with renal artery stenosis (due to atherosclerosis) who are not good candidates for surgery, or refuse surgery. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in bilateral renal artery stenosis.\n(Choice B) Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can help decrease blood pressure, but this patient would benefit more from angioplasty with stent placement.\n(Choice D) For patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, surgery is recommended only if angioplasty fails. Angioplasty with stent placement remains the treatment of choice in this patient.\n(Choice E) Oral prednisone has no role in the treatment of this patient."

      "F. Corticosteroids",
      "G. Kidney transplantation",
      "H. Liver transplantation"
    ],
    "answer": "H",
    "explanation": "Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is one of the most dangerous complications of end stage liver disease, occurring in up to 10% of patients with cirrhosis. HRS is characterized by decreased glomerular filtration in the absence of shock, proteinuria, or another clear cause of renal dysfunction, and a failure to respond to a 1.5 L normal saline bolus. It is thought to result from renal vasoconstriction in response to decreased total renal blood flow and vasodilatory substance synthesis. There are two subtypes of HRS. Type 1 HRS is rapidly progressive; most patients die within 10 weeks without treatment. Type 2 HRS progresses more slowly, with an average survival of 3-6 months. The most common causes of death are infection and hemorrhage. Unfortunately, no medication has consistently proven beneficial in HRS and the mortality for HRS patients placed on dialysis is very high. Liver transplantation is the only intervention with established benefit.\n(Choice A) Diuretics may worsen HRS.\n(Choice B) Unfortunately, ACE inhibitors are of no benefit to patients with HRS.\n(Choice C) Low-dose dopamine increases renal vasodilation but has not proven beneficial in treating HRS in a number of clinical trials.\n(Choice H) Interestingly, the kidneys of patients with HRS are essentially normal on biopsy and patients’ renal function improves with liver transplantation."

      "E. Nephrolithiasis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described (a woman with chronic headaches presenting with painless hematuria) is very typical for analgesic nephropathy. The prevalence of analgesic nephropathy in the general population is controversial, but it is probably underestimated. It is believed that several years of analgesic abuse is required to induce this condition characterized by chronic tubulointerstitial damage. Hematuria in these patients is commonly due to renal papillary necrosis. It results from papillary ischemia induced by analgesic-mediated vasoconstriction of medullary blood vessels (vasa recta). Sometimes hematuria is prominent, and clots may form causing renal colic.\n(Choice A) Malignancy may cause painless hematuria, but it is less likely in this young woman.\n(Choice B) Glomerulopathy is typically accompanied by more characteristic changes on urinalysis (deformed red blood cells, significant proteinuria and casts).\n(Choice D) Infection presents with dysuria, inflammatory changes on urinalysis and sometimes fever.\n(Choice E) Renal colic accompanied by hematuria is typical for nephrolithiasis."

    "question": "A 73-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of lower abdominal pain and nausea. He denies any vomiting or diarrhea, and his last bowel movement was two days ago. The patient also notes that several days ago he began taking amitriptyline for chronic neck pain. He does not smoke or consume alcohol. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 160/70 mmHg and his heart rate is 100/min. His lung fields are clear to auscultation.

      "A. Abdominal CT scan",
      "B. Upright abdominal x-ray",
      "C. Barium enema",
      "D. Broad spectrum antibiotics",
      "E. Urinary catheterization",
      "F. IV fluids, analgesics, and observation"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with abdominal pain and suprapubic fullness several days after starting amitriptyline for chronic pain. This presentation is consistent with amitriptyline-induced urinary retention. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic properties. Because both the detrusor muscle and urethral sphincter are under muscarinic control, anticholinergic agents will reduce detrusor contraction and prevent urethral sphincter relaxation. The result is urinary retention.\nUrinary catheterization would serve two purposes in this case. First, it can document a postvoid residual bladder volume of greater than 50 ml, which is considered diagnostic of urinary retention. Plus, catheterization will provide symptomatic relief as it drains urine from the bladder. The patient should also discontinue amitriptyline therapy.\n(Choice A) An abdominal CT scan would reveal a distended bladder in this patient and may also show hydronephrosis. However, CT scans are much more expensive and time consuming than urinary catheterization and will not provide symptomatic relief.\n(Choice B) An upright abdominal x-ray may show a distended bladder but it is not a reliable test for evaluating urinary retention. Abdominal x-rays are especially helpful for diagnosing ileus or small bowel obstruction.\n(Choice C) Barium enemas are used to diagnose luminal abnormalities of the colon, like colon cancer or diverticulosis.\n(Choice D) Broad-spectrum antibiotics are appropriate when a urinary tract infection with urinary retention is suspected. This patient does not complain of fever, chills, or dysuria, making infection less likely.\n(Choice F) IV fluids, analgesics, and observation are the treatment for nephrolithiasis, or kidney stones. Patients with kidney stones typically present with intense flank pain and hematuria, not suprapubic fullness. IV fluids would actually exacerbate this particular patient's symptoms."

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Analgesic nephropathy is the most common form of drug-induced chronic renal failure. It accounts for 3-5% of end stage renal disease in the USA, and is most commonly seen in females (peak at age 50-55 years) who habitually use combined analgesics (e.g., aspirin and naproxen). It is generally seen after cumulative ingestion of 2-3 kg (4.4-6.6 lbs) of the index drug. Papillary necrosis and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis are the most common pathologies seen. Polyuria and sterile pyuria (WBC casts may also be seen) are early manifestations. Microscopic hematuria and renal colic may occur following sloughing of renal papilla. Hypertension, mild proteinuria, and impaired urinary concentration commonly occur as the disease advances. In severe cases, nephrotic range proteinuria can be seen. Patients with chronic analgesic abuse are also more likely to develop premature aging, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and urinary tract cancer.\n(Choice A) Acute tubular necrosis causes acute renal failure, rather than insidious progression of renal dysfunction. It is most commonly seen in ischemic or nephrotoxic acute renal failure. Muddy brown granular casts are characteristic.\n(Choice B) Glomerulonephritis manifests as nephritic syndrome. Hematuria (RBC casts), edema, hypertension, and proteinuria are characteristic.\n(Choice D) Chronic pyelonephritis can cause chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis; however, it is associated with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and symptoms such as fever, back pain, and dysuria."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the general population, but the rates are declining. Interestingly, this recent trend has not been observed in the dialysis population. Cardiovascular disease remains as the most common cause of death in dialysis patients. It accounts for approximately 50% of deaths in this group of patients. Of these deaths, 20% are attributed to acute myocardial infarction and approximately 60% to sudden cardiac deaths.\nThe following risk factors are associated with cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients:\n- Risk factors not related to dialysis: A large number of patients on dialysis already have multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These are:\n  - Hypertension (96%)\n  - Diabetes (54%)\n  - Low serum HDL cholesterol (33%)\n  - Left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG criteria (22%)\n  - Coronary artery disease: Approximately 75% of patients with total end-stage renal disease have at least a 50% narrowing of at least one coronary artery.\n  - Increased age: The average age of patients at the start of dialysis is about 60 years.\n- Additional risk factors due to end stage renal disease and dialysis are:\n  - End stage renal disease: This, by itself, is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n  - Anemia.\n  - Metabolic abnormality, particularly hyperphosphatemia, and increased PTH levels.\n  - Increased homocysteine levels: These are due to impaired metabolism and decreased removal.\n  - Accelerated atherogenesis in dialysis patients: This is due to enhanced oxidant stress due to uremia and bio-incompatible renal replacement therapies.\n  - Increased calcium intake (calcium is given to correct hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients): This enhances coronary artery calcification.\n  - Inhibition of NO: This is a common finding in dialysis patients, and can cause vasoconstriction and hypertension.\n(Choice C) Infection is also a common cause of death in dialysis patients. It accounts for approximately 15-20% of deaths, and is most commonly related to vascular access (line sepsis).\n(Choice E) Withdrawal from dialysis accounts for 20% of deaths in dialysis patients.\n(Choice D) Patients on dialysis are not at increased risk for any cancer.\n(Choice B) Stroke can occur secondary to cardiovascular disease; thus, cardiovascular disease remains as the most common cause of death in dialysis patients."

    "question": "A 15-year-old boy comes to the physician because of hematuria and lower abdominal pain. This is his third episode of hematuria in the past 2 years. He has a family history of renal disease. His temperature is 37.1C (98.9F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. Examination shows mild sensorineural deafness bilaterally. Urinalysis shows hematuria and proteinuria. Laboratory studies show BUN of 50 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL; serum complement levels are normal. Renal biopsy shows foam cells, and immunofluorescence shows no immunoglobulins or complement. Electron microscopy shows alternating areas of thinned and thickened capillary loops with splitting of GBM. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This is a familial disorder which usually presents in childhood as recurrent gross hematuria and proteinuria. Sensorineural deafness usually occurs. Electron microscopy findings include alternating areas of thinned and thickened capillary loops with splitting of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).\n(Choice M) Thin basement membrane disease is also a familial disorder, but it presents in adulthood as microscopic hematuria without proteinuria. Renal biopsy reveals a markedly thinned basement membrane.\n(Choice E) Benign recurrent hematuria is asymptomatic. Renal biopsy is normal in most cases. This condition has an excellent prognosis."

She was hypotensive at the scene and received 7 liters of fluids, which included crystalloids, blood, and fresh frozen plasma. She apparently had significant external blood loss from multiple fractures and skin loss. She undergoes surgery, after which she is transferred to the ICU and receives continuous IV fluids and vasopressors. Her laboratory studies 24 hours after the accident show the following:\nHb 9.5 g/dL\nWBC 15,000/cmm\nPlatelets 130,000/cmm\nBUN 34 mg/dL\nSerum Creatinine 2.2 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most likely microscopic finding on urinalysis?",

      "E. Fatty casts",
      "F. Eosinophils"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The clinical picture of this patient is highly suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following hypovolemic shock. Her serum BUN and Cr ratio is less than 20:1. Other findings that support this diagnosis are:\n1. Urine osmolality of 300-350 mOsm/L (but never <=300)\n2. Urine Na of >=20 mEq/L\n3. FE-Na >=2%\nProlonged hypotension from any cause can lead to ATN. The hallmark findings on urinalysis are muddy brown granular casts consisting of renal tubular epithelial cells: this is a nonspecific, but very sensitive finding for ATN.\n(Choice A) Broad casts are seen in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). These arise in the dilated tubules of enlarged nephrons that have undergone compensatory hypertrophy in response to the reduced renal mass. Waxy casts, which are shiny and translucent, are also generally seen in chronic renal disease.\n(Choice C) RBC casts are indicative of glomerular disease or vasculitis.\n(Choice D) WBC casts are definitive evidence that urinary WBCs originate in the kidney. These are seen in cases of interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, etc.\n(Choice E) Fatty casts are seen in conditions causing nephrotic syndrome. Hyaline casts are composed almost entirely of protein and pass unchanged along the urinary tract; these may be seen in asymptomatic individuals and in patients with pre-renal azotemia."

    "question": "A 56-year-old male with a long history of diabetes mellitus complains of nocturnal urinary frequency, occasional dribbling and difficulty completing his stream. His past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction two years ago and moderately decreased visual acuity. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg and his heart rate is 70/min. There is a carotid bruit auscultated on the left side as well as trace ankle edema. Postvoid bladder catheterization yields 80 ml of urine. Dipstick urinalysis reveals 2+ protein and 3-4 WBC/hpf. The patient's serum creatinine level is 2.4 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his renal dysfunction?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ascending infection",
      "B. Obstructive uropathy",
      "C. Microangiopathy",
      "D. Renal hypoperfusion",
      "E. Cystic kidney disease"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This diabetic patient has renal insufficiency (given his elevated serum creatinine) and a moderate level of proteinuria. The most likely explanation for the abnormalities on dipstick urinalysis is microangiopathy related to diabetic glomerulosclerosis.\nIn diabetic patients with moderate proteinuria and progressive renal insufficiency, diabetic glomerulosclerosis is commonly responsible. Approximately 50% of type 1 and type 2 diabetics develop moderate or severe proteinuria over the course of the disease. In general, the proteinuria becomes evident 12 to 22 years after the clinical onset of diabetes and progresses to chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease within the subsequent 4 to 5 years. However, this sort of overt proteinuria is preceded by mild or trace protein leakage into the urine, termed “microalbuminuria,” which may actually become detectable within a few years of the onset of diabetes.\n(Choice B) The above patient does have some bladder outlet obstruction as evidenced by his nocturnal urinary frequency, dribbling, and postvoid residual greater than 50cc. This is most likely the result of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), the commonest cause of urinary retention in males over age 50. However, mild BPH would not cause renal insufficiency unless a complete bladder outlet obstruction was present.\n(Choice D) Renal hypoperfusion can cause pre-renal azotemia, but this is unlikely in this patient as he has an elevated mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, renal hypoperfusion would not necessarily cause proteinuria.\n(Choice E) Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) can cause hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency, but the associated proteinuria is usually minimal or mild. Additionally, flank and/or abdominal pain and hematuria are generally present."

He previously developed chronic renal insufficiency despite being on enalapril and insulin. His renal function is getting worse day by day. A nephrologist is currently managing his renal condition. Which of the following long-term treatments would give the best survival rate for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hemodialysis",
      "B. Peritoneal dialysis",
      "C. Renal transplantation from a cadaver",
      "D. Renal transplantation from a living related donor",
      "E. Renal transplantation from a living unrelated donor"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "End stage renal disease is a progressive condition that is fatal if left untreated. Once end stage renal disease develops, there are only two treatment options available: dialysis or renal transplantation. The choice depends on the patient and co-morbid conditions; however, if both options are available, renal transplantation is preferred, as it is associated with better survival and quality of life.\nThe advantages of renal transplantation over dialysis are:\n1. Better survival and quality of life.\n2. Anemia, bone disease, and hypertension persist in spite of dialysis; these are better controlled with transplantation.\n3. Transplant patients have a return of normal endocrine, sexual, and reproductive functions, and enhanced energy levels; thus, returning to fulltime employment and more strenuous physical activity is possible.\n4. In diabetics, autonomic neuropathy persists or worsens after dialysis; whereas, it stabilizes or improves with transplantation.\n5. Expected survival rate after transplantation is 95% at one year and 88% at five years.\nThe major disadvantages of renal transplantation are difficulty in finding a donor, surgical risk and cost, and side effects of immunosuppression. Transplantation from a living related donor has the least graft rejection and best graft survival, followed by a living non-related donor, and cadaver graft (Choices C and E).\n(Choices A and B) Dialysis options include hemodialysis (home or in-center) or peritoneal dialysis (chronic ambulatory or cyclic peritoneal dialysis). In the US, 85% of patients have in-center hemodialysis, 15% have peritoneal dialysis, and approximately 1% have home hemodialysis. The choice depends on the patient. Peritoneal hemodialysis provides the patient with more control and mobility, but the risk of peritonitis is high. The five-year survival rate in non-diabetic patients who are on dialysis is 30-40%; whereas, in diabetics, it is 20%."

    "question": "A 17-year-old African American man comes to the physician after an episode of gross hematuria that resolved spontaneously. He has no other complaints. His past medical history is insignificant. He takes no medications. He smokes occasionally. He does not use drugs or alcohol. His temperature is 36.7C (98F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

      "D. Coagulopathy",
      "E. Acute cystitis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario, with a young black male presenting with painless hematuria, is typical for sickle cell trait. Episodes of painless hematuria are very characteristic. The cause of such hematuric episodes is believed to be papillary ischemia, which is due to the relatively low local oxygen partial pressure, and which predisposes the diseased red blood cells to sickling. Papillary necrosis can occur with massive hematuria, but the episodes are usually mild and resolve spontaneously.\n(Choices A and B) Rapidly resolved isolated hematuria without other symptoms is not characteristic for acute glomerulonephritis (hypertension, proteinuria, dysmorphic RBC, RBC casts) or interstitial nephritis (use of medications, rash, eosinophilia, eosinophiluria). Interstitial nephritis usually does not cause gross hematuria. Interstitial cystitis can cause hematuria.\n(Choice D) Coagulopathy is a distant possibility; especially if there is a positive family or personal history and recurrent hemarthroses.\n(Choice E) Acute cystitis is usually accompanied by dysuria and frequency. Urinalysis usually shows many WBC, many bacteria, positive nitrite, and esterase."

The clues to the correct diagnosis are hypertension, palpable bilateral abdominal masses and microhematuria. Intracranial berry aneurysm is a common complication, and is seen in 5 to 10% of the cases. Although such aneurysms are common and dangerous when coupled with hypertension, routine screening for intracranial aneurysms is not recommended.\nThe other major extra-renal complications of ADPKD are:\n1. Hepatic cysts - most common extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD\n2. Valvular heart disease - most often mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation\n3. Colonic diverticula\n4. Abdominal wall and inguinal hernia\n(Choice A) Liver necrosis is a rare complication of the disease.\n(Choice E) Aortic dissection can occur as a rare complication of severe hypertension, not polycystic kidney disease itself.\n(Choices C and D) Restrictive cardiomyopathy and pancreatic cancer are not associated with polycystic kidney disease."

It is well known that hepatitis B infection is associated with glomerular disease, especially membranous glomerulonephritis. The pathophysiology of this condition is not completely clear, but probably includes immune complex-induced glomerular damage. Immune complexes composed of hepatitis B antigens and antibodies have been implicated.

    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe back pain that began suddenly after he attempted to lift a heavy box. He says the pain radiates down his right thigh and leg and that coughing and moving make the pain ‘unbearable.’ The patient also complains of an inability to urinate since the pain started. On physical examination, he has no focal lower extremity weakness or numbness, and pinprick testing in the perianal area elicits a quick spasm of the anal sphincter. Rectal exam reveals an enlarged, smooth, nontender prostate. Which of the following best explains this patient's urinary retention?",
    "options": [
      "A. Severe pain",
      "B. Nerve root injury",
      "C. Detrusor instability",
      "D. Hypertonic bladder",

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient appears to have herniated an intervertebral disk, most likely L4/L5, and is most likely suffering from spinal nerve impingement. Classic symptoms of disk prolapse include unilateral radicular pain in a dermatomal distribution. Back tenderness due to spasm of the paraspinous muscles is common, and symptoms are usually worsened with straight leg raise testing. Fortunately, this patient has no saddle anesthesia and his sphincter tone is intact, so cauda equina syndrome is an unlikely explanation for his urinary retention. He does have benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) on physical examination, meaning that he likely needs to Valsalva in order to initiate and maintain a urinary stream. Because he has severe pain with coughing and movement, he is probably unable to generate sufficient intraabdominal pressure to overcome the resistance to flow caused by his BPH — hence urinary retention secondary to pain.\n(Choice B) A large midline disk herniation can cause nerve root injury known as cauda equina syndrome, a condition characterized by bladder atony with overflow incontinence, bilateral sciatica, saddle anesthesia and loss of anal sphincter tone.\n(Choice C) Detrusor instability, also known as urge incontinence, typically presents with incontinence preceded by sudden urinary urgency. It is caused by unregulated spontaneous contractions of the bladder that are unresponsive to cortical inhibition.\n(Choice D) Hypertonic bladder presents with constant urine dribbling due to unremitting contraction of the bladder and urethral sphincter hypotonia.\n(Choice E) Urethral injury typically occurs following trauma.

      "D. Initiate oral calcium and vitamin D replacement",
      "E. No intervention is required"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Circulating calcium exists in both free and bound states. Only 45% of circulating calcium is free and physiologically active; this is known as ionized calcium. The remainder is bound to albumin (40%), other proteins, organic anions, and inorganic anions.\nCalcium binds to albumin with a ratio of 0.8 mg/dL of calcium per 1.0 g/dL of albumin. Thus, every reduction in albumin by 1.0 g/dL reduces the measured serum calcium concentration by 0.8 mg/dL, though the ionized calcium concentration does not change. For patients with an abnormal serum albumin concentration (as in many with liver disease), a corrected calcium level can be calculated using the formula below. By convention, normal albumin is defined as 4.0 g/dL.\nCorrected Ca++ = 0.8(normal albumin – measured albumin) + measured calcium\nThus, this patient's corrected calcium is:\n0.8(4.0-2.5) + 7.4 mg/dL = 8.6 mg/dL\nA serum calcium concentration of 8.6 mg/dL is normal. Thus, this patient does not need intervention.\n(Choice A) Intravenous calcium gluconate is an appropriate therapy for patients with hyperkalemia or clinically significant hypocalcemia. This patient has neither.\n(Choice B) Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly recognized as a public health problem in the United States, particularly in the elderly. In patients with hypocalcemia, metabolic bone disease, or myalgias, it is appropriate for the physician to evaluate vitamin D stores by checking the 25(OH)-vitamin D level.\n(Choice C) HCTZ is a thiazide diuretic that decreases urinary calcium excretion and increases serum calcium concentration. It is a good choice in diuretic-requiring patients who have hypocalcemia or recurrent calcium renal stones. It is not as strong of a diuretic as furosemide, however, and will not maintain this patient's volume status as well as a loop diuretic.\n(Choice D) Oral calcium and vitamin D supplements are appropriate for patients with hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, vitamin D deficiency, or osteopenia. Thus, this patient does not require supplementation.\nEducational Objective:\nA significant percentage of circulating calcium is bound to albumin, but it is only the ionized, or free, form of calcium that is physiologically active. The following formula can be used to adjust the measured calcium concentration for changes in the serum albumin concentration:\nCorrected Ca++ = 0.8 (normal albumin – measured albumin) + measured calcium"

After a 2L normal saline infusion, the serum sodium is 126 mEq/l and the urine sodium excretion is\nincreased to 90 mEg/l. Which of the following is the mast likely cause of this patient's hyponatremia?",
    "options": [
      "A. Inappropriate ADH secretion",
      "B.Psychagenic polydipsia",
      "C. Surreptitious diuretic use",
      "D. Advanced liver disease",
      "E. Interstitial renal disease"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium value less than 130 mEq/L. It typically results from defects in the total body water balance. The underlying cause can be determined based on assessment of the serum osmolarity, extracellular fluid volume status, and urine sodium concentration as follows:\nSerum Osmolarity:\nHigh (>= 295 mOsm/kg) - Exogenous solutes (radiocontrast, mannitol)\nNormal (280-295 mOsm/kg) - Pseudohyponatremia (hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia, isotonic IV fluids)\nLow (<= 280 mOsm/kg) - Hypovolemic: UNa < 10 mEq/L (Dehydration, Vomiting, Diarrhea) or UNa >= 20 mEq/L (Renal salt loss, Mineralocorticoid deficiency); Euvolemic: Uosm < 300 mOsm/kg (Psychogenic polydipsia, Beer potomania); Hypervolemic: UNa < 10 mEq/L (CHF, Hepatic failure, Nephrotic syndrome)\nIn this patient, the serum osmolarity is low (260 mOsm/kg). His physical examination reveals no signs of fluid overload, suggesting that his hyponatremia is of the euvolemic type. The BUN and creatinine are normal with a BUN/Cr ratio less than 20, indicating adequate renal perfusion and function. The initial spot urine sodium is 45 mEq/L, which is inappropriately elevated considering the patient's hyponatremia (the kidneys should be retaining sodium maximally, giving a urine sodium less than 10 mEq/L). We can therefore conclude that this patient has euvolemic hyponatremia due to renal sodium losses. Given that the urine osmolarity is increased and greater than the serum osmolarity, the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the most appropriate diagnosis. ADH acts on the distal tubule and collecting ducts to increase free water reabsorption from the urine. Inappropriate secretion of ADH thus causes hyponatremia. Diagnostic criteria for SIADH include:\n1. Sosm < 270\n2. Uosm > Sosm\n3. UNa >= 20 mEq/L\n4. Absence of hypovolemia\n5. Normal renal, adrenal and thyroid function\n6. No obvious surgical, traumatic or painful stimulus known to activate the neuroendocrine stress response, including ADH release\n7. Absence of other known causes of hyponatremia\nThis patient meets the first four criteria, and based on the information given, may also meet the last three. In addition, when a normal saline fluid bolus is given, the urine sodium excretion appears to increase while the serum sodium is relatively unaffected, indicating that the kidneys are continuing to inappropriately excrete sodium and retain water under the influence of ADH.\n(Choice B) Psychogenic polydipsia would result in euvolemic hyponatremia because obligate sodium losses in the urine would decrease the plasma sodium concentration as the body attempted to eliminate the excess free water. The urine osmolality would be decreased.\n(Choices C & E) Diuretic overuse, interstitial nephritis and other renal salt-wasting conditions would cause hypovolemia, elevations in the BUN and BUN/Cr ratio, and possible isosthenuria (Uosm = Sosm) due to impaired renal concentrating ability.\n(Choice D) Advanced liver disease, particularly cirrhosis, would cause signs of total body water overload (ascites, interstitial edema) due to hypoalbuminemia (a result of decreased liver synthetic function). Widespread edema causes a relative depletion of intravascular volume, which causes the kidneys to maximally retain water. In this setting, renal sodium retention would be maximal resulting in a low UNa.\nEducational objective:\nSIADH is characterized by euvolemic hyponatremia, decreased serum osmolarity, elevated urine osmolarity (often greater than serum osmolarity), increased urine sodium concentration, and failure to correct with normal saline infusion."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Gastric outlet obstruction is a rare complication of chronic peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Prepyloric inflammation may lead to edema, fibrosis and scarring of the pylorus causing symptoms of early satiety and intractable vomiting. Persistent and prolonged vomiting from an obstruction typically results in dehydration (volume contraction) and a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. In this case, hypokalemia results both from renal potassium wasting in an effort to retain H+ as well as from hyperaldosteronism resulting from volume contraction. Emergent treatment includes nasogastric suctioning to decompress the stomach, hydration with sodium chloride, and intravenous potassium supplementation. Definitive treatment requires treatment of the ulcer and possible surgical intervention.\n(Choice A) Ammonium chloride may be used in the setting of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis to lower the pH of the ECF and urine, but it causes diuresis and would worsen the patient's volume contraction if used as a monotherapy.\n(Choice C) CaCl2 is not needed at this time. The patient's tetany is due to the decreased levels of ionized Ca++, which is secondary to the alkalosis. The levels of total Ca++ is normal.\n(Choice D) Furosemide is contraindicated in this patient because it may further worsen the volume deficit via diuresis. The patient's oliguria can be attributed to dehydration; adequate volume repletion should eventually result in diuresis.\n(Choice E) Sodium bicarbonate will worsen the underlying metabolic alkalosis.\nEducational Objective:\nGastric outlet obstruction typically presents with persistent vomiting, which leads to hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Emergent treatment includes nasogastric suctioning to decompress the stomach, hydration with sodium chloride, and potassium replacement."

      "E. Dialysis"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Repeated vomiting causes a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis resulting from vomiting can be separated into two phases: a generation phase and a maintenance phase. Initially, vomiting results in the loss of gastric fluids containing HCl, NaCl and water. The loss of H+ as HCl results in the unbalanced retention of HCO3-. Because of the loss of gastric acidity, there is no stimulus for HCO3- release by the pancreas. The HCO3- is instead retained in the blood leading to a metabolic alkalosis. This is the generation phase. Next, as a result of volume loss in the vomitus, the ECF volume is decreased leading to decreased renal perfusion pressure. The kidneys respond by increasing activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Aldosterone functions to retain water at the expense of H+ and K+ loss in the urine. The action of aldosterone, which causes hypokalemia and a contraction alkalosis, accounts for the maintenance phase of metabolic alkalosis resulting from vomiting. The first step in management of this condition is restoration of the ECF volume with intravenous normal saline and potassium. Volume restoration will decrease activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by restoring proper renal perfusion pressure.\n(Choice A) Ammonium chloride is given in severe forms of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, but this intervention carries greater risk than normal saline infusion due to its potential toxicity in liver failure.\n(Choice B) HCl is rarely used as an emergency therapy to treat severe forms of metabolic alkalosis due to its risk of hemolysis and the availability of better invasive interventions.\n(Choice C) Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic and as such would be contraindicated in a state of volume depletion.\n(Choice E) Patients with electrolyte and acid-base imbalances as well as renal failure will require dialysis to correct their acid-base derangement.\nEducational Objective:\nVolume resuscitation with normal saline will correct contraction alkalosis. Hypokalemia should be treated as well."

      "E. Increased gut absorption"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described is the victim of a house fire and has most likely suffered a smoke inhalation injury. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is the most common systemic toxicity seen in smoke inhalation. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity 250 times that of oxygen. Upon inhalation, CO displaces oxygen from hemoglobin thereby decreasing the hemoglobin binding sites available for oxygen and the oxygen content of the blood. Because CO binds so avidly to hemoglobin, it also is able to change the shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Specifically, CO causes a left shift of the curve and a shape change from sigmoid to asymptotic. This change disallows unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin in the tissues. By this twofold mechanism, CO poisoning causes decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues. This results in increased anaerobic metabolism by the tissues leading to increased lactic acid production and development of an anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice A) An increased metabolic rate may cause lactic acidosis if there is insufficient oxygen present in the tissues and anaerobic metabolism ensues. This is commonly seen with post seizure lactic acidosis.\n(Choice C) Reduced oxygen utilization by tissues does occur in CO poisoning because of the ability of CO to bind and inhibit cytochrome aa3, but CO binds to this enzyme with less affinity than oxygen. This is not the primary mechanism for acidosis in this case.\n(Choice D) Impaired excretion of lactic acid as well as other serum acids occurs in renal failure resulting in an anion-gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice E) Increased gut absorption of lactic acid may occur in cases of intestinal blind loop syndrome where excessive production and absorption of D-lactate causes a hypochloremic metabolic acidosis.\nEducational objective:\nLactic acidosis resulting from poor oxygen delivery to the tissues is known as type A lactic acidosis. Causes include CO poisoning and circulatory failure (shock)."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an alkaline pH and a primary increase in the serum bicarbonate level (>= 24 mEq/L). It can be classified into two broad categories, namely chloride-sensitive (hypochloremic, saline-responsive) and chloride-resistant (normochloremic, saline-unresponsive) metabolic alkalosis. Chloride-sensitive metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a urinary chloride level <= 20 mEq/day and signs of volume depletion. The common underlying pathophysiology in all causes of chloride-sensitive metabolic alkalosis involves ECF volume contraction. Volume contraction causes increased mineralocorticoid action, which in turn causes bicarbonate retention, H+ loss and K+ loss. The urinary chloride remains low due to avid renal retention of NaCl and water. Some causes of this condition are thiazide or loop diuretics and loss of gastric secretions, such as with surreptitious vomiting (i.e., purging in bulimia nervosa). This condition can be corrected with saline infusion to restore ECF volume.\n(Choice B) Persistent diarrhea causes a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice C) Chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a urinary chloride level >=20 mEq/day and ECF volume expansion. Some disorders associated with chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis are primary hyperaldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, Gitelman's syndrome, and excessive black licorice ingestion. Chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis is not corrected by saline infusion.\n(Choice D) All forms of renal tubular acidosis cause non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice E) Hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis.\nEducational Objective:\nMetabolic alkalosis can be classified into two broad categories, chloride-sensitive and chloride-resistant, based on urinary chloride levels and ECF volume status. Chloride sensitive metabolic alkalosis is associated with low urinary chloride excretion and volume contraction."

    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering from primary adrenal failure (Addison disease) resulting from invasion of the adrenal glands by M. tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a common cause of primary adrenal failure in geographic regions where this organism is endemic. Other granulomatous diseases, such as histoplasmosis, coccidicidomycosis, cryptococcosis and sarcoidosis, may cause this condition as well. Addison disease is characterized by decreased cortisol, adrenal sex hormone and aldosterone secretion. Normally, aldosterone acts on the distal tubules of the kidney to increase the reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions. If aldosterone is deficient, the kidney inappropriately loses sodium while retaining excessive potassium and hydrogen ions. This results in a normal anion gap, hyperkalemic, hyponatremic metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice A) Elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis is characteristically seen in the following conditions: ketoacidosis (alcoholic, diabetic, starvation), intoxications (methanol, formaldehyde, salicylate, ethylene glycol, paraldehyde, INH, iron, metformin), tissue hypoxia (ischemia, carbon monoxide, cyanide) and renal failure.\n(Choice C) Metabolic alkalosis occurs with vomiting (most common), hyperaldosteronism and excessive volume contraction (thiazides, loop diuretics).\n(Choice D) Respiratory acidosis is caused by conditions that impair proper ventilation.\n(Choice E) Respiratory alkalosis is caused by conditions resulting in hyperventilation.\nEducational objective:\nAldosterone deficiency, which occurs in Addison disease, causes a non-anion gap, hyperkalemic, hyponatremic metabolic acidosis."

    "question": "A four-week-old male infant is brought to the emergency department because of persistent vomiting\nimmediately after feeding for the past several days. Examination shows an emaciated infant with dry mucus\nmembranes. An olive-shaped mass is palpated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Which of the\nfollowing acid-base abnormalities is most likely in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A.7.10,80, 24",
      "B. 7.40 40, 24",
      "C.7.55,46 42",
      "D.7.62 21, 21",
      "E. 7.62, 30,30"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This disorder is more common in males and occurs in slightly less than 1% of births. Classically an affected infant will present in the first few weeks of life with persistent nonbilious vomiting following feedings. The loss of acidic gastric fluid via vomiting causes a metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, the loss of large volumes of fluid via vomiting leads to contraction alkalosis due to the action of aldosterone. In order to compensate for the metabolic alkalosis, the respiratory system responds via hypoventilation to create a secondary respiratory acidosis. The patient described is expected to have a primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. This is characterized by a plasma pH greater than 7.45, PaCO2 greater than 40 mm Hg and HCO3- greater than 24 mEq/L.\n(Choice A) Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a pH less than 7.35, and primary increase in PaCO2. Hypoventilation syndromes such as narcotic overdose and neuromuscular diseases cause respiratory acidosis.\n(Choice B) A normal acid base status is characterized by a pH of approximately 7.40, HCO3- of 24 mEq/L (22 – 26 mEq/L) and PaCO2 ranging from 35-45.\n(Choice D) Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a pH greater than 7.45 and a primary decrease in PaCO2.\n(Choice E) Mixed metabolic and respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a pH greater than 7.45, a primary increase in HCO3- and a simultaneous primary decrease in PaCO2. This combination of metabolic and respiratory alkalosis can result in extremes of pH.\nEducational Objective:\nSevere vomiting produces metabolic alkalosis due to the unbalanced loss of hydrogen ions in the gastric fluid. Contraction alkalosis also occurs in this setting due to ECF volume contraction resulting from vomiting. The decrease in ECF volume activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system causing water retention at the expense of hydrogen ion losses."

      "G. Insulin therapy",
      "H. Acetazolamide"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This woman has a metabolic alkalosis and signs of volume depletion. Given her age, gender, vigorous exercise regimen, and lanugo hair on exam, this is particularly concerning for surreptitious vomiting in a patient with an eating disorder. Metabolic alkalosis can generally be divided into two categories: saline-responsive and saline-resistant. Saline-responsive conditions have a urine chloride concentration <= 20 mEq/L and are due to gastrointestinal proton loss (e.g., vomiting), volume depletion, or diuretic abuse. This patient likely has a saline-responsive metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting and hypovolemia, and her acid-base status will improve with normal saline infusion.\n(Choice A) This patient has hypokalemia and normal serum calcium. Calcium infusion will not be beneficial.\n(Choice C) Sodium bicarbonate will provide some volume resuscitation but will exacerbate her metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice D) Loop diuretics will worsen volume depletion and are strongly discouraged in patients with hypovolemia.\n(Choice E) Hyperventilation will decrease her pCO2 and cause a concurrent respiratory alkalosis that would compound her problem.\n(Choice F) Breathing into a bag increases the amount of inspired CO2 and will increase her pCO2. This will decrease her serum pH somewhat but does not work towards reversing the underlying metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice H) Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that will decrease serum bicarbonate production. This may improve her alkalosis somewhat, however, it is a diuretic that will worsen her volume status and thus may exacerbate her saline-responsive alkalosis. Additionally, acetazolamide causes hypokalemia, an undesirable side effect in this woman who already has a low serum potassium concentration.\nEducational objective:\nSaline-responsive metabolic alkalosis has a urine chloride concentration less than 20 mEq/L and is typically due to conditions that cause hypovolemia or GI proton loss. It is treated with infusions of isotonic saline."

    "question": "A 24-year-old female is brought to the emergency room because of dizziness and near syncope. She says\nthat every time she stands up, she feels lightheaded. She has no significant past medical problems. She\ndoes nate having braken up with her boyfriend three months ago, which has caused her to have decreased\nappetite and an associated ten pound weight loss. She has also missed her last twa menstrual periods. She\ndenies using tobacco, alcohol ar drugs. On physical examination, her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F).

    "options": [
      "A. Low calaric intake",
      "B. Self-induced vomiting",
      "C. Laxative abuse",
      "D. Diuretic abuse",
      "E. Mineralocorticoid deficiency"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This young woman has orthostatic hypotension, which likely explains her dizziness. In addition, she has abnormalities of her serum and urine electrolytes. Diuretic abuse, a technique sometimes used by individuals desperate for weight loss, can cause hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and dizziness by increasing the elimination of sodium, potassium and water by the kidneys, and would explain this patient's pattern of electrolyte abnormalities (Choice D). This patient's recent break-up was likely the catalyst for this dangerous behavior. Other causes of orthostatic hypotension include anything that decreases intravascular volume or vascular tone. Decreased fluid intake, polyuria, and diarrhea decrease intravascular volume. Decreased vascular tone can be caused by autonomic neuropathy or medications. Commonly implicated medications include anti-hypertensive and psychiatric drugs.\n(Choice A) Low caloric intake causes weight loss secondary to wasting of muscle mass and fat. It could also lead to electrolyte abnormalities, but elevated urine electrolytes would not be expected.\n(Choice B) Self-induced vomiting may lead to low serum sodium and potassium, and the associated loss of fluid can cause orthostatic hypotension. However, urinary sodium will be low as the kidneys try to conserve water by maximally resorbing sodium and water.\n(Choice C) Laxative abuse leads to loss of significant amounts of water from the colon, causing dehydration, orthostatic hypotension, and weight loss. It may also cause electrolyte imbalances. However, this patient is losing electrolytes via her genitourinary system.\n(Choice E) Mineralocorticoid deficiency can lead to wasting of sodium and water, but serum potassium levels are increased in such patients.\nEducational objective:\nDiuretic abuse leads to increased excretion of water and electrolytes by the kidneys. Dehydration, weight loss, orthostatic hypotension as well as hypokalemia and hyponatremia result. Urinary sodium and potassium will be elevated. Patients with eating disorders sometimes abuse diuretics to induce weight loss."

    "explanation": "Chronic alcoholism eventually results in multiple electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. In this vignette therefore, it is likely that the patient also has low magnesium levels. Hypomagnesemia is notorious for causing refractory hypokalemia. Mg is an important cofactor for potassium uptake and maintenance of intracellular potassium levels. For these reasons, magnesium levels in alcoholics must also be checked and corrected to successfully correct the coexisting hypokalemia.

It does not directly cause hypokalemia.\n(Choice C) Alcohol withdrawal, by itself, does not cause refractory hypokalemia.\n(Choice E) Thiamine deficiency is also seen in alcoholics; however, it does not cause refractory hypokalemia.\n(Choice F) Hypoalbuminemia is commonly seen in alcoholics. It may indicate poor nutrition, decreased hepatic synthetic function, or proteinuria. It may result in spurious hypocalcemia, since calcium is largely albumin-bound. It does not cause hypokalemia.\n(Choice G) Type I or II renal tubular acidosis (RTA) can cause hypokalemia, however, this patient cannot have RTA because he is not acidotic (i.e., the bicarbonate level is normal).\nEducational Objective:\nChronic alcoholics typically present with multiple electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypomagnesemia causes refractory hypokalemia; therefore it is important to correct the magnesium along with the potassium levels to be able to correct the electrolyte abnormalities of such patients."

      "D. Insulin and glucose",
      "E. High-dose inhaled 32 agonist",
      "F.Mormal saline"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has hyperkalemia due to tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperkalemia is life-threatening, and all physicians should be comfortable treating it. There are three goals of therapy: to normalize cellular electrical activity with calcium, to drive potassium intracellularly, and to decrease the total body potassium content. In general, potassium can be shifted intracellularly more quickly than it can be removed from the body. Of the options listed, insulin and glucose administration is the most rapid-acting, driving potassium intracellularly in 15-30 minutes. (Glucose is given along with insulin to avoid hypoglycemia.) However, intracellular shifts are usually transient, so efforts to decrease the total body potassium must still be made, though this occurs over a longer time frame.\n(Choice A) Hemodialysis is the most definitive way to remove potassium from the body in patients with renal failure. However, it often takes at least 1 hour to set up in a patient who has a dialysis catheter or fistula in place.\n(Choice B) Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate®) is a potassium-binding resin that decreases total body potassium content by catharsis in the gut. Sodium is exchanged for potassium. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate takes at least 1-2 hours to work.\n(Choice C and E) Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes renal potassium excretion. High-dose inhaled B2-agonists (e.g., albuterol) transiently move potassium into cells. Neither is as effective as insulin and glucose at decreasing the serum potassium level, and both usually take longer to exert their effects.\n(Choice F) Normal saline is not a treatment for hyperkalemia.\nEducational Objective:\nHyperkalemia is a medical emergency. Therapy involves three steps: membrane stabilization with calcium, shifting potassium intracellularly, and decreasing the total body potassium content. Insulin/glucose administration is the quickest way to decrease the serum potassium concentration."

      "C. Glucocorticoid treatment",
      "D. Obstructive sleep apnea",
      "E. Warsening respiratory failure"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation of hypoxia and wheezing in a smoker is most consistent with a COPD exacerbation. The findings of elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema in the presence of clear lungs suggest that pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale has begun to develop. The patient was appropriately started on glucocorticoids and bronchodilators for his COPD exacerbation. Loop diuretics such as furosemide are often used to lower right ventricular filling volumes and reduce peripheral edema. However, these must be used carefully as these patients are prone to develop reduced cardiac output with diuretics. This patient's doubling in creatinine and BUN is likely secondary to prerenal renal failure from a reduction in cardiac output. The patient was mildly acidotic upon admission secondary to a respiratory acidosis with a compensatory elevation in bicarbonate. Now the patient's bicarbonate level has dropped likely secondary to a superimposed metabolic acidosis from uremia, but he has enough preservation of lung function thanks to treatment of his COPD exacerbation to mount a compensatory reduction in pCO2 in order to keep his overall pH at roughly the same level. The development of hypokalemia in this patient is likely secondary to the furosemide.\n(Choice B) Ketoacidosis is unlikely in this patient because the glucose is only minimally elevated. An elevated anion gap is also typically seen in ketoacidosis, but this patient's anion gap [Na - (HCO3 + Cl)] is 139 - (18 + 112) = 9, which is within normal limits (normal = 8-12). Renal failure can result in either a gap or nongap acidosis.\n(Choice C) Glucocorticoids can rarely result in hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but this patient has a metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice D) Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to a chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation due to hypoventilation, and could present with laboratory values similar to those seen in this patient initially, however, it would not provide an explanation for the change in this patient's acid-base status over the course of his hospitalization.\n(Choice E) This patient's pH stayed roughly the same despite a reduction in bicarbonate level secondary to his acute renal failure and development of a metabolic acidosis. This is only possible because his lung function improved to the point where he was able to reduce his pCO2 enough to compensate for the reduction in bicarbonate.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with COPD often have chronic CO2 retention resulting in respiratory acidosis. Diuretics are often used in the treatment of COPD patients who have developed cor pulmonale, but must be used cautiously because these patients are at risk of having a reduction in cardiac output with subsequent development of renal failure."

      "C. Metabalic alkalosis",
      "D. Respiratory acidosis",
      "E. Respiratory alkalosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Human blood pH is normally maintained at 7.35-7.45 by various mechanisms, the most significant of which are the regulation of CO2, bicarbonate and hydrogen atoms by the lungs and kidneys. A pH of more than 7.45 is considered alkalosis, and a pH of less than 7.35 is considered acidosis. The PCO2 and HCO3- values can then be used to differentiate between a respiratory or metabolic cause of the acid-base disturbance. Sometimes mixed acid-base disorders can exist with a pH that is within the normal range; therefore, it is necessary to study the HCO3- and PCO2 values to properly identify the correct acid-base status. The normal HCO3- is 24 mEq/L, and normal PaCO2 is 40 mm Hg. Any deviation from these normal values is indicative of an acid-base disorder. Metabolic acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in the concentration of HCO3-, whereas respiratory acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in PCO2. A primary rise in PaCO2 (respiratory acidosis) or fall in plasma HCO3- (metabolic acidosis) reduces the pH, whereas a primary fall in PCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) or a rise in plasma HCO3- (metabolic alkalosis) increases the pH. In this case, the patient has a metabolic alkalosis because the pH is greater than 7.45 and there is a primary rise in the plasma HCO3-. The cause of his metabolic alkalosis is vomiting (H+ loss) secondary to NSAID-induced gastritis. The increase in PCO2 is the result of early respiratory compensation for the primary metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice A) A normal acid-base profile is pH 7.4, HCO3- 24 mEq/L, and PCO2 40 mm Hg. As mentioned, the pH can be normal in mixed acid-base disturbances, so examination of all three of these indices is essential.\n(Choice B) Metabolic acidosis is indicated by a pH below 7.35 and an HCO3- below 24 mEq/L. The PCO2 may be decreased by respiratory compensation.\n(Choice D) Respiratory acidosis is indicated by a pH below 7.35 and a PCO2 above 40 mm Hg (CO2 is regarded as an acid). The HCO3- may be increased by renal compensation.\n(Choice E) Respiratory alkalosis is indicated by a pH above 7.35 and a PCO2 below 40 mm Hg. The HCO3- may be decreased by renal compensation.\nEducational Objective:\nThe main causes of metabolic alkalosis include exogenous administration of alkali, removal of acidic gastric secretions due to vomiting or NG tube aspiration, renal hydrogen ion loss due to mineralocorticoid excess, and contraction alkalosis."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has Cushing's syndrome, a disorder caused by excessive systemic corticosteroid levels. Iatrogenic steroid administration is the most common cause, but Cushing's syndrome can also result from a patient's own overproduction of cortisol. The signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include fatigue, weight gain, easy bruising, central adiposity, proximal muscle weakness, hyperglycemia, osteopenia and osteoporosis, hypertension, acne, cataracts, and susceptibility to infections.\nHypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients with excessive cortisol. It occurs because most corticosteroids have some mineralocorticoid activity and will bind to aldosterone receptors in the kidney, causing renal potassium wasting. If severe, the hypokalemia of Cushing's syndrome can be treated with an aldosterone antagonist like spironolactone.\n(Choice A) Hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia, occurs in patients with Cushing's syndrome.\n(Choice C) Hypercalcemia is an occasional finding in adrenal failure but is not frequently observed in patients with Cushing's syndrome. In fact, corticosteroids are often used to treat hypercalcemia, for example in sarcoid and lymphoma patients.\n(Choice D) Due to the direct effects of corticosteroids on the aldosterone receptor, hypervolemic hypernatremia can occasionally be seen in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Hyponatremia is not observed.\n(Choice E) Hypomagnesemia can be caused by poor nutrition, diuretic use, malabsorption, and alcohol abuse. It is not strongly associated with Cushing's syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nCushing's syndrome is caused by corticosteroid excess. Hypokalemia and hypernatremia are the electrolyte abnormalities most commonly observed."

      "E. Respiratory acidosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has an anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is evidenced by his acidic pH (< 7.35) and his severe primary decrease in HCO3- (<= 24 mEq/L). Normally, the anion gap is made up of negatively charged molecules such as protein, citrate, phosphate and sulfate that are normally present in serum. These molecules account for the normal anion gap value of 6 – 12 mEq/L. The AG can be calculated using the following formula:\nAG = Measured cations (positive charge) - Measured anions (negative charge)\nBecause the major cation in the serum is Na+, and the major anions in the serum are Cl- and HCO3-, the formula for plasma AG can be simplified as follows:\nAG = Na+ - (HCO3- + Cl-)\nUsing this formula with the patient's laboratory values, the calculated anion gap is 28 mEq/L, an abnormally elevated value. An increase in the AG indicates the presence of non-chloride-containing acids that contain inorganic (phosphate, sulfate), organic (ketoacids, lactate, uremic organic anions), exogenous (salicylate or ingested toxins with organic acid production) or unidentified anions.\nThe most common causes of anionic gap metabolic acidosis and their corresponding unmeasured anions that compose the anion gap are:\n1. Lactic acidosis (lactate)\n2. Ketoacidosis (beta-hydroxy butyrate, acetoacetic acid)\n3. Methanol / formaldehyde ingestion (formic acid)\n4. Ethylene glycol ingestion (glycolic acid, oxalic acid)\n5. Salicylate poisoning (salicylic, lactic, sulfuric and phosphoric acids)\n6. Uremia (ESRD) (impaired excretion of H+)\nEducational objective:\nThe anion gap (AG) represents the concentration of unmeasured serum anions. In anion gap metabolic acidosis, the anion gap is increased by the abnormal presence of non-chlorinated acids in the serum."

      "E. Right lower lobe atelectasis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Upon admission, this patient's acid-base status was borderline acidotic, whereas now he is mildly alkalemic. The most likely intervention to have resulted in this change in acid-base status is administration of a loop diuretic. Volume overload and ascites are common complications in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, and loop diuretics such as furosemide are a frequently used treatment, often in combination with spironolactone. Loop diuretics function by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl carrier in the loop of Henle which results in increased excretion of sodium. Loop diuretics also increase excretion of potassium and can lead to hypokalemia, which explains the drop in this patient's potassium level. This patient's elevation in BUN and creatinine is likely secondary to reduction in circulating blood volume and subsequent mild prerenal renal failure. Loop diuretics result in increased distal solute delivery as well as an increase in aldosterone level which combine to result in increased hydrogen ion excretion leading to metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice A) This patient has likely developed mild acute renal failure as evidenced by his mild increase in BUN and creatinine. However, this is not the best answer as acute renal failure by itself would tend to cause metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Loop diuretic use would explain all of the changes in this patient's laboratory values.\n(Choice B) Bowel ischemia results in a lactic acidosis, but this patient has a metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice D) Opioid medication may result in hypoventilation and subsequent respiratory acidosis. While this can result in a compensatory increase in bicarbonate level, this patient's pH of 7.47 is more consistent with a primary metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice E) This patient has an elevated pH and elevated bicarbonate, thus the problem must be at least in part a metabolic alkalosis. Atelectasis usually does not result in much change in acid-base status unless severe.\nEducational objective:\nLoop diuretics are frequently administered to cirrhotic patients with volume overload and ascites. Potential side effects include hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and prerenal renal failure."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "During pregnancy, there exists a high serum concentration of progesterone, which has a direct stimulatory effect on the dorsal respiratory group of the medullary respiratory center. By stimulating this central respiratory center, high progesterone concentrations lead to tachypnea and consequent chronic mild respiratory alkalosis. The progesterone concentration increases with increasing gestational age, thereby explaining why chronic respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation is very common in later pregnancy. In this case, as expected, the patient's arterial blood gas is suggestive of a mild compensated respiratory alkalosis with a pH greater than 7.41, a primary decrease in PaCO2 and a compensatory decrease in HCO3-.\n(Choice A) Anemia in pregnancy is defined as a hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL in the first and third trimesters and less than 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester. If anemia were causing an acid-base disturbance, it would be an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to poor tissue perfusion and lactic acidosis.\n(Choice C) Obesity causes chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation due to hypoventilation.\n(Choice B) A complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is pulmonary embolus (PE), which leads to tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. In this patient, DVT with PE is unlikely because she has a normal physical examination and normal PaO2 level.\n(Choice E) Hyperemesis gravidarum is a complication of early pregnancy (not late pregnancy), and its consequence is hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.\nEducational Objective:\nPregnancy causes a physiological chronic compensated respiratory alkalosis due to the stimulatory effect of progesterone on the medullary respiratory center."

      "D. Decreased anion gap",
      "E. Alveolar diffusion block",
      "F. Hypercarbia"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient's low blood pH (7.15) and low serum bicarbonate (18 mEq/L) indicate a metabolic acidosis. Without being given the chloride concentration and urine electrolytes, we cannot calculate the serum anion gap, but despite this, it is most likely that the acidosis is due to the patient's acute renal failure (ARF). Metabolic acidosis due to ARF results from the kidneys’ failure to excrete acids generated during normal protein metabolism, namely inorganic phosphates and sulfates. The cause of ARF in this patient is most likely ischemia resulting from hypotension during her gastrointestinal bleeding. In normal respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis, the pCO2 decreases as the HCO3 decreases. The expected decrease in pCO2 can be calculated using Winter's formula:\npCO2 = 1.5[HCO3-] + 8\nThus, given her degree of metabolic acidosis, the patient would be expected to hyperventilate until her pCO2 approached 35 mmHg. In this patient, metabolic acidosis is complicated by respiratory acidosis resulting in hypercarbia (pCO2 of 80 mmHg) which is the most likely cause of this patient's confusion.\n(Choice A) Defective tubular bicarbonate reabsorption is the defect seen in type II renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Type II RTA is oftentimes inherited, and may be a component of Fanconi syndrome. Type II RTA can also occur with use of drugs like carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.\n(Choice B) Low tubular ammonium production is a component of type I RTA. The primary defect in type I RTA is failure to secrete sufficient H+ in the urine. Without sufficient hydrogen ions in the tubular fluid, ammonium cannot be produced.\n(Choice C) Renal tubular epithelial cells exchange chloride for bicarbonate. Thus, when the urine chloride is increased, bicarbonate resorption into the plasma is increased and urinary excretion of H+ is increased. In this patient, renal chloride and acid excretion are inadequate relative to her body's rate of acid production.\n(Choice D) Decreased anion gap metabolic acidosis may be caused by plasma cell dyscrasias and other paraproteinemias as well as lithium intoxication. Because this patient's acidosis is most likely due to acute renal insufficiency, her anion gap should be normal or somewhat elevated, not decreased.\n(Choice E) A decrease in alveolar diffusing capacity could cause hypoxia and tachypnea. Tachypnea would cause further lowering of the pCO2 because CO2 is more readily diffusible than O2.\nEducational objective:\nNormally, tachypnea is the mode of respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis, as it allows for increased CO2 losses in exhaled air."

      "DO. Hypochloremia",
      "E. Hypomagnesemia"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has primary adrenal failure, or Addison's disease. The signs and symptoms of chronic adrenal failure are somewhat nonspecific. Anorexia and fatigue occur in close to 100% of patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea or constipation occur in up to 90% of patients. Other signs include weight loss, hyperpigmentation, decreased blood pressure, and vitiligo.\nHyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in adrenal insufficiency, affecting up to 90% of patients. It is the result of volume contraction (due to mineralocorticoid deficiency) and increased vasopressin secretion (due to lack of cortisol suppression). Hyperkalemia is also a common electrolyte abnormality, occurring in up to 65% of affected individuals due to decreased activation of aldosterone receptors. In most cases the hyperkalemia is accompanied by a mild hyperchloremic acidosis.\n(Choice B) As described above, hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia, is a common finding in adrenal insufficiency. Hypokalemia is sometimes seen in patients with Cushing's syndrome.\n(Choice C) Hypernatremia is common in patients with Cushing's syndrome but is rare in adrenal insufficiency. Hyponatremia, on the other hand, is seen in the majority of patients with Addison's disease.\n(Choice D) Adrenal insufficiency is often accompanied by a mild hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, not a decrease in serum chloride concentration.\n(Choice E) Common causes of hypomagnesemia include poor nutrition, malabsorption, diuretic use, and alcohol abuse. Hypomagnesemia is not strongly associated with adrenal insufficiency.\nEducational objective:\nAdrenal insufficiency and adrenal failure are characterized by nonspecific symptoms and signs including anorexia, fatigue, GI complaints, weight loss, and hypotension. Hyponatremia is the most common associated electrolyte abnormality. Hyperkalemia is also common."

      "F. Septic shock"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker often used during rapid-sequence intubation because it has a rapid onset (45-60 seconds) and offset (6-10 minutes) of action. However, it can cause significant potassium release and life-threatening arrhythmias, and so should not be used in patients with or at high risk for hyperkalemia. This includes patients with crush or burn injuries more than 8 hours old (high risk of rhabdomyolysis), patients with demyelinating syndromes like Guillain-Barré, and patients with tumor lysis syndrome. Non-depolarizing agents such as vecuronium or rocuronium are a better choice in these patients.\n(Choice B) A patient with a severe COPD exacerbation who is failing non-invasive ventilation may require rapid-sequence intubation.\n(Choice C) Succinylcholine is not contraindicated in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction, but lower doses should be used.\n(Choice D) Hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia, is a contraindication to using succinylcholine.\n(Choice E) Succinylcholine is not affected by, and has no effects on, the body's calcium concentration.\n(Choice F) Septic shock is often accompanied by respiratory failure requiring intubation. Succinylcholine is frequently used for rapid-sequence intubation in this setting.\nEducational objective:\nSuccinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that can cause life-threatening hyperkalemia. It should not be used in patients with or at high risk for hyperkalemia, such as burn and crush injury patients and patients with prolonged demyelination."

      "C. Calculate the urine anion gap",
      "D. Calculate the urine osmolar gap",
      "E. Obtain venous blood gas"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-). To correctly identify his acid-base status, the best next step is calculation of the anion gap (AG). The AG represents the unmeasured anions in the body. It can be calculated with the following formula:\nAG = Na+ - (HCO3- + Cl-)\nThe normal AG is between 6 and 12 mEq/L. An increase in the AG indicates the presence of non-chloride acids that contain inorganic, organic, exogenous or unidentified anions. Finding an increased anion gap clinically narrows the differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis to a few common causes. Some of the most common causes of anionic gap metabolic acidosis are:\n1. Lactic acidosis: Hypoxia, poor tissue perfusion, mitochondrial dysfunction\n2. Ketoacidosis: Type I diabetes, starvation or alcoholism\n3. Methanol ingestion: Formic acid accumulation\n4. Ethylene glycol ingestion: Glycolic and oxalic acid accumulation\n5. Salicylate poisoning: Causes concomitant respiratory alkalosis\n6. Uremia (ESRD): Failure to excrete H+ as NH4+\n(Choice B) The osmolar gap should be calculated in selected cases of increased anion gap acidosis, such as when ethanol, methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity is suspected. It is calculated by determining the difference between the measured and calculated serum osmolality.\n(Choice C) The urine anion gap is calculated when there is a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. The urine anion gap helps determine if such acidosis is due to the renal or intestinal bicarbonate losses. Renal losses of bicarbonate occur in renal tubular acidosis or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use. Gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate occurs classically in diarrhea.\n(Choice D) Calculation of the urine osmolar gap will not help determine the acid-base status of this patient.\n(Choice E) A venous blood gas should differ little from an arterial blood gas except for the decrease in O2 levels seen in venous blood compared to arterial blood. Venous blood that contains a similar oxygen content as arterial blood may indicate a disorder of respiratory metabolism such as cyanide poisoning.\nEducational Objective:\nThe anion gap must always be calculated in patients with metabolic acidosis in order to narrow the differential diagnosis."

      "D. Metabolic alkalosis",
      "E. Narmal acid base status"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Human blood pH is normally maintained at 7.35-7.45. HCO3- is normally 24 mEq/L, and PaCO2 is normally 40 mm Hg. Any deviation from these normal values is indicative of an acid-base disorder. Metabolic acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in the concentration of HCO3-, whereas respiratory acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in PCO2. A primary rise in PaCO2 (respiratory acidosis) or fall in plasma HCO3- (metabolic acidosis) reduces the pH, whereas a primary fall in PCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) or a rise in plasma HCO3- (metabolic alkalosis) increases the pH. In this case, the patient has a respiratory alkalosis because his pH is greater than 7.45 and he has a primary decrease in his PaCO2. He is suffering from pneumonia, which has caused tachypnea due to hypoxia. Hyperventilation results in CO2 loss and a consequent decrease in PaCO2. Because CO2 is an acid, CO2 loss causes alkalosis. The slightly decreased bicarbonate level is due to early renal compensation.\n(Choice A) Respiratory acidosis is most commonly caused by respiratory suppression. Potential causes include narcotic overdose, neurologic diseases causing airway muscle weakness and COPD.\n(Choice C) Classic causes of metabolic acidosis can be recalled using the mnemonic MUDPILES (anion-gap). Methanol, Uremia (renal failure), DKA, Paraldehyde, INH, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, Salicylates. Diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis are other causes (non-anion gap).\n(Choice D) Metabolic alkalosis is most commonly caused by vomiting. Hyperaldosteronism and volume contraction are other causes.\nEducational Objective:\nRespiratory alkalosis is characterized by an increased pH and a primary decrease in the PaCO2. Typical causes include hyperventilation due to pneumonia, high altitude or salicylate intoxication."

      "C. MNormal saline",
      "DO. Phenabarbital",
      "E. Lorazepam"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient developed symptomatic hyponatremia over 24 hours due to the inappropriate administration of D51/2NS. This medical emergency requires prompt correction of the serum sodium concentration with 3% saline solution.\nHyponatremia causes brain swelling. When hyponatremia develops slowly, cells in the brain compensate by extruding osmolytes (e.g., Na+, K+) and intracellular water, thus reducing the cerebral edema. However, in rapidly developing hyponatremia, as in patients receiving hypoosmolar IV fluids, there is not time for cells to adjust to the lower serum osmolality, and symptoms develop quickly.\nIn patients with chronic hyponatremia, the sodium deficit must be corrected slowly. Increases in the serum sodium concentration by more than 0.5 mEq/L/h in these patients raise the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. In patients with acute hyponatremia, however, the brain has not yet lost volume to accommodate the new serum concentration and, therefore, the correction can happen much more rapidly. Thus, this patient with acute, symptomatic hyponatremia should receive hypertonic saline until his symptoms resolve.\n(Choice A) Fosphenytoin may decrease seizure activity in this patient but will not fix the underlying cause of his seizures.\n(Choice C) Normal saline is an appropriate therapy for patients with mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic hypovolemic hyponatremia. In a patient with severe, acute, symptomatic hyponatremia, however, hypertonic saline will work more quickly.\n(Choice D) Phenobarbital is a third-line agent for the treatment of status epilepticus. It is typically used only after benzodiazepines and phenytoin have failed.\n(Choice E) Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines are the initial treatment of choice for active seizures. If this patient were in status epilepticus, lorazepam administration would be reasonable. However, to address the underlying problem, hypertonic saline must still be given.\nEducational objective:\nAcute, symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring a prompt increase in the serum sodium concentration. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia requires slow correction of the serum sodium concentration because the cells of the brain have adjusted to the hyponatremic milieu and rapid increases in the serum sodium can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome."

      "E. IV free water",
      "F. IV colloid solution"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hypernatremia reflects a water deficit in relation to sodium, and occurs when there is increased hypotonic fluid loss and decreased access to free water. It most often occurs in people who are debilitated or have altered levels of consciousness and cannot access free water.\nInclusion body myositis is a condition involving adult-onset distal muscular weakness and atrophy. Majority of patients may also present with dysphagia. In the above vignette, the patient's medical condition/disability has most likely resulted in poor free water intake, thereby causing severe hypovolemic hypernatremia (mental status changes, severe volume depletion).\nThe initial treatment for severe hypovolemic hypernatremia is isotonic 0.9% saline, which acts to gradually correct the hyperosmolality while normalizing the patient's volume status. Isotonic saline is usually hypoosmolar in comparison to the hypernatremic plasma. Once the volume deficit has been restored, such patients are then switched to half-normal (0.45%) saline in order to better replace the free water deficit. The goal rate of plasma sodium correction is no more than 1 mEq/L/h. A greater rate of correction may result in cerebral edema.\nPatients with less severe hypovolemic hypernatremia are initially treated with 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline.\n(Choice A) Oral free water is reasonable therapy for otherwise well-functioning patients who have been free water depleted (e.g., euvolemic and hypervolemic hypernatremia). Free water will not restore this patient's volume status, and should not be used.\n(Choice C) 5% dextrose in water (D5W) is the treatment of choice for patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hypernatremia.\n(Choice D) 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline is the treatment of choice for mild hypovolemic hypernatremia.\n(Choice E) IV free water may cause red blood cell lysis due to osmotic shock when given to patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hypernatremia; therefore, 5% dextrose should be used instead.\n(Choice F) Colloid solutions are effective in correcting hypovolemia; however, these are not more successful, and are significantly more expensive, than normal saline. For these reasons, colloid solutions are not recommended as the first-line therapy for hypovolemia.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most common cause of hypernatremia is hypovolemia. Mild cases can be treated with 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline. Severe cases should be initially treated with 0.9% saline."

His laboratory values are:\nSerum sodium                139 mEg/L\nSerum potassium           3.1 mEg/lL\nSerum calcium               8.9 mEg/L\nSerum chloride               88 mEg/L\nSerum bicarbonate           33 mEq/L\nBlood glucose                95 maoidL\nBUN                          20 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine            1.1 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most likely cause of the decreased chloride level in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Gastrointestinal loss",
      "B. Bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidney",
      "C. Metabolic alkalosis",
      "D. Intracellular shift",
      "E. Volume depletion",
      "F. Hypokalemia"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The chemistry values obtained for this patient demonstrate hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and an elevated bicarbonate level. These findings are all consistent with gastrointestinal losses due to vomiting (Choice A). Gastrointestinal fluid is rich in both hydrogen chloride and potassium chloride. Therefore, any process by which excessive gastric contents are lost (vomiting, nasogastric suctioning), may result in loss of hydrogen, chloride, and potassium ions. The results include hypochloremia and hypokalemia, as seen in this patient. Furthermore, the loss of hydrogen ions increases the concentration of bicarbonate. An arterial blood gas would be expected to confirm metabolic alkalosis in this patient by demonstrating a pH > 7.4 and in addition to the elevated bicarbonate.\n(Choice B & E) For each hydrogen chloride ion lost due to vomiting, a bicarbonate ion is produced. In addition, the volume contraction caused by vomiting leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin system which stimulates bicarbonate reabsorption. It is important to realize that while volume contraction and bicarbonate reabsorption are increased in this patient, they are the result of hydrogen chloride loss; not the cause of it. These answer choices reverse cause and effect.\n(Choice C) This answer choice again reverses cause and effect. In this patient, vomiting has caused significant loss of hydrogen chloride, resulting in metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis is the consequence—not the cause—of vomiting.\n(Choice D & F) Hypokalemia accompanies, but does not cause this patient's hypochloremia. It is the result of gastrointestinal loss of potassium, the intracellular shift of potassium caused by alkalosis, and increased renal excretion of potassium caused by aldosterone. The aldosterone is ramped up by the renin-angiotensin system as a means to retain fluid.\nEducational objective:\nGastric contents are rich in hydrogen, chloride, and potassium. Therefore vomiting causes hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia. Bicarbonate levels rise as a result of hydrogen loss and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. The administration of isotonic sodium chloride and potassium is used to reverse these electrolyte abnormalities."

      "A. Review all his current medications",
      "B. Measure serum renin and aldosterone levels",
      "C. Obtain electromyography",
      "D. Obtain acetylcholine receptor antibodies",
      "E. Start oral prednisone therapy"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has hyperkalemia (K+ = 5.0 mEq/L). The earliest symptom of hyperkalemia is weakness. Severe hyperkalemia may cause flaccid paralysis, respiratory insufficiency and cardiac toxicity, which may precipitate a sine wave on ECG and ventricular fibrillation. One of the most common causes of hyperkalemia is medications. After addressing the hyperkalemia with a K+ binding resin such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, it is best to obtain a complete medical history and review all of the patient's medications. Commonly used drugs that may precipitate hyperkalemia include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and spironolactone, all of which may cause hyperkalemia by blocking aldosterone synthesis or action. Other medications that may cause hyperkalemia include trimethoprim and pentamidine.\n(Choice B) Renin and aldosterone levels may be measured to rule out adrenal insufficiency, but it is not the best next step in the management of this patient.\n(Choice C and D) There is no reason to check other causes of muscle weakness in this patient as hyperkalemia is the most likely cause.\n(Choice E) Prednisone is helpful for inflammatory myopathies, but this patient's weakness is most likely due to hyperkalemia. Indiscriminate use of prednisone is not indicated due to its various adverse effects including GERD, osteoporosis, diabetogenesis and weight gain among others.\nEducational Objective:\nOne of the most common causes of hyperkalemia is medications such as ACE inhibitors, spironolactone and trimethoprim."

      "E. Head trauma",
      "F. Psychogenic polydipsia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a leading cause of euvolemic hypernatremia. It typically presents with severe polyuria and mild hypernatremia. It can be divided into two types based on urine osmolality, as well as etiology.\nBased on urine osmolality, DI may be complete or partial.\n1. Complete DI - the urine osmolality is less than 300 mOsm/kg (often less than 100 mOsm/kg)\n2. Partial DI - urine osmolality ranges from 300-600 mOsm/kg.\nThe serum osmolality is elevated in both types.\nBased on etiology, DI may be central or nephrogenic.\n1. Central DI is due to decreased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Common causes include trauma, hemorrhage, infection, and tumors.\n2. Nephrogenic DI results from renal ADH resistance. Common causes include hypercalcemia, severe hypokalemia, tubulointerstitial renal disease, and medications. The most commonly implicated medications are lithium, demeclocycline, foscarnet, cidofovir, and amphotericin.\nIn this vignette, the patient's clinical history, presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus most likely caused by lithium, which is one of the first-line drugs for bipolar disorder.\n(Choice A) Dehydration is the hallmark of hypovolemic hypernatremia. Furthermore, patients with this condition have increased urine osmolality.\n(Choice C) Divalproic acid is a mood stabilizer that is also used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and weight gain. It is not associated with DI.\n(Choice D) Craniopharyngiomas are relatively rare tumors of the sella and suprasellar space. These may cause central DI. The typical presentation includes headaches, focal neurologic changes, or visual problems; which this patient does not have.\n(Choice E) Head trauma is another cause of central DI. This is an unlikely cause of the patient's condition, as there is no mention of any head trauma in the history, nor is there any external evidence of trauma on physical examination.\n(Choice F) Psychogenic polydipsia results from excessive free water intake by patients who usually have an associated psychiatric condition. Although DI and psychogenic polydipsia both present with euvolemia and polyuria; patients with the former are hypernatremic, whereas those with the latter are hyponatremic.\nEducational objective:\nLithium is a common cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI is treated with salt restriction and discontinuation of lithium."

    "question": "A 22-year-old female is hospitalized after a car accident. She sustained a hip fracture, fractures of several\nribs and a blunt abdominal injury that required a laparotomy. The laparotomy revealed a liver laceration and\nextensive hemaoperitaneum. In the early postoperative period, the patient is noted to have hyperactive deep\ntendon reflexes. Which of the following electrolyte abnormalities may be respansible for this condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hypokalemia",
      "B. Hyperkalemia",

      "DO. Hypocalcemia",
      "E.Hypermagnesemia"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Hypocalcemia is the most probable diagnosis in this patient. Hypocalcemia can occur during or immediately after surgery in patients requiring multiple blood transfusions. Usually, hypocalcemia results from volume expansion and hypoalbuminemia and is therefore asymptomatic because the ionized calcium is typically normal in that scenario. When the ionized calcium is also decreased (e.g., due to citrate binding), symptoms such as hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, muscle cramps and, rarely, convulsions may occur. Severe hypomagnesemia may mimic hypocalcemia because it causes decreased PTH secretion and decreased peripheral responsiveness to PTH.\n(Choice A) Hypokalemia causes muscle weakness and cramps. Symptoms may progress to flaccid paralysis if hypokalemia is severe. The EKG shows U waves in severe hypokalemia.\n(Choice B) Hyperkalemia typically results in muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, and ECG changes. Asystole may occur with severe hyperkalemia.\n(Choice C) Hyponatremia is typically asymptomatic. Prolonged significant hyponatremia may cause weakness, lethargy, delirium and seizures.\n(Choice E) Mild hypermagnesemia results in decreased deep tendon reflexes. Severe hypermagnesemia causes loss of deep tendon reflexes, muscle paralysis, apnea and cardiac arrest.\nEducational objective:\nHypocalcemia can occur during or immediately after surgery in patients undergoing major surgery and requiring extensive transfusions. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes may be the initial manifestation."

      "C. Acute pancreatitis",
      "D. Acute appendicitis",
      "E. Peptic ulcer perforation"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has an anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is supported by his decreased bicarbonate concentration and his increased anion gap (140-(103+14) = 23, NL = 6 – 12 mEq/L). His past medical history is significant for severe atherosclerotic disease and atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation. Given this history and the patient's clinical presentation with acute abdominal pain and nausea accompanied by hypoactive bowel sounds and abdominal tenderness on physical examination, bowel ischemia is the most likely diagnosis. Bowel ischemia is a common cause of lactic acidosis in patients with atherosclerotic disease and atrial fibrillation. Lactic acidosis in this scenario results from the production of lactate as an end product of anaerobic metabolism in the ischemic tissue. The accumulation of lactate in the serum accounts for the anion gap.\n(Choice A) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can cause anion gap acidosis and present with acute nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain and tenderness. The patient's glucose is not consistent with DKA which usually occurs in the setting of glucose levels in the range of 250 to 600 mg/dL. DKA can, however, rarely occur with lower glucose levels. Additionally, DKA is uncommon in type 2 diabetics who usually experience hyperosmolar coma with severe hyperglycemia.\n(Choice C) The upper limit of normal for amylase is 65 U/L. Elevations in the serum amylase may indicate pancreatitis, but a false positive amylase can be seen with many conditions. The patient is not an alcoholic and has had a cholecystectomy, so pancreatitis is unlikely. In this case, bowel necrosis is most likely causing the drastic increase in the serum amylase.\n(Choices D and E) Acute appendicitis and peptic ulcer perforation usually do not cause severe acidosis unless the patient becomes hypotensive.\nEducational Objective:\nUnrecognized bowel ischemia is one of the common causes of lactic acidosis in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease or atrial fibrillation."

      "OD. Blocking alphal-adrenoreceptars",
      "E. Blocking betal-adrenareceptors"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has hyperkalemia with significant EKG changes (QRS prolongation with peaked T waves). Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, but can cause muscle weakness. Flaccid paralysis can develop in severe cases. Severe hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias, and therefore requires urgent treatment.\nTherapy includes emergent administration of IV calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane. The next step is to lower serum potassium by driving potassium intracellularly. Finally, the excess potassium should be eliminated it from the body. Agents used to shift potassium intracellularly include insulin and glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and beta-2 agonists. Albuterol, a selective beta-2 agonist, is widely used for this purpose. Therefore, stimulating beta-2-adrenoreceptors (Choice C) is the correct answer.\nThis patient's hyperkalemia is most likely the result of chronic renal insufficiency and enalapril.\n(Choice A) Alpha-1 agonists, like phenylephrine, cause vasoconstriction with minimal effects on heart rate or contractility. They have no role in the treatment of hyperkalemia.\n(Choice B) Beta-1 agonists have chronotropic and inotropic effects, and are not used in treating hyperkalemia.\n(Choice D) Alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists cause peripheral vasodilation, and are used in the treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, not hyperkalemia.\n(Choice E) Beta-1 blockers are commonly used in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. They are not indicated in the treatment of hyperkalemia.\nEducational objective:\nAgents used to shift potassium intracellularly include insulin and glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and beta-2 agonists."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His lab values indicate hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis given his primary decrease in bicarbonate and his anion gap of 8 (NL = 6 – 12). Renal insufficiency accompanied by hyperkalemia and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is consistent with type 4 renal tubular acidosis. Type 4 RTA is caused by aldosterone deficiency or renal tubular insensitivity to aldosterone. The lack of aldosterone effect in these patients leads to a failure to secrete acid as NH4+ and retention of potassium. Type 4 RTA may occur in the setting of diabetic nephropathy due to type I or II DM, and the condition can be worsened by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as ACE-Is and ARBs.\n(Choice A) Chronic renal failure is a common cause of hypochloremic (anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to failure to excrete acid as NH4+ and accumulation of organic anions.\n(Choice C) Furosemide is a loop diuretic that may cause hypovolemia leading to contraction alkalosis. Contraction alkalosis is a metabolic alkalosis; laboratory tests would show a primary increase in bicarbonate.\n(Choice D) Glipizide is a sulfonylurea-class oral hypoglycemic. The most common adverse effect associated with these agents is hypoglycemia. They may rarely cause hyponatremia, but are not associated with acid-base disturbances.\n(Choice E) Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. It most commonly causes gastroesophageal reflux, headache and peripheral edema. The CCBs are not associated with acid-base disturbances.\nEducational objective:\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis should be suspected in a diabetic patient with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, persistent hyperkalemia, and renal insufficiency."

High PaCO2 and low PaO2 levels are suggestive of alveolar hypoventilation, though an elevated PaCO2 alone, in the range of 50 to 80 mmHg, is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Causes of alveolar hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis include the following:\nPulmonary / thoracic diseases: COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, cystic fibrosis, obesity (Pickwickian), scoliosis, ankylosis\nNeuromuscular diseases: myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton, poliomyelitis, muscular dystrophies, Guillain-Barre, ALS\nDrug-induced hypoventilation: anesthetics, narcotics, sedatives\nPrimary CNS dysfunction: brainstem lesion, infection, stroke\n(Choices B, C, D and E) Acute pulmonary embolism, atelectasis, pulmonary edema and pleural effusion can cause a decrease in PaO2 (hypoxemia), but these conditions typically also cause a decrease in PaCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) due to concomitant tachypnea.\nEducational Objective:\nRespiratory acidosis is characterized by a decreased pH and a primary increase in the PaCO2.

      "C. Increased ADH production",
      "D. Drug-induced water retention",
      "E. Deficient ADH secretion"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This woman's altered mental status and seizures are most likely the result of hyponatremia secondary to primary polydipsia. Primary polydipsia is relatively common among patients with schizophrenia. Because patients with primary polydipsia have normally functioning kidneys, they excrete dilute urine (low specific gravity, <=1.003) as their bodies attempt to regain osmotic balance. Primary polydipsia is the only answer choice above that would cause both hyponatremia and maximally dilute urine. Simultaneous administration of phenothiazines to schizophrenic patients with primary polydipsia can worsen the hyponatremia because dry mouth is a side effect that further stimulates thirst.\n(Choice B) Lithium-induced ADH resistance causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients cannot retain water appropriately, and thus develop hypernatremia in the setting of maximally dilute urine.\n(Choice C) SIADH causes inappropriate retention of free water, leading to hyponatremia in the setting of inappropriately concentrated urine.\n(Choice D) Carbamazepine intensifies the kidneys’ response to ADH, causing water retention, hyponatremia, and inappropriately concentrated urine, as in SIADH.\n(Choice E) In central diabetes insipidus (DI), insufficient hypothalamic ADH release causes excessive renal water excretion, hypernatremia, and dilute urine. Exogenous ADH administration can distinguish central from nephrogenic DI. Central DI corrects with exogenously administered ADH, nephrogenic DI does not.\nEducational objective:\nPrimary polydipsia is a problem of excessive water ingestion. The kidneys continue to work appropriately, excreting dilute urine. The diagnosis of primary polydipsia is confirmed by withholding water from the patient, and monitoring the urine. Increases in urine osmolality and specific gravity confirm the diagnosis."

      "DO. Mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis",
      "E. NMarmal acid-base balance"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described has a mixed acid-base disorder resulting from a combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis. The low pH (7.23 < 7.35) indicates acidosis, the decreased HCO3- (16 mEq/L < 24 mEq/L) indicated a primary metabolic acidosis and the inappropriately normal PaCO2 (40 mmHg) indicates a primary respiratory acidosis. To prove that the PaCO2 is inappropriately normal, Winter's formula can be used to calculate what the PaCO2 ought to be in order to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. Winter's formula is as follows:\nPaCO2 = 1.5(HCO3-) + 8\nIn this patient, appropriate respiratory compensation would result in a PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, which is lower than his actual PaCO2 of 40 mmHg. This indicates that the patient's PaCO2 is elevated relative to what it ought to be given the metabolic acidosis.\nEducational objective:\nMixed acid-base disorders may cause inappropriately normal laboratory values. Calculate the expected change in the PaCO2 or HCO3- and compare that to the patient's measured values to determine if a mixed disorder exists or if normal physiologic compensation has occurred."

      "C. Intravenous 3% saline",
      "DO. Intravenous 0.9% saline",
      "E. Intravenous dopamine"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Based on the information provided, the patient described is suffering from a postoperative pneumonia that is developing into septic shock (acidosis, low urine output, hypotension, tachypnea, fever). His ABG is suggestive of metabolic acidosis (decreased pH, primary decrease in bicarbonate level), which has likely resulted from the accumulation of lactate in the blood secondary to tissue hypoxia and anaerobic respiration resulting from hypotension related to septic shock. The treatment of septic shock is correction of the underlying cause and restoration of tissue perfusion. IV normal saline is the first-line treatment for maintenance of intravascular pressure while antibiotics are given to correct the underlying infection.\n(Choice A) The use of bicarbonate in the treatment of lactic acidosis is controversial and is recommended only in severe acute acidosis (pH <= 7.2).\n(Choice B) Dextrose solutions are not as widely accepted as normal saline for the maintenance of blood pressure.\n(Choice C) Hypertonic saline is used occasionally to rapidly expand the intravascular volume by drawing fluid out of the extravascular compartment.\n(Choice E) Vasopressors are indicated for the treatment of hypotension in states of shock only after intravenous fluids have failed to restore normotension.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most important steps in the management of lactic acidosis from septic shock are IV normal saline with or without vasopressor therapy to maintain the intravascular pressure and antibiotics to correct the underlying infection."

      "A. Primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation",
      "B. Primary metabolic acidosis without compensation",
      "C. Respiratory acidosis with compensation",
      "D. Primary metabolic alkalosis with renal compensation",
      "E. Normal acid base status"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This vignette describes the classic presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which usually occurs in type 1 diabetics. He probably has not been taking his insulin due to severe depression. Typical symptoms of DKA include polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain that may mimic a surgical abdomen. The patient's ABG indicates that a metabolic acidosis (pH below 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-, compensatory decrease in PCO2) with an increased anion gap [AG = 132-(85+14) = 33]. Due to the accumulation of ketoacids in the blood, DKA is by definition an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Winter's formula can be used to calculate the expected PCO2 during respiratory compensation for a primary metabolic acidosis. Winter's formula is as follows:\nPaCO2 = 1.5(HCO3-) + 8\nUsing the patient's values, the expected PaCO2 is 29. In this patient, the measured PCO2 is within the range of the expected PCO2 in his ABG. This indicates complete respiratory compensation of his metabolic acidosis. Clinically, respiratory compensation of DKA occurs via deep and rapid breathing (Kussmaul breathing).\n(Choice B) Primary metabolic acidosis without compensation would cause a decreased pH, a primarily decreased HCO3-, and no change in the PCO2.\n(Choice C) Respiratory acidosis with compensation would cause a decreased pH, a primarily increased PCO2, and a secondarily increased HCO3-.\n(Choice D) Primary metabolic alkalosis with renal compensation occurs physiologically as follows. The primary metabolic alkalosis causes an abnormal accumulation of HCO3-. As a result, the filtered load of HCO3- into the renal tubules is increased beyond the capability of the kidneys to reabsorb it. Thus, in metabolic alkalosis, renal HCO3- losses automatically increase. The patient's ABG indicates a metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis.\n(Choice E) Normal acid base status is pH 7.35 to 7.45, HCO3- of 22 – 26 mEq/L, and PCO2 of 35 – 45 mm Hg.\nEducational Objective:\nDiabetic ketoacidosis causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Typical symptoms of DKA include polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain that may mimic a surgical abdomen."

    "options": [
      "A. Mormal phenomenan of pregnancy",
      "B. Pulmonary embolism",
      "C. Obesity",
      "D. Aspiration pneumanitis",
      "E. Hyperemesis gravidarum"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. This can be determined by her ABG results showing a pH greater than 7.45, a primary increase in HCO3- level and a compensatory increase in PaCO2. The increase in PaCO2 does not indicate a mixed primary acid-base disturbance because the compensatory increase in PaCO2 expected given the metabolic acidosis is approximately 52 – 53 mm Hg. Vomiting, such as in hyperemesis gravidarum, leads to loss of gastric HCl and metabolic alkalosis. This is known as the generation stage of metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting. The volume loss that results from repeated vomiting also causes a contraction metabolic alkalosis due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This is known as the maintenance phase.\n(Choice A) Hypocapnia is a normal phenomenon of late pregnancy and would cause a respiratory alkalosis. It is caused by a direct stimulatory effect of progesterone on the central respiratory center.\n(Choice B) This patient may have a deep vein thrombosis (swollen leg), but a pulmonary embolus (PE) is unlikely. PE causes a primary respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation.\n(Choice C) Obesity can cause hypoventilation (Pickwickian syndrome) leading to chronic respiratory acidosis. While the patient's BMI is at the lower limit of obesity, she is also pregnant. Additionally, she is not experiencing a primary respiratory acidosis.\n(Choice D) Aspiration pneumonia leads to hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis secondary to tachypnea.\nEducational Objective:\nHyperemesis gravidarum typically causes metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation via hypercapnia."

      "C. Hypernatremia",
      "DO. Hyperkalemia",
      "E. Hypocalcemia"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Major causes of altered mental status in elderly patients include electrolyte disturbances, stroke, cardiac events and infection. The elderly are at an increased risk of dehydration due to decreased ability to access free water and impaired thirst. The patient described in the question exhibits signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and a soft blood pressure with a somewhat rapid pulse. Hypernatremia may result from loss of free water or excessive sodium intake. Decreased access to free water causes hypernatremia due to obligate urinary water losses in the face of maximal renal sodium reabsorption in an effort to correct volume contraction.\n(Choice A) Hyponatremia can result from multiple etiologies causing free water excess or sodium wasting. SIADH may cause hyponatremia in patients following stroke, but such patients are usually euvolemic. Diuretics may also cause hyponatremia in elderly patients.\n(Choice B) Hypokalemia causes muscle weakness and abdominal complaints; it does not typically cause mental status changes.\n(Choice D) Hyperkalemia does not cause mental status changes; it is associated with muscle weakness and EKG changes (cardiac arrhythmias).\n(Choice E) Hypocalcemia can cause mental status changes, but in most cases of dehydration the calcium level is elevated due to hemoconcentration.\nEducational Objective:\nDecreased free water intake will cause hypernatremia due to obligate renal free water losses and sodium reabsorption by the kidney. This is particularly common in elderly demented patients."

      "C. Methyl alcohol poisoning",
      "D. Uremic acidosis",
      "E. Lactic acidosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient has a metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-) with an increased anion gap (Normal = 6 – 12, Patient's AG = 28). All of the given choices can cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis. When the anion gap is markedly elevated and frank uremia is not present, the osmolar gap should be calculated to assess for ethanol, methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication.\nFirst, the serum osmolality is calculated using the following formula:\nSerum osmolality = [2Na + Glu/18 + BUN/2.8]\nIn this patient, the calculated osmolality is 297. The osmolar gap is then calculated using the formula:\nOsmolar gap = observed osmolarity - calculated osmolarity\nIn this patient, the osmolar gap is 53 (normal < 10). The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap and a high osmolar gap. Osmolar gap metabolic acidosis is seen with acute methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. The patient's urine shows rectangular, envelope-shaped crystals consistent with calcium oxalate crystals, which are classically observed in patients with ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol poisoning most commonly follows antifreeze ingestion. Serious sequelae following ethylene glycol ingestion include acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure and renal failure.\n(Choice A) Aspirin (salicylate) toxicity causes a mixed anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with no osmolar gap.\n(Choice C) Methyl alcohol poisoning can cause visual changes (\"snowfield vision\") and acute pancreatitis, but will not cause urine crystals and renal failure.\n(Choice D) Uremia (renal failure) causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to failure to excrete acids as NH4+.\n(Choice E) Lactic acidosis can result from numerous causes including poor delivery of oxygen to the tissues and poor oxygen utilization by the tissues. The result is an anion gap metabolic acidosis.\nEducational Objective:\nCalcium oxalate crystals (rectangular, envelope-shaped crystals) are seen in patients with ethylene glycol (anti-freeze) poisoning. Ethylene glycol, methanol and ethanol intoxication cause metabolic acidosis with both an anion gap and an osmolar gap."

      "D. Urinary pH and PaCO2",
      "E. Urinary pH and HCO3-"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The major extracellular buffer in human blood is the carbon dioxide – bicarbonate buffer pair, which has a pk of 6.1. Acid-base disturbances in patients can be diagnosed by assessing the pH and the changes in either the serum bicarbonate concentration or the serum partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Classically, the acid-base status of a buffer can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with its three variables, pH, [acid] and [conjugate base], as follows:\npH = pK + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\nIn the case of the carbon dioxide – bicarbonate buffer pair, where CO2 is the acid and HCO3- is the conjugate base, the equation is as follows:\npH = 6.1 + log ([HCO3-] / (0.03 x PaCO2))\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, any of the three variables can be calculated if the other two are given. Thus, with respect to the above question, if the pH and PaCO2 are given (Choice A), the HCO3- can be calculated, and with these three data points the acid-base status of the patient can be determined.\n(Choices B, C, D and E) The PO2 gives information about a patient's oxygenation status. The urinary pH, which can vary widely between 4.5 and 8, can give information about renal handling of acids and bases, but it cannot be used to determine a patient's serum acid-base status with the same clarity that pH, HCO3- and PaCO2 can.\nEducational objective:\nIn any patient, the pH and PaCO2 are the two lab values that provide the best picture of acid-base status; the HCO3- can be calculated from these values using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation."

      "D. 740,40 24",
      "E. 745 30,20"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has tinnitus, fever, tachypnea, nausea and vomiting after an overdose of one of her medications. This clinical scenario is highly suggestive of aspirin (salicylate) intoxication. Acute aspirin toxicity stimulates the central respiratory center and leads to respiratory alkalosis by causing tachypnea. Aspirin concurrently causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis by a threefold mechanism. First, salicylate toxicity causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation thereby increasing the rate of oxygen consumption in the peripheral tissues. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is also the cause of the hyperpyrexia seen in aspirin toxicity. Next, salicylate toxicity inhibits enzymes involved with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism leading to accumulation of organic acids such as pyruvate, lactic, and acetoacetic acid. Finally, salicylates impair renal function causing accumulation of inorganic acids such as sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Salicylate toxicity may thus present with a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a near-normal pH, a primary decrease in PaCO2, and a concurrent primary decrease in HCO3-.\nIt is important to stress that the abovementioned case is not a primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation (pH less than 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-, compensatory decrease in PaCO2). Winter's formula can be used to calculate the expected compensatory PaCO2 value in primary metabolic acidoses. Using this formula, the expected PaCO2 value is 26 (PaCO2 = 1.5[HCO3-] + 8). The observed PaCO2 is less than the expected value, thus indicating a coexisting primary respiratory alkalosis.\n(Choice B) Acute respiratory acidosis without compensation is characterized by a pH less than 7.35, primary increase in PaCO2, and normal HCO3-.\n(Choice C) Primary metabolic acidosis without compensation is characterized by a pH less than 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-, and a near normal PaCO2.\n(Choice D) Normal acid-base status is characterized by a pH ranging from 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 ranging from 35-45, and HCO3- of 24.\n(Choice E) Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation is characterized by a pH greater than 7.45, primary decrease in PaCO2, and compensatory decrease in HCO3-.\nEducational objective:\nSuspect aspirin intoxication in a patient with the triad of fever, tinnitus and tachypnea. Adults with aspirin toxicity develop a mixed respiratory alkalosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis."

    "question": "A 40-year-old female presents to your office complaining of the pain in her right hip. She denies trauma and says that the pain began two weeks ago and gradually increased. Her past medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed seven years ago. Her current medications include prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and lansoprazole. There is no local tenderness on physical examination and the range of motion of the right hip is normal. Hip radiograph is normal. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Joint aspiration",
      "B. Low-dose NSAIDs",
      "C. Increase the dose of prednisone",
      "D. MRI of the hip",
      "E. Observation"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The most probable cause of this patient's complaints is avascular necrosis of the femoral head. It represents an ischemic necrosis of the bone with eventual collapse of the periarticular bone and cartilage. Ischemic bone necrosis is due to compromised blood flow to the femoral head that can be traumatic or non-traumatic. The well-known causes of non-traumatic avascular (aseptic) necrosis are chronic corticosteroid therapy, alcoholism, and hemoglobinopathies. The clinical scenario described is typical (progressive hip pain without restriction of motion range and normal radiograph on early stages). A high index of suspicion is required, because early diagnosis is desirable whether nonoperative or operative treatment is considered (Choice E is incorrect); therefore, knowing the predisposing factors is important. MRI and scintigraphy are used to confirm the diagnosis (Choice D).\n(Choice A) Joint aspiration is not used to diagnose this condition. It is indicated if septic arthritis is suspected. This patient does not have restriction of range of motion, fever, chills, and erythema over the joint, which makes septic arthritis very unlikely.\n(Choice C) Increasing the dose of prednisone is inappropriate, because corticosteroids are the cause of the disease.\n(Choice B) NSAIDs may offer symptomatic relief, but arriving to the correct diagnosis is important."

      "E. Celiac disease",
      "F. Intestinal lymphoma",
      "G. HIV Infection"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering from Whipple disease. Whipple's disease is a multisystem disease that is characterized by a multitude of possible manifestations. Most commonly, patients with Whipple disease present with a history of chronic malabsorptive diarrhea (steatorrhea, flatulence, abdominal distention), protein-losing enteropathy, weight loss, migratory non-deforming arthritis, lymphadenopathy and a low-grade fever. The disease may also cause damage to the eye, CNS and myocardium. Whipple's disease is caused by infection with the gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whippeli, but a mechanism whereby patients contract this infection has yet to be determined. The diagnosis is made with a small intestinal biopsy and PCR in patients with clinical symptoms consistent with the disease. Small intestinal biopsy shows PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria containing non-acid-fast gram-positive bacilli.\n(Choice A) Reactive arthritis classically occurs following an infection. The classic example is Reiter syndrome, an HLA-B27-associated reactive arthropathy characterized by conjunctivitis, urethritis and arthritis. It typically follows infections by Chlamydia, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter and C. difficile.\n(Choice B) In sarcoidosis biopsy shows non-caseating granulomas.\n(Choice C) On histopathology, ulcerative colitis shows acute and chronic inflammation of the mucosa leading to crypt abscess formation. Crohn disease shows full-thickness inflammation with granuloma and lymphoid aggregate formation and skip regions.\n(Choice E) Celiac disease (celiac sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is an autoimmune disease characterized by malabsorptive diarrhea. Serologic testing shows anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies, and histopathology shows effacement of small intestinal villi.\n(Choice F) Intestinal lymphoma usually presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, distention, and occult blood in the stool. Malabsorption is not a typical feature, and histopathology would show a diffuse infiltrate by atypical lymphocytes.\n(Choice G) HIV Infection may be associated with a similar syndrome of fever, malabsorptive diarrhea and weight loss when Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infects the small intestinal wall. This would also cause PAS-positive macrophages on small intestinal biopsy, but these bacilli would also be acid-fast."

She had an episode of chills this morning. Her blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, temperature is 38.7C (102F) and respiratory rate is 18/min. Physical examination reveals swelling in the joints of her hand and wrist. The right knee is red and swollen; active and passive range of motion at the right knee is limited due to pain. This patient's current condition can be best treated with which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Colchicine",
      "B. Corticosteroids",
      "C. Anti-cytokine agents",
      "D. Antibiotics",
      "E. Antimetabolites",
      "F. Allopurinol"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's chronic stiffness and pain, as well as the swelling of her wrists and hands, can be explained by her history of rheumatoid arthritis. More concerning, however, is her acute right knee pain, which has been severe enough to interfere with sleep. The two most common explanations for inflammatory monoarthritis (a single red, swollen, painful joint) are septic arthritis and crystal-induced arthritis. Given its potential for joint destruction, septic arthritis should be considered the cause of inflammatory monoarthritis until proven otherwise. This patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis predisposes her to development of septic arthritis, and her fever also increases suspicion for infectious arthritis. Synovial fluid analysis, gram stain and culture are critical for distinguishing septic from crystal-induced arthritis. Treatment of septic arthritis requires prompt administration of IV antibiotics and adequate joint drainage to lessen the likelihood of joint destruction.\n(Choice A) Colchicine is useful in the acute management of gouty arthritis. Although gouty arthritis should be in the differential for this patient pending synovial fluid analysis, her history is more suggestive of septic arthritis.\n(Choice B) Corticosteroids may be used in the management of rheumatoid arthritis as well as crystal-induced arthritis. Corticosteroids would be contraindicated in septic arthritis due to their immunosuppressive action.\n(Choice C) Anti-cytokine agents such as infliximab and etanercept act by interfering with the activity of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and are useful in management of rheumatoid arthritis. Use of these biologic agents is contraindicated during active infections.\n(Choice E) Antimetabolites such as methotrexate have utility in the management of autoimmune diseases. This patient's most pressing condition is septic arthritis; management of her rheumatoid arthritis is currently a lesser priority.\n(Choice F) Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase thereby decreasing uric acid production. It is used for prevention of recurrent gout attacks."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described has signs and symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism. Patients with hypothyroidism will typically present complaining of weakness, cold intolerance, constipation, depression, menorrhagia, hoarseness, dry skin and fine or brittle hair. Exam will reveal bradycardia, delayed deep tendon reflexes and weight gain. Untreated progression of the disease can lead to generalized myxedema, myxedema psychosis and myxedema coma. Generalized myxedema results from the widespread deposition of acid mucopolysaccharides in various tissues including the skin, heart and nerves. Deposition of mucopolysaccharides (matrix substances, mucin) within both the perineurium of the median nerve as well as the tendons passing through the carpal tunnel can compress the median nerve resulting in the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as described in this patient.\n(Choice A) Amyloid fibril deposition within the carpal tunnel causing CTS occurs in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis as well as patients with secondary forms of amyloidosis. The most commonly occurring CTS due to amyloid deposition occurs in the setting of end-stage renal disease or chronic hemodialysis due to deposition of beta 2 microglobulin.\n(Choice B) Tenosynovial inflammation may cause CTS in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis.\n(Choice D) Synovial tendon hyperplasia may cause median nerve compression in patients with acromegaly.\n(Choice E) Accumulation of fluid in carpal tunnel can cause CTS in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester."

Percussion over the lumbar vertebrae does not elicit tenderness. Knee reflexes are symmetric and he has 5/5 strength in the extremities bilaterally. A straight leg raise test is negative. Which of the following is the best test for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Electromyography",
      "B. HLA genotyping",
      "C. Urethral cultures",
      "D. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)",
      "E. Abdominal ultrasonography",
      "F. Serum PTH level"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has symptoms concerning for primary bone cancer or metastasis to the bone. Symptoms that would raise a red flag for cancer include pain not relieved by rest, pain at night, constant or dull pain, fevers, lack of exacerbation with movement, and presence of neurologic changes. Cancer pain is often not tender to palpation. The most common cancers that metastasize to the bone are lung, breast, prostate, renal, and thyroid. Of these possibilities, prostate cancer is most likely in a 61-year-old man, so obtaining a PSA would be a reasonable next step.\n(Choice A) Electromyography (EMG) can be helpful in distinguishing between nerve and muscle disease. This patient does not have findings suggestive of either of these, so an EMG is unlikely to aid in diagnosis.\n(Choice B) Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by progressive limitation of back motion and chest expansion. It most often occurs in young men (<=40 years old). Symptoms, which include back pain and stiffness, are typically worst in the morning and improve as the day progresses. X-rays will show changes characteristic of sacroiliitis. This patient's presentation is not consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.\n(Choice C) This patient does not have fever or urinary symptoms to suggest a urethral infection.\n(Choice E) Abdominal ultrasonography is helpful to evaluate for hydronephrosis and bladder distention. Bladder distention is more likely to cause suprapubic rather than back pain.\n(Choice F) Patients with prostate cancer can develop hypercalcemia. When this occurs, PTH levels will be suppressed. However, not all prostate cancer patients will have sufficient hypercalcemia to suppress PTH, so this is not a reliable diagnostic test."

    "question": "A 51-year-old man complains of difficulty walking and mild right-sided foot pain for the past several weeks. His medical history is significant for type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Physical examination reveals a significantly deformed right foot and a mildly deformed left foot. X-rays suggest effusions in several of the tarsometatarsal joints, large osteophytes, and several extraarticular bone fragments. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's complaints?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hyperuricemia",
      "B. Poor vascular supply",
      "C. Nerve damage",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Bone demineralization",
      "F. Bacterial infection"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has neurogenic arthropathy, also known as Charcot's joint, due to diabetic neuropathy. The process of developing neurogenic arthropathy starts with decreased pain, proprioception, and temperature perception, which can occur due to diabetes, peripheral nerve damage, syringomyelia, spinal cord injury, B12 deficiency, or tabes dorsalis. As normal neurologic input is lost, patients unknowingly traumatize their weight bearing joints. This causes secondary degenerative joint disease, joint deformation, and functional limitation. X-rays will reveal loss of cartilage, osteophyte development, and loose bodies. Associated pain is typically mild. Management of a Charcot's joint involves treating the underlying disease and providing mechanical devices (e.g., special shoes) to assist in weight bearing and to decrease further trauma.\n(Choice A) Gout results from uric acid deposition within joints. It is exquisitely painful and most commonly affects the great toes, ankles, wrists, and elbows. X-rays of joints affected by chronic gout reveal punched-out erosions with an overhanging rim of cortical bone known as a \"rat bite\" lesion.\n(Choice B) Avascular necrosis refers to bone destruction due to poor vascular supply. It is a complication of corticosteroid use, trauma, lupus, sickle cell disease, and a number of other processes. It most commonly affects the proximal and distal femur. Pain is the main symptom.\n(Choice D) Rheumatoid arthritis is a common cause of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis. It typically affects the hands, wrists, feet and ankles. X-rays of patients with long-standing, poorly controlled disease will reveal periarticular osteoporosis, joint erosions, and joint space narrowing.\n(Choice E) Bone demineralization is the hallmark of osteoporosis. This disease predisposes patients to pathologic fractures, particularly of the hip and vertebrae, but does not itself cause joint destruction.\n(Choice F) Bacterial infection is an important cause of acute monoarticular arthritis. It is exquisitely painful and rapidly destructive. An x-ray will reveal joint destruction but not osteophytes or loose bodies. A septic joint is diagnosed by joint fluid aspiration."

    "question": "A 33-year-old tennis player comes to you with a complaint of pain in his right shoulder. He says that the pain is absent at rest but present when he lifts his arm over his head. The pain is compromising his play. On examination, active motion at right shoulder is limited due to pain. Pain is most severe on passive internal rotation and flexion at the right shoulder. No atrophy of the shoulder muscle is seen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Tear of long head of bicep tendon",
      "B. Tennis elbow",
      "C. Subacromial bursitis",
      "D. Anterior dislocation of shoulder",
      "E. Axillary nerve palsy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described is suffering from subacromial bursitis. The subacromial bursa lies between the acromion and the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle. Inflammation of the subacromial bursa typically occurs in the setting of chronic microtrauma to the supraspinatus tendon caused by overhead work and repeated overhead movements of the arm during work or sporting activities. The tendon is traumatized by compression between the acromion and the humeral head, and its vascular supply may be temporarily compromised during such episodes of compression. The physical examination in subacromial bursitis reveals pain with active range of motion of the shoulder, tenderness in the shoulder when the arm is internally rotated and forward flexed at the shoulder (Neer impingement sign) and no signs of deltoid atrophy.\n(Choices A & D) A tear of the proximal end of the long head of bicep tendon is associated with rotator cuff injury and typically occurs during forceful flexion of the arm. Patients present with a prominent bulge in the midportion of the upper arm. Axillary nerve injury may occur as a result of anterior dislocation of the humerus out of the glenoid fossa.\n(Choice B) Tennis elbow causes chronic nagging pain over the lateral epicondyle (lateral epicondylitis).\n(Choice E) The axillary nerve supplies the deltoid and the teres minor with motor innervation. Palsy of this nerve would result in paralysis and ultimately denervation atrophy of these muscles."

      "E. Low Ca, High Phos, Normal Alk Phos, Normal Urinary Hydroxyproline"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering from osteitis deformans (Paget disease of bone). Paget disease is a disorder of accelerated and disordered osteoclastic bone resorption of uncertain etiology. Increased bone resorption in this disease is answered by disorganized formation of lamellar or woven bone in affected sites that is inherently weaker than normally formed bone. The most commonly involved sited are the femur, axial skeleton and skull. Involvement of the weight-bearing bones of the lower extremities causes pain and bowing of the bone. Hypertrophy of the skull can compress the vestibulocochlear nerve as it passes through the internal acoustic meatus resulting in deafness. Laboratory abnormalities seen in Paget disease of bone include normal calcium and phosphate levels and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. Urinary markers of bone degradation such as hydroxyproline, deoxypyridinoline, N-telopeptide and C-telopeptide are elevated as well.\n(Choice C) Hyperparathyroidism is associated with hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia and an increased alkaline phosphatase.\n(Choice D) Hypercalcemia in the setting of normal phosphate and alkaline phosphatase levels may be observed in the milk-alkali syndrome."

She has no medical problems and does not take any medications. She does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure is 150/100 mmHg and pulse is 78/min. Examination shows erythema over the cheeks and nose. Labs reveal a serum creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL and her urinalysis shows 2+ protein and 20 RBC/HPF.

      "D. Cyclophosphamide",
      "E. Cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This young woman's presentation is consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Women in their 20's and 30's are at highest risk for developing this multisystem autoimmune disease. Common signs and symptoms of SLE include malar \"butterfly\" rash, arthritis, painless oral ulcers, and renal disease—all of which are demonstrated by this patient. In addition to this patient's constellation of clinical signs and symptoms, a positive anti-DS DNA is highly specific (75-100%) for SLE. One of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in SLE is renal disease, occurring in 40-75% of patients. The spectrum of lupus-induced renal disease is broad, ranging from mild elevations in serum creatinine to rapidly progressive renal failure. Similarly, the pathologic type of lupus nephritis ranges from class I (minimal mesangial) to class VI (advanced sclerosis). Renal biopsy is essential in patients with lupus nephritis because different forms of nephritis have different treatments. Furthermore, an initial biopsy provides a baseline histology against which future biopsies may be compared to monitor disease progression. Delay in renal biopsy may adversely affect outcome.\nMethotrexate (Choice B), methylprednisolone (Choice C), and cyclophosphamide (Choices D & E) are immunosuppressants used to treat SLE with severe organ involvement. The extent of this patient's organ involvement is not yet determined."

      "B. Low dose prednisone",
      "C. Methotrexate therapy",
      "D. MRI of the brain with contrast",
      "E. High dose acetazolamide",
      "F. High dose prednisone"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is highly suggestive of temporal, or giant cell, arteritis. Temporal arteritis should be suspected in any patient over 50 years of age with a new headache, jaw claudication, scalp pain, visual loss or symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. Temporal arteritis is a form of large vessel vasculitis that affects the aorta and its cranial arterial branches. Once temporal arteritis is strongly suspected on clinical grounds, immediate empiric treatment with high dose steroids is paramount. Visual loss is one of the most feared complications of temporal arteritis, affecting up to 20% of patients. Prompt systemic steroid administration significantly lowers the rate of visual complications and decreases the likelihood of visual loss in this patient's unaffected eye. The ESR will be elevated in this patient and temporal artery biopsy will provide definitive diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Temporal artery biopsy is indicated to confirm diagnosis of temporal arteritis in this patient. However, biopsy is non-emergent and empiric treatment with high dose steroids takes priority in clinically suspected temporal arteritis.\n(Choice B) Low dose steroids may be used to treat patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. This condition presents with stiffness and pain of the shoulders and pelvic girdle. These patients are at increased risk of developing temporal arteritis and should be screened for this disease.\n(Choice C) Methotrexate is less effective than high dose steroids in treating temporal arteritis and should not be used.\n(Choice D) MRI of the brain with contrast does carry some diagnostic and prognostic value in temporal arteritis. However, empiric treatment takes precedence in this patient and temporal artery biopsy remains the definitive method for diagnosis.\n(Choice E) Acetazolamide is used to treat open-angle glaucoma and benign intracranial hypertension."

    "options": [
      "A. Metastatic bone disease",
      "B. Plasma cell neoplasia",
      "C. Simvastatin",
      "D. Paget's disease of bone",
      "E. Alcoholic liver disease"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Elevation of alkaline phosphatase can result from many conditions. Most commonly, elevations of this enzyme are seen in hepatobiliary disorders or diseases of bone causing increased bone turnover. The single most common cause of asymptomatic isolated elevation of alkaline phosphatase in an elderly patient is Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). Paget's disease of bone is most commonly diagnosed in asymptomatic individuals when an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase is incidentally discovered on routine blood tests. Bone lesions in this condition are the result of defective osteoid formation at sites of high bone turnover resulting in hypertrophy of bone. The most commonly affected bones are the skull, clavicles, pelvis and long bones. Pathologic fractures, pain, osteosarcoma and neurologic symptoms are possible complications of this condition.\n(Choice A) In patients with prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is usually greater than 4 ng/ml. Prostate cancer with bone metastasis may cause elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase but it will also typically cause bone pain, osteoblastic bone lesions on radiographic studies and hypercalcemia due to some degree of bone resorption despite the blastic nature of the lesions.\n(Choice B) Patients of multiple myeloma will have bone pain and hypercalcemia due to osteolysis as well as monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins in the serum and urine. Weakness, fatigue, weight loss, renal disease and amyloidosis are also not uncommonly observed in this condition.\n(Choice C) Statin drugs, such as simvastatin are not known to cause isolated elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase. They may, however, cause an elevation of the aminotransferases (ALT and AST) or rhabdomyolysis leading to myoglobinuria and renal failure.\n(Choice E) Alcoholic liver disease causes elevations of the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Elevation of the serum AST is disproportionately higher than the serum ALT and the AST to ALT ratio is typically greater than 2 in liver disease due to alcohol use."

      "F. MRI of the brain",
      "G. CT scan of the brain"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has an epidural abscess causing spinal cord compression. Epidural abscesses are enclosed infections in the epidural space. They are characterized by back pain, fever, chills, and leukocytosis. Abscesses are most commonly due to hematogenous spread and tend to occur in injection drug users and immunosuppressed patients. If the abscess grows large enough, it can cause spinal cord compromise by direct compression and by restriction of blood flow to the cord. This patient has findings suggestive of cord compression, including lower extremity weakness and urinary incontinence. The imaging modality of choice is an emergent MRI of the spine. An acute epidural abscess requires immediate surgical debridement to avoid long-term neurologic sequelae. Blood cultures are often positive and should be drawn prior to initiating empiric antibiotic treatment.\n(Choice A) Electromyography (EMG) can be helpful in distinguishing between nerve and muscle disease.\n(Choice B) CT of the spine may reveal an epidural abscess but it is not as sensitive or specific as MRI.\n(Choice C) Lumbar puncture is the procedure of choice for diagnosing meningitis. However, it is not recommended when an epidural abscesses is present because of the theoretical risk of puncturing the abscess and introducing bacteria into the CSF.\n(Choice E) Hemoglobin A1c is a measure of serum glucose concentration over the last three months. It will be elevated in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and is used to make long-term adjustments in diabetes management. Hemoglobin A1c is not an urgent test to order for this patient.\n(Choices F and G) This patient's primary pathology is in the spinal cord, as evidenced by bilateral neurologic deficits only in the lower extremities, localized back pain, and urinary incontinence. The spinal cord rather than the brain should be imaged."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "In evaluating a case of arthritis, it is critical to address the following questions.\n1. Is it an inflammatory process?\n2. Is it monoarticular or polyarticular?\n3. Is it symmetric or asymmetric?\n4. What is the duration of symptoms?\nThis patient presents with an episode of polyarticular and symmetric arthritis of acute onset and short duration. Joint swelling and low-grade fever suggest an inflammatory process. Furthermore, this patient's symptoms resolve in less than two months. Inflammatory symmetric arthritis that resolves within two months is due to viral infection with causative agents including parvovirus, hepatitis, HIV, mumps and rubella among many others. Positive rheumatoid factor and a weakly positive ANA are not surprising findings in viral arthritis. Positive rheumatoid factor may occur in rheumatoid arthritis, viral or bacterial infection and malignancy as well as in normal individuals. ANA is sensitive for SLE, but many other inflammatory conditions including RA, hepatitis and HIV may present with this finding. Additionally, a weakly positive ANA can be found in approximately 5% of normal individuals.\n(Choices A & C) Septic arthritis and crystalline arthritis tend to be monoarticular and most commonly affect the knee. Joint aspiration is important for differentiating the two.\n(Choices B & D) Rheumatoid arthritis and SLE present as symmetric inflammatory arthritides. While this patient has a symmetric inflammatory arthritis, it resolves in less than two months. RA and SLE are chronic conditions that do not resolve in less than four weeks.\n(Choice F) Osteoarthritis is non-inflammatory and does not present with low-grade fever. Additionally, it is a chronic arthritis of insidious onset that typically occurs in patients over 40 years of age.\n(Choice G) Polyarthritis can occur in patients with sarcoidosis; it most often affects the ankles and knees.\n(Choice H) Seronegative spondyloarthropathies include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. These present with asymmetric arthritis and inflammatory back pain with a negative rheumatoid factor.\n(Choice K) Polymyalgia rheumatica occurs most commonly in patients over 50. It is an inflammatory condition which presents with sore and stiff muscles, particularly in the neck and shoulders. The ESR is typically >= 40, while the ANA is typically normal."

      "F. Sudden visual loss"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The features present in this patient are consistent with a diagnosis of dermatomyositis (DM). DM is an autoimmune condition that, in its most classic form, causes a proximal extensor muscle inflammatory myopathy and characteristic cutaneous findings. These cutaneous findings include a violaceous poikiloderma over various regions of the body. On the face, the eruption is most often accompanied by periorbital edema and is known as the heliotrope sign. On the chest and lateral neck it is called the shawl sign. On the knuckles, elbows and knees it is referred to a Gottron's sign. Lichenoid papules overlying the joints are known as Gottron's papules; these are pathognomonic for DM.\nDM is six times more common in females, and the classic autoantibody associated with DM is anti-Mi-2 (against helicase). Internal malignancies have been shown to be more common in patients with DM compared to the general population. Over 10% of patients with adult-onset DM will have such a malignancy. The most common malignancies are ovarian, but breast, lung and other female urogenital cancers may occur in an increased frequency as well.\n(Choice A) Inflammatory diseases associated with aortic aneurysms include Behcet syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, relapsing polychondritis and Reiter syndrome.\n(Choice B) Autoimmune diseases associated with renal failure include systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Goodpasture syndrome, relapsing polychondritis and Wegener granulomatosis among others.\n(Choice C) Inflammatory diseases associated with alveolar hemorrhage include Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, polyarteritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Behcet syndrome and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. DM causes pulmonary fibrosis.\n(Choice E) Inflammatory or depositional diseases associated with carpal tunnel syndrome include rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis and amyloidosis.\n(Choice F) Autoimmune diseases associated with sudden visual loss include temporal arteritis and, rarely, SLE."

He has had lumbar disk herniation in the past but denies any current back pain. He has no other active medical problems. His vital signs are within normal limits. He weighs 95 kg (210 lb) and is 168 cm (66 in) tall. Examination shows pain on passive internal rotation of right hip joint. Direct pressure over the groin did not increase the pain. His reflexes are 2+, and there are no sensory deficits. Muscle bulk, tone and power are within normal limits. Pulses are 2+ in both legs.

      "D. Disruption of bone vasculature",
      "E. Referred pain from the lumbosacral area"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering from degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis, \"wear and tear\" arthritis). Osteoarthritis typically presents indolently in patients over 40 years of age with progressive anterior hip pain exacerbated by walking and relieved by rest. Morning stiffness or stiffness after prolonged resting is a consistent feature, but in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, the morning stiffness of osteoarthritis lasts less than 30 to 60 minutes. Active and passive internal and external rotation of the hip is limited on exam. Tenderness to palpation and systemic symptoms are characteristically absent in osteoarthritis, and pain at rest or overnight occurs only in advanced disease. The etiology is progressive mechanical destruction of the articular cartilage leading to bone-on-bone friction and the formation of osteophytes. Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease. Predisposing factors are advanced age and obesity, particularly for hip and knee arthritis.\n(Choice A) Cutaneous nerve compression may cause hip pain in meralgia paresthetica, a condition where compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve causes lateral hip paresthesia unaffected by motion or palpation.\n(Choice B) Inflammation of the trochanteric bursa (trochanteric bursitis) is caused by friction between the tendons of the gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata over the greater trochanter of the femur. Pain is localized over the lateral hip and is worsened by palpation. Pain caused by pressure on the lateral hip may interfere with sleeping in patients with this condition.\n(Choice D) Disruption of bone vasculature may cause osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is typically associated with chronic corticosteroid use. While this condition may also present with chronic progressive anterior hip / groin pain, there is no history of chronic corticosteroid use.\n(Choice E) Referred pain from the lumbosacral area can cause posterior hip or gluteal pain and when impingement of the lumbar nerve roots occurs pain may radiate laterally down the thigh. Such patients typically have no limitation of hip mobility but will exhibit positive findings on a straight leg raise maneuver."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Young women and individuals with a family history of autoimmune disease are at most commonly affected by SLE. Common presentations of this systemic disease include low-grade fever, weakness, weight loss, rash (malar butterfly, annular, discoid), arthralgias/arthritis, proteinuria and hematologic abnormalities. This patient's elevated ESR, while non-specific, suggests systemic inflammation and is consistent with a diagnosis of SLE. Arthritis affects 90 percent of patients with SLE, and most commonly occurs in the hand or knee. It is a migratory arthritis with pain that is often disproportionate to objective physical findings. The arthritis of SLE is has a lower incidence of erosion, synovial abnormality and permanent joint deformity than that of rheumatoid arthritis; therefore, SLE is considered a non-deforming arthritis.\n(Choice A) Osteophytes are bony growths that develop in the joints of patients with osteoarthritis. This patient's age, family history and systemic illness are far more suggestive of SLE.\n(Choice C) Subluxation of the cervical vertebrae and tendon damage in the hands may occur in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n(Choice D) Cartilage degradation is the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). OA patients may develop muscle atrophy from limitations of joint movement.\n(Choice E) Bone resorption does not occur in SLE. Distal phalangeal resorption is prominent in the arthritis mutilans variant of psoriatic arthritis leading to classic \"pencil-in-cup” deformities."

    "question": "A 36-year-old female who is currently having regular menstrual periods comes to the emergency room because of malaise and a high-grade fever with chills. She also complains of pain in multiple joints. She always uses highly absorbent tampons during her menses. She uses intravenous heroin and cocaine and works as a prostitute. Her temperature is 39.3C (103.4F), pulse is 102/min, blood pressure is 120/80mmHg and respirations are 14/min. Examination shows multiple pustules on the extensor surfaces of her forearms. Joint examination does not show redness, swelling or tenderness. Three sets of blood cultures are negative. Based on these findings, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Infective endocarditis",
      "B. Disseminated gonococcal infection",
      "C. Toxic shock syndrome",
      "D. Acute HIV infection",
      "E. Secondary syphilis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "image": "",
    "explanation": "While the patient described is at risk for all of the above conditions due to her intravenous drug use and work as a prostitute, given all of the details of the presentation, disseminated gonococcemia (DGI) is the most likely diagnosis. DGI results from gonococcal bacteremia in patients with untreated mucosal N. gonorrhoeae infections. Dissemination is most likely to occur during the menstrual periods. Patients experience high fever, chills, tenosynovitis and migratory polyarthralgias early in their illness. Characteristically, the skin lesions number from five to forty and are most commonly seen on the extremities. These lesions are discrete purpuric or pustular lesions with a hemorrhagic component and occasionally central necrosis. This condition may progress to cause suppurative infectious arthritis, but it is important to note that the early arthralgias experienced in this condition are not the result of suppurative arthritis. Blood cultures and cultures from the cutaneous pustules in this condition are often negative due to the specific growth requirements of the strain of N. gonorrhoeae that causes this disseminated form of infection.\n(Choice A) Intravenous drug users are at risk for infective endocarditis, particularly of the valves of the right heart. S. aureus is the most commonly isolated organism, and it can be readily identified in blood cultures if three separate cultures are taken during febrile periods. Described skin lesions are not commonly seen.\n(Choice C) Toxic shock syndrome has been associated with the use of highly-absorbent tampons, particularly if these tampons are left in place for a prolonged period of time. Patients present with fever, erythroderma / desquamation, headache, nausea / vomiting and myalgias. Pustules are not characteristic. Because this is a toxin-mediated illness, blood cultures will be negative.\n(Choice D) The acute HIV syndrome is characterized by a mononucleosis-like reaction with fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, myalgias and arthralgias. The cutaneous manifestations are like those of other viral exanthems, namely, morbilliform macules. Pustules are not characteristic.\n(Choice E) The cutaneous manifestations of secondary syphilis are protean thus explaining why syphilis is regarded as the \"great imitator\". Characteristically, the lesions are morbilliform, psoriasiform or pustular. Condylomata lata typically occur in the anogenital region. Fever and arthralgias may also occur in secondary syphilis. While this diagnosis is a possibility, the cutaneous lesions described are more characteristic of DGI."

    "question": "A 54-year-old retired schoolteacher comes to the physician's office because of worsening low back pain. The pain started three weeks ago. It is continuous and is worse at night. He has had little relief with over-the-counter nonsteroidal analgesics. He has no other symptoms. He had a surgical resection of a lung tumor one year ago for non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. Preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) scanning did not reveal any evidence of metastasis. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows local spinal tenderness at the L4-L5 level. What is the most likely cause of his back pain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lumbar strain",
      "B. Central spinal canal stenosis",
      "C. Disc herniation",
      "D. Vertebral compression fracture",
      "E. Metastatic disease",
      "F. Ankylosing spondylitis",
      "G. Iliac artery thrombosis",
      "H. Vertebral osteomyelitis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Metastatic disease of the vertebrae is the most likely cause of back pain in the patient described, who has already been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. Metastases are the most common malignancy of bone; the most common tumors to metastasize to bone include lung, breast, prostate, thyroid, and kidney. The bone pain caused by bone metastases is typically constant and worse at night. By comparison, the pain caused by degenerative disease is typically exacerbated by exercise and relieved by rest.\n(Choice A) Lumbar strain usually occurs acutely following twisting of the back while lifting heavy weights. It is typically exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest, and there is usually no point tenderness.\n(Choice B) Spinal stenosis typically occurs in the lumbar spine causing low back pain that is relieved with rest and aggravated with activity.\n(Choice C) Disc herniation presents as low back pain radiating down the buttock and below the knee in a dermatomal distribution due to irritation of a nerve root. Positive straight leg and crossed straight leg tests are specific for disc herniation.\n(Choice D) Vertebral compression fractures result from trauma or, more commonly, in the setting of osteoporosis without any history of trauma.\n(Choice F) Ankylosing spondylitis is an HLA-B27-associated seronegative spondyloarthropathy that most commonly affects men in their second or third decade.\n(Choice G) Iliac artery thrombosis may cause low back pain associated with claudication of the hip muscles and possibly impotence.\n(Choice H) Vertebral osteomyelitis may cause chronic progressive pain and a low-grade fever. Point tenderness is often present over the affected vertebrae. The ESR and CRP are typically elevated."

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of one week of fatigue and weakness in her shoulders and hips. She reports difficulty performing household tasks, climbing the stairs, or rising from a chair. She denies any facial weakness or blurry vision. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and takes over the counter ranitidine. Her family history is positive for breast cancer in her mother. Her vital signs are within normal limits and examination shows normal sensation and deep tendon reflexes. Strength is 4 out of 5 in the proximal muscles groups of the arms and legs, and there is no limitation in the range of motion. Other physical examination is within normal limits. The ESR is 80 mm/hour and her serum creatine kinase is elevated. The TSH is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Indomethacin",
      "B. Corticosteroids",
      "C. Colchicine",
      "D. Riluzole",
      "E. Amitriptyline",
      "F. Oxycodone",
      "G. Pyridostigmine"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's history and laboratory findings are suggestive of an inflammatory myopathy, polymyositis and dermatomyositis being the two most common. Peak incidence occurs between 40-50 years of age, and women are more commonly afflicted than men. Both conditions manifest with gradual onset of proximal muscle weakness. Drug-induced myopathy (e.g. caused by statins, antipsychotics, and alcohol), hypothyroid myopathy, muscular dystrophy, and myasthenia gravis may present with similar symptoms. In this patient, elevated ESR and creatinine kinase are supportive of an inflammatory myositis. Inflammatory myopathies are best treated with high dose corticosteroids.\n(Choice A) Indomethacin is potent NSAID. While NSAIDs relieve the joint and muscle pains associated with numerous medical conditions, indomethacin would not stop progression of her inflammatory myopathy.\n(Choice C) Colchicine inhibits neutrophil activity and is used to treat acute flares of gouty arthritis. It is not used to treat inflammatory myopathies.\n(Choice D) Riluzole is used to slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS presents with progressive weakness of the arms, legs and cranial nerves, with a mixture of upper and lower motor neuron signs.\n(Choice E) Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are used to decrease the pain of fibromyalgia. Muscle pain, not objective weakness, is present in fibromyalgia.\n(Choice F) Oxycodone is an opiate used to treat pain, not weakness. Oxycodone would not improve her symptoms or prevent disease progression.\n(Choice G) Pyridostigmine is an anticholinesterase used to treat myasthenia gravis. Most patients with myasthenia have facial and ocular muscle weakness."

    "question": "A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being awoken from sleep by severe pain in his right great toe. He reports that his toe is suddenly swollen and very tender to touch. On review of systems, the patient also describes occasional headaches and pruritus that can be \"unbearable\" after a hot bath. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. On physical examination, his lungs are normal. The liver span is 10 cm and the spleen is palpable 2 cm below the costal margin. Aspiration of the affected toe joint reveals negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Chronic kidney disease",
      "B. Myeloproliferative disorder",
      "C. Hemochromatosis",
      "D. Inherited enzyme deficiency",
      "E. Hyperparathyroidism",
      "F. Pernicious anemia",
      "G. Portal hypertension"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with podagra from an acute attack of gout. Gout occurs as a result of overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. The myeloproliferative disorders are common causes of uric acid overproduction because there is increased catabolism and turnover of purines. The resultant increases in serum uric acid levels can precipitate attacks of gouty arthritis.\nPolycythemia vera commonly causes splenomegaly and characteristic pruritis with hot baths due to histamine release from an increased number of circulating basophils. Up to 40% of patients with polycythemia vera suffer from gout. Based on his history and presentation, this patient is most likely suffering from polycythemia vera-related gout.\n(Choice A) Chronic kidney disease can cause gouty attacks by decreasing the amount of uric acid excreted in the urine. Nothing in this vignette suggests that this patient might have chronic kidney disease.\n(Choice C) Hemochromatosis is an autosomal dominant iron overload syndrome most often due to mutation of the HFE gene. The symptoms of hemochromatosis are related to iron accumulation in various organs: hepatic dysfunction progressing to cirrhosis, diabetes, hypogonadism, skin pigmentation, and arthritis.\n(Choice D) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a genetic deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). The disease is characterized by overproduction of uric acid, behavioral problems (especially self-injurious actions), and neurologic disability, and is generally diagnosed in childhood. This patient is too old for a diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\n(Choice E) Hyperparathyroidism increases bone resorption and can thus elevate serum calcium concentrations. A high serum calcium concentration can cause chondrocalcinosis and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (pseudogout). The crystals in pseudogout are positively birefringent.\n(Choice F) Pernicious anemia is associated with macrocytic anemia and neurologic abnormalities, but not with inflammatory arthritis.\n(Choice G) Portal hypertension can be associated with severe pruritis due to increased serum concentrations of bilirubin. Portal hypertension is not associated with gout, however."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents to your office with two days of back pain. He was moving boxes in the garage when the pain started. The pain is not relieved by lying down and increases in intensity upon straining and coughing. He could not sleep during the night due to pain and took several tablets of acetaminophen without relief. He has never had such pain before. Physical examination reveals symmetric knee reflexes. Plantar reflexes are flexor bilaterally. Straight leg raise is negative. Local tenderness is evident upon percussion of the fourth lumbar vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ligamentous sprain",
      "B. Intervertebral disk degeneration",
      "C. Apophyseal joint arthritis",
      "D. Nerve root demyelinization",
      "E. Vertebral body demineralization"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's intense, focal vertebral pain without neurologic symptoms most likely represents a compression fracture. Vertebral compression fractures almost always occur when bone demineralization is present. This occurs in osteomalacia, where inadequate serum vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus results in demineralized osteoid. It also occurs in osteoporosis, a condition where bone mineral density is decreased and the bone's microarchitecture is disrupted. Pathologic fractures can occur in either condition.\n(Choice A) Ligamentous sprains of the back can often be traced to a specific event or action. However, they are more painful with movement and should feel their best in the morning. Pain is typically perispinal, not directly over a vertebral body.\n(Choice B) Lumbar disk degeneration is the hallmark of lumbar osteoarthritis. This disease presents as low back pain in the elderly. Typically, the pain worsens as the day progresses and is relieved with rest. The timing of this patient's pain is not consistent with osteoarthritis.\n(Choice C) Apophyseal joint arthritis is the hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis. This disease is characterized by pain and progressive limitation of back motion. It most often occurs in young men (<= 40 years). The pain is typically worst in the morning and improves throughout the day.\n(Choice D) Nerve root demyelination can be caused by a number of different processes, including immune-mediated (e.g., Guillain-Barre), toxin or medication-induced, metabolic, hereditary, or infectious processes. Patients will have neurologic abnormalities that correspond to the affected nerve roots. Nerve root demyelination does not typically cause back pain or tenderness to palpation."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency room with acute pain, swelling and redness of his right knee. He had one episode of gouty arthritis a year ago that resolved quickly with indomethacin. He also has type 2 diabetes, hypertension and chronic renal disease. He does not use any illicit drugs. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), blood pressure is 110/85 mmHg, and pulse is 110/min. Examination reveals a tender, erythematous effusion of the right knee with decreased range of motion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": [
      "A. Serum uric acid level",
      "B. Indomethacin",
      "C. X-ray of the knee",
      "D. MRI of the knee",
      "E. Synovial fluid analysis",
      "F. Bone scan"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Given this patient's history of gouty arthritis, his current symptoms most likely represent a gouty flare. After all, he is the typical middle-aged man with acute joint pain, swelling, decreased range of motion, and low-grade fever. In fact, greater than 60% of patients with a first episode of gouty arthritis suffer from a recurrence within one year. Unfortunately, septic arthritis and pseudogout may present similarly to gout and these conditions may even coexist in the same joint. Because of the different treatments for each of these conditions, and the potential for septic arthritis to rapidly destroy the involved joint, synovial fluid analysis is critical for diagnosis. If this patient has gouty arthritis the synovial fluid analysis will reveal a white blood cell count of 2,000-50,000/ml and needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals under polarized light with a negative Gram stain and culture.\n(Choice A) While the underlying cause of gout is an elevated serum uric acid level, the uric acid concentration is neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing gout.\n(Choice B) Indomethacin and colchicine are helpful in treating acute gouty attacks. However, synovial fluid analysis should first be performed to confirm this patient's diagnosis. Furthermore, indomethacin is contraindicated in patients with renal failure or a history of GI bleeding.\n(Choice C) While x-rays of the knee may show distinct findings in chronic gout, x-rays are less reliable than synovial fluid analysis for diagnosing gout.\n(Choice D) MRI of the knee would be more expensive, less sensitive, and less specific for diagnosing gout than synovial fluid analysis.\n(Choice F) Bone scans are commonly used in metastatic work-ups and in evaluating suspected fractures or infections. They are not used to diagnose gout."

    "options": [
      "A. IgE-mediated reaction",
      "B. Immune complex-mediated damage",
      "C. Cytotoxic antibodies",
      "D. Delayed hypersensitivity reaction",
      "E. Non-immune damage"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This clinical vignette describes classical presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): young woman with joint pain, fatigue, ankle edema and facial rash. Although SLE can cause several types of immune-mediated tissue damage and at the same time causes several well defined kidney diseases it is believed that the main mechanism of kidney damage in SLE patients is immune complex-mediated. Immune complexes circulate in the blood and are deposited in renal glomeruli causing their damage via several mechanisms. One of these mechanisms includes complement activation. That's why serum C3 level is decreased in immune complex-mediated kidney diseases such as SLE and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.\nIgE-mediated reaction (choice A) is important in allergic interstitial nephritis like methicillin-induced interstitial nephritis.\nCytotoxic antibodies (choice C) cause Goodpasture's syndrome.\nDelayed hypersensitivity reaction (choice D) may be important in non-specific chronic glomerulonephritis.\nNon-immune kidney damage (choice E) may be related to toxins, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or other factors."

    "question": "A 38-year-old male with steroid-dependent sarcoidosis presents to the physician's office because of progressive right hip pain. He localizes the pain to right groin and states that the pain is present on weight bearing and at rest. His temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F) and blood pressure is 156/86 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased range of motion due to pain. He also has a round face and fullness in supraclavicular area. Purple striae are present on skin. Muscle power is slightly decreased in the proximal thigh muscles in both legs. Reflexes are 2+, and there are no sensory deficits. Plain films of the right hip show no significant abnormalities. ESR is 10 mm/hr. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his hip pain?",
    "options": [
      "A. Inflammatory arthritis",
      "B. Cartilage degeneration",
      "C. Disruption of bone vasculature",
      "D. Inflammation of the trochanteric bursa",
      "E. Aortoiliac occlusion"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely experiencing corticosteroid-related osteonecrosis of his right femoral head. Osteonecrosis is also referred to as aseptic necrosis, avascular necrosis, ischemic necrosis and osteochondritis dessicans. There are numerous factors that are believed to play an etiologic role in this condition. This process, however, proceeds through a common pathway regardless of the suspected etiology. In all cases, the vasculature to the affected bone is disrupted causing bone and bone marrow infarction. Subsequently, the bone is unable to remodel and trabecular thinning occurs ultimately leading to collapse of the affected bone. This process may take months to years, on occasion, to occur. Clinically, the patient experiences progressive pain during this time. In the case of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, patients experience anterior hip pain worsened by activity and relieved by rest with progressive limitation of range of motion. Progression of disease will ultimately cause joint instability and pain at rest. In the first few months of symptoms, x-rays will often fail to demonstrate an abnormality. MRI is the most sensitive test for this condition. Precipitating factors other than chronic corticosteroid use include chronic alcohol use, trauma and the antiphospholipid syndrome.\n(Choice A) There are several forms of inflammatory arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pseudogout, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus and ochronosis among others. Each has a unique presentation, but the case described is most consistent with osteonecrosis related to chronic corticosteroid use.\n(Choice B) Cartilage degeneration occurs in osteoarthritis. This condition typically affects patients over 40 years of age, though such patients may also present with anterior hip pain worsened by activity. This patient’s clinical scenario is more suggestive of osteonecrosis due to the history of chronic corticosteroid use.\n(Choice D) Inflammation of the trochanteric bursa (trochanteric bursitis) is caused by friction between the tendons of the gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata over the greater trochanter of the femur. Pain is localized over the lateral hip and is worsened by palpation. Pain caused by pressure on the lateral hip may interfere with sleeping in patients with this condition.\n(Choice E) Male patients with aortoiliac occlusion (Leriche syndrome) classically present with low back, hip, buttock and thigh claudication accompanied by impotence and atrophy of the lower extremities. Femoral pulses are typically weak and a bruit may be heard over the iliac and femoral arteries."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of easy fatigability over the last several months. She tires easily after walking short distances. She also has difficulties combing her hair due to an inability to hold her hands over her head for a long time. She reports a weight loss of two or three pounds over the last two months. She denies fever or loss of appetite. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. On family history, her father died of a stroke when he was 54 years old and her mother has diabetes mellitus. On examination, she is afebrile with a pulse of 105/min. Cardiac exam reveals regular rhythm with no murmur. Her gait is normal but, when asked to sit down slowly, she drops into the chair. A fine finger tremor is evident when she extends her arms. Her muscles are non-tender to palpation. She appears to have decreased muscle mass in her shoulders. Deep tendon reflexes are normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Upper motor neuron disease",
      "B. Polyneuropathy",
      "C. Inflammatory muscle disease",
      "D. Basal ganglia lesion",
      "E. Cerebellar dysfunction",
      "F. Thyroid disease",
      "G. Neuromuscular junction disorder"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient has hyperthyroidism with an associated myopathy. Although there are many causes of weakness, her weight loss, tremor, tachycardia, and normal reflexes despite muscle wasting on exam are characteristic of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroid myopathy (also known as thyrotoxic myopathy) is found in approximately 50% of patients with hyperthyroidism. Proximal muscle groups of the shoulders and hips are preferentially affected, with weakness and wasting seen on exam. Eye muscle weakness may result in ptosis or diplopia. Deep tendon reflexes are preserved. Hyperthyroid myopathy is slowly progressive but reverses quickly when the underlying hyperthyroidism is treated.\n(Choice A) Weakness caused by upper motor neuron disease is accompanied by hypereflexia and spasticity, and involves only certain muscle groups. This patient's weakness is too diffuse to be easily attributable to an upper motor neuron disorder.\n(Choice B) Polyneuropathies are characterized by weakness and/or sensory changes in the extremities. Pain may be present and reflexes are decreased. Peripheral, rather than proximal, weakness is usually more prominent.\n(Choice C) Inflammatory muscle diseases include polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis. Tremor is not seen in these conditions.\n(Choice D) The basal ganglia are affected in both Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. These diseases are primarily movement disorders, although patients may also have weakness. Parkinson's is characterized by resting tremor and bradykinesia, whereas patients with Huntington's disease demonstrate choreiform movements.\n(Choice E) The cerebellum controls balance and coordination. Thus, cerebellar damage causes ataxia and dysmetria. It is not associated with proximal muscle weakness.\n(Choice G) Myasthenia gravis, a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, is characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity. Similar to hyperthyroid myopathy, deep tendon reflexes are usually preserved. However, tremor, weight loss, and tachycardia are not typical of myasthenia gravis."

    "question": "A 62-year-old male treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia complains of nagging right knee pain that is worse in the evening. The pain has been present for several months and it seems to limit his physical activities. His blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg and his heart rate is 70/min. His BMI is 32 kg/m2 and palpation of the knee reveals a cool joint with bony tenderness. His blood cholesterol level is 200 mg/dl and his serum uric acid level is 9.0 mg/dl. Which of the following additional findings is likely on further examination of the right knee?",
    "options": [
      "A. Soft tissue swelling",
      "B. Painful tibial tuberosity",
      "C. Palpable popliteal mass",
      "D. Bony crepitus",
      "E. Subcutaneous nodules"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This question requires one to be able to diagnose osteoarthritis (OA) from the clinical history alone. In general, patients with OA lack significant physical and laboratory findings, so the diagnosis is generally based on the physician's overall clinical impression. OA most often affects the knee, hip, spine and fingers, and is often monoarticular. In the setting of a painful knee, there are six classic criteria used to establish the diagnosis of OA. These include age >= 50, minimal or no morning stiffness, bony tenderness, bony enlargement, crepitus on active motion and no warmth of the joint. In the case of a painful knee which meets at least three of these criteria, the sensitivity and specificity for OA are 95 and 69 percent, respectively. The above patient's age, lack of morning stiffness, cool knee, and bony tenderness make OA the most likely diagnosis. The patient is also obese, which is an additional risk factor for knee and hip OA. Of the answer choices provided, bony crepitus would be the most likely additional finding. The uric acid level in this patient is mildly elevated, which is non-specific. In the setting of acute rather than slowly progressive monoarticular arthritis, an elevated uric acid level might suggest gout.\n(Choice A) Osteoarthritis is a noninflammatory arthritis, so joint effusions and soft tissue swelling are minimal.\n(Choice B) Pain at the site of the tibial tuberosity may indicate enthesitis, defined as inflammation at the site of tendon insertion into bone. This occurs in spondyloarthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis.\n(Choice C) A palpable popliteal mass suggests a Baker cyst, which most commonly affects patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n(Choice E) Subcutaneous nodules are commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and appear at sites of repetitive trauma, such as the extensor surfaces of the forearm. Nodular protrusions at the DIP and PIP in OA result from bony enlargement and are known as Heberden and Bouchard nodes, respectively."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has symptoms consistent with a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, such as ankylosing spondylitis. This disease is characterized by lower back pain and stiffness, which results in progressive limitation of back motion and chest expansion. It most often occurs in young men (< 40 years of age). Symptoms are typically worst in the morning and improve as the day progresses. Associated findings include arthritis of the peripheral joints and anterior uveitis. X-ray of the pelvis will show changes in the sacroiliac joint consistent with sacroiliitis. Laboratory findings include elevated ESR and negative rheumatoid factor. Ankylosing spondylitis is associated with HLA-B27. Treatment consists of pain relief and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) antagonists.\n(Choice A) Ligamentous sprains of the back can often be traced to a specific event or action. Patients will experience more pain with movement and should feel better in the morning or after rest. This patient's pain is worst in the morning and gradually improves.\n(Choice B) Lumbar osteoarthritis results from disk degeneration, which presents as low back pain in the elderly. Osteoarthritis pain typically worsens with activity and is relieved with rest. This patient's age and the timing of his symptoms are not consistent with osteoarthritis.\n(Choice D) Nerve root demyelination can be caused by a number of different processes, including immune-mediated (e.g., Guillain-Barre), toxin or medication-induced, metabolic, hereditary, or infectious processes. Nerve root demyelination will cause neurologic abnormalities specific to the affected nerves, but would be unlikely to be a source of back pain without neurologic abnormalities.\n(Choice E) Two problems with bone mineralization, osteoporosis and osteomalacia, can both present with pathological fractures. However, this patient's pain is not consistent with a pathological fracture."

      "E. Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies",
      "F. Anticholinesterase antibodies"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is most common in men aged 20-30 years, and presents with progressive back pain and morning stiffness of greater than 3 months duration. Although there are no pathognomonic signs of AS on exam, reduced range of motion in the lower back and sacroiliac tenderness support the diagnosis. In a patient with suggestive signs and symptoms, the diagnosis may be confirmed by a plain film demonstrating sacroiliitis. In addition to skeletal involvement, patients with AS may develop extraarticular manifestations. Anterior uveitis is the most common extraarticular manifestation, occurring in 25- 40% of patients. It presents with monocular pain, blurring and photophobia. There is a strong correlation between HLA-B27 and AS, with HLA-B27 positivity occurring in 90% of all patients afflicted by the disease.\n(Choices A and B) Positive rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies are typically seen in rheumatoid arthritis. AS belongs to the seronegative spondyloarthropathies, so named because they test negative for these serologic markers.\n(Choice C) Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus. This disease may present with arthritis, rash, renal disease, and systemic symptoms, but sacroiliac inflammation is uncommon.\n(Choice E) Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies are seen in 70% of type I diabetics at the time of diagnosis.\n(Choice F) Anticholinesterase antibodies are seen in myasthenia gravis."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency room complaining of 2 days of severe pain and swelling of his right knee. He denies any recent respiratory illness, diarrhea or urinary symptoms. He has a history of severe degenerative joint disease and underwent total knee replacement four years ago. He drinks one can of beer every night and does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. His temperature is 40°C (104°F), blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, and pulse is 110/min. Examination shows warmth, swelling, and tenderness over the knee. His range of motion is restricted. Synovial fluid white blood cell count is 88,000/microL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his current condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Streptococcus species",
      "B. Staphylococcus aureus",
      "C. Neisseria gonorrhoea",
      "D. Chlamydia trachomatis",
      "E. Borrelia burgdorferi",
      "F. Blastomycosis",
      "G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
      "H. Salmonella species"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is suffering from septic arthritis. The presence of a prosthetic joint significantly increases the risk of joint infection. Septic arthritis classically presents with the acute onset of a painful, swollen joint, limited range of motion, and fever. However, crystal-induced arthritis may present similarly, and therefore this patient’s WBC count of 88,000/microL on synovial fluid analysis is critical to the diagnosis. A WBC count of 10,000-50,000/microL may be found in crystal-induced arthritis, whereas a count of 50,000-150,000/microL is strongly suggestive of septic arthritis. Furthermore, while fever is sometimes found in crystal-induced arthritis, a temperature of 104°F is more consistent with a purulent infection. The knee is the most common joint affected by septic arthritis, and hematogenous spread is the most common mechanism. Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent cause of prosthetic joint septic arthritis.\n(Choice A) After Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcal species are the second most common cause of non-gonococcal arthritis. The most reliable way to identify the causative organism in septic arthritis is a gram stain and culture. In the absence of gram stain, this patient's demographics, prosthetic joint, and aggressive infection suggest Staph. aureus is more likely than a streptococcal infection.\n(Choice C) Neisseria gonorrhea is the most common cause of septic arthritis in young, sexually active individuals. It may present as a purulent arthritis affecting one or more joints, or as a polyarthritis associated with tenosynovitis and skin rash.\n(Choice D) Reactive arthritis, often linked to genitourinary infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, presents with the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis.\n(Choice E) Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease. Arthritis, which often affects the knee is a symptom of chronic Lyme disease. A history of tick bite and erythema migrans is classic for Lyme disease. Other chronic sequelae include facial palsy and cardiac conduction abnormalities.\n(Choices F & G) Blastomycosis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are causes of fungal and tuberculous arthritis, respectively. Both are far less common than bacterial arthritis, are less virulent and acute, and present with a lower synovial fluid WBC count.\n(Choice H) Salmonella species and other gram-negative enteric pathogens may cause septic arthritis in immunocompromised and elderly patients."

She has no renal or central nervous system involvement, and her past medical history and review of systems are otherwise negative. Therapy with hydroxychloroquine is started. Which of the following screening tests is most important in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Complete blood count",
      "B. Liver function panel",

      "G. Thyroid stimulating hormone"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The choice of drug therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) depends upon the degree of organ involvement. Hydroxychloroquine is an excellent choice for patients with isolated skin and joint involvement. While it is typically a very safe medication, hydroxychloroquine may cause damage to the eye. The most serious form of eye damage is retinopathy. Corneal damage may also occur. Therefore, eye examinations at 6 month intervals are indicated in all patients taking hydroxychloroquine."

    "question": "A 68-year-old man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes is hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction. It is complicated by pulmonary edema and he undergoes angiography of the left anterior descending artery. On post-operative day 3, he complains of abdominal pain and discoloration of his toes. His vital signs are stable. Examination shows bluish discoloration of his right great toe and of all the toes on his left foot. The skin over the toes is cold and clammy. Bilateral pedal pulses are present and full. His abdomen is soft and mildly tender at the center. Chest auscultation is clear. Laboratory studies show a rise in creatinine to 2.3 g/dL from his baseline of 1.2 g/dL. An EKG shows sinus rhythm and Q waves in anterior leads. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his toe discoloration?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ketoacidosis",
      "B. Vasospasm",
      "C. Right to left shunt",
      "D. Autoimmune vasculitis",
      "E. Uric acid deposition",
      "F. Cholesterol embolism"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient's blue toes, elevated creatinine, and abdominal tenderness are most likely the result of atheromatous emboli dislodged from the aorta during cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization can cause a variety of complications, although the risk-to-benefit ratio of the procedure is generally highly favorable. One of the more common complications is atheroembolism, occuring in 0.6-1.4% of patients. Dislodged plaques may embolize to the cerebral, gastrointestinal, renal, and cutaneous circulation and cause local ischemia and organ dysfunction. \"Blue toe syndrome\" results from emboli to small pedal vessels and is characterized by intact pulses and cyanotic toes. It may be accompanied by livedo reticularis (the result of ischemic lesions in the lower legs). \"Blue toe syndrome\" and elevation of creatinine, resulting from atheroembolism of the pedal and renal circulations, respectively, were the two most common atheroembolic sequelae seen in one major study.\n(Choice A) Ketoacidosis most commonly occurs in the settings of type I diabetes and alcoholism. Given this patient's age, he most likely has type II diabetes, and his symptoms do not resemble ketoacidosis.\n(Choice B) Vasospasm is not a common complication of cardiac catheterization and it is not likely to explain this patient's toe discoloration and elevated creatinine.\n(Choice C) Right-to-left shunts deliver deoxygenated blood to the systemic circulation and result in hypoxemia and cyanosis. Cyanosis should affect not only the toes, but the fingers, and lips as well.\n(Choice D) Autoimmune vasculitis encompasses a broad range of disorders. Some of these diseases result in palpable purpura and renal involvement. This patient's history is far more suggestive of atheroembolism.\n(Choice E) Uric acid deposition is involved in the pathogenesis of gout. Acute gouty arthritis most commonly presents with podagra or inflammation of another peripheral joint. The great toe in podagra will be painful, tender and red, not blue."

    "question": "A 50-year-old man presents to your office complaining of pain and swelling of the right knee. He bumped his right knee into a pole 2 days ago while working. He had one episode of similar pain two years ago that resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He denies any illicit drug use. He has no other medical problems and does not take any medications. His temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), and blood pressure is 126/76 mmHg. Examination reveals swelling, warmth and decreased range of motion of the right knee. All other joints are within normal limits. Synovial fluid analysis shows positive birefringent crystals and negative Gram stain. These crystals are most likely composed of?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hydroxyapatite",
      "B. Monosodium urate",
      "C. Calcium pyrophosphate",
      "D. Calcium oxalate",
      "E. Ammonium phosphate"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's history and synovial fluid analysis are suggestive of pseudogout, the acute form of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal disease. Attacks of pseudogout often occur in the setting of trauma, surgery, or medical illness. This patient's knee trauma was the likely precipitant of his condition. Patients with pseudogout present with acute pain, swelling, redness, and limited motion of the involved joint(s), with the knee being most commonly affected (>=50% of cases). Fever, leukocytosis with a left shift, and chondrocalcinosis (calcified articular cartilage) may also occur in pseudogout. While this patient's history is consistent with pseudogout, gout and septic arthritis may present similarly. Therefore, the diagnosis cannot be made based on history and examination alone. Synovial fluid analysis is critical for distinguishing between these conditions. The identification of rhomboid, positively birefringent crystals on synovial fluid analysis is diagnostic of pseudogout.\n(Choice A) Hydroxyapatite is the complexed form of calcium found in teeth and bones. However, it can also exist in the cartilage of patients with degenerative osteoarthritis and may be isolated from synovial fluid of such patients.\n(Choice B) Monosodium urate crystal deposition is seen in gout. These crystals are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent on synovial fluid analysis.\n(Choice D) Calcium oxalate is the most common crystal found in renal calculi. Calcium oxalate crystals are not isolated from synovial fluid.\n(Choice E) Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) may be found in the renal calculi of patients with urinary tract infection caused by urease-producing organisms (Klebsiella, Proteus)."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents to the clinic with one week of escalating lower back pain. He describes the pain as dull and aching. It increases with motion and it is not completely relieved by rest. He has no significant past medical history. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and consumes alcohol occasionally. He admits to being \"under a lot of stress\" and has recently used injectable drugs. His family history is significant for prostate cancer in his father. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Gentle percussion over the lumbar vertebrae elicits pain. A full neurologic exam including straight leg raise is normal. Laboratory results are shown below:\nComplete blood count\nLeukocyte count 6,500/mm3\nHematocrit 46%\nPlatelets 400,000/mm3\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Ankylosing spondylitis",
      "B. Lumbar disk herniation",
      "C. Lumbar spinal stenosis",
      "D. Vertebral osteomyelitis",
      "E. Vertebral compression fracture",
      "F. Prostate cancer"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has vertebral osteomyelitis. Injection drug users, patients with sickle cell anemia, and immunosuppressed patients are at highest risk for osteomyelitis. The spine is a frequent site of osteomyelitic infection in injection drug users. In this group, S. aureus is the most common pathogen, but infections with gram-negative organisms also occur frequently. Tenderness to gentle percussion over the spinous process of the involved vertebra is the most important clue. Fever is an inconsistent finding. WBC count may be normal or elevated. The ESR is often significantly elevated (>=100 mm/h). MRI is the most sensitive diagnostic study. The treatment is long-term IV antibiotics with or without surgery.\n(Choice A) Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by pain and progressive limitation of back motion. It most often occurs in young men. Symptoms are usually worst in the morning and improve as the day progresses. Tenderness to palpation is not a classic finding.\n(Choice B) Lumbar disk herniation typically presents with the acute onset of back pain with or without radiation down one leg. Patients can usually recall an inciting event. The pain is worse with activity and improves with rest. The spine will not be tender to palpation.\n(Choice C) Lumbar spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal with compression of one or more of the spinal roots. Most affected patients are over age 60. Patients experience back pain that radiates to the buttocks and thighs. Symptoms often worsen with walking and lumbar extension and improve with lumbar flexion. Numbness and paresthesias may occur. The diagnosis is confirmed with MRI\n(Choice E) Vertebral compression fractures can cause local tenderness to palpation, but this usually occurs in elderly patients with history of osteoporosis.\n(Choice F) Although prostate cancer is a possibility, the young age of this patient, localized pain on palpation, lack of night pain, and lack of urinary symptoms make this a less likely diagnosis."

    "question": "A 35-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician's office complaining of blurred vision, cough and shortness of breath. For the past few days she has had mild fevers, malaise and easy fatigability. She has never had these symptoms before and is anxious to uncover a diagnosis. She was recently incarcerated for two months. She practices unprotected sex with her new boyfriend. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F) and her blood pressure is 116/80 mmHg. On exam, her right eye is red and slit lamp examination shows leukocytes in the anterior chamber. Lungs have patchy rales. Chest x-ray shows bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates and hilar adenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Acute HIV infection",
      "B. Disseminated tuberculosis",
      "C. Sarcoidosis",
      "D. Histoplasmosis",
      "E. Ankylosing spondylitis",
      "F. Hodgkin's lymphoma"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is best explained by sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic illness that most commonly afflicts African-American woman in the third and fourth decades of life. Half of cases are diagnosed based on incidental findings on chest x-rays. In those patients who present symptomatically, the most common complaints are cough, dyspnea, fever, and weight loss. While the lungs are the most frequently involved organ system, the skin (erythema nodosum), eyes (anterior uveitis), joints (arthritis), and many other organ systems may be affected. Classic findings on chest x-ray include bilateral hilar adenopathy and reticular opacities, both of which are present in this patient. The description of a red eye with leukocytes in the anterior chamber is consistent with anterior uveitis.\n(Choice A) This patient is at some risk of acute HIV infection given her unprotected sex with a new partner. Symptoms of acute HIV infection are non-specific and include fever, arthralgias, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous lesions, diarrhea, and weight loss. The findings on x-ray and ophthalmologic exam are inconsistent with acute HIV infection.\n(Choice B) Recent incarceration is a risk factor for tuberculosis (TB). On chest x-ray, primary TB presents with lower lobe infiltrates while reactivation presents with apical nodules or cavitary lesions. Cough, hemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, and fever are common. Disseminated disease may affect any organ system. This patient's chest x-ray, signs and symptoms are more suggestive of sarcoidosis.\n(Choice D) Histoplasmosis is most common in the Ohio River Valley and primarily affects the lungs. Histoplasmosis may present similarly to both sarcoidosis and TB in terms of pulmonary symptoms and radiographic findings. However, anterior uveitis is not consistent with histoplasmosis. Rather, damage to the retina is the most common ocular manifestation in histoplasmosis.\n(Choice E) Anterior uveitis frequently occurs in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). However, AS presents with pain, stiffness and limited range of motion of the lower back. Pulmonary infiltrates and hilar adenopathy are not characteristic of AS.\n(Choice F) Hodgkin's lymphoma is most common in young adults. It typically presents with painless, swollen lymph nodes, and hilar adenopathy. \"B symptoms\" of fever and weight loss may be present. The absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy and the occurrence of anterior uveitis make sarcoidosis more likely in this patient."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to his physician with 6 months of mild intermittent pain in both knees. The pain is aggravated by walking and weight bearing, and is partially relieved by rest. He also complains of morning stiffness that lasts for 10 minutes. He does not smoke but drinks alcohol occasionally. His BMI is 25 Kg/m2, temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg.

      "C. Acetaminophen",
      "D. Colchicine",
      "E. Oxycodone",
      "F. Allopurinol",
      "G. Methotrexate",
      "H. Prednisone"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) should be considered in patients greater than 40 years of age presenting with knee pain. In addition to age, pain that is aggravated by activity and relieved with rest is consistent with OA. Morning stiffness of greater than 30 minutes suggests inflammatory arthritis; 10 minutes of morning stiffness is consistent with OA, a non-inflammatory arthritis. Crepitus is a popping sound and feeling that occurs in OA as a result of cartilage erosion and incongruous joint surfaces. The initial drug of choice for pain relief in mild to moderate OA is acetaminophen. It has proven efficacy and a favorable side effect profile.\n(Choice A) Antibiotics are necessary for treating septic arthritis, a highly inflammatory monoarticular arthritis. It presents with acute pain and fever.\n(Choice B) Ketorolac is an NSAID. While NSAIDs have proven efficacy in treating OA, gastrointestinal and renal side effects with long-term use make them second-line agents. Short-term use minimizes the risk of side effects and is helpful for treating OA exacerbations.\n(Choice D) Colchicine is used to treat OA that is refractory to NSAIDs and intra-articular steroids. Its efficacy may be due to the presence of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal (CPPD) in affected joints.\n(Choice E) Opioids such as oxycodone are sometimes used to treat acute exacerbations of OA. However, they are not a first-line agent because of the risk of confusion, sedation, constipation, and abuse.\n(Choice F) Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase and decreases uric acid production. It decreases gouty attacks but has no role in the management of OA.\n(Choice G) Methotrexate is an antimetabolite used in the management of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It has no role in treating OA.\n(Choice H) Prednisone is an oral steroid used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and gout. Oral steroids have no role in treating OA but intra-articular corticosteroid injections can be useful in flare-ups."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with right shoulder pain and weakness after falling on his outstretched hand. The pain is worse when he tries to position his arm above the shoulder level or when he pulls or pushes. He also complains of pain when he lies on the affected shoulder. He has a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking. His father died of multiple myeloma. His vital signs are within normal limits.

      "A. X-ray shoulder",
      "B. Chest-X ray",
      "C. Bone marrow biopsy",
      "D. MRI of the shoulder",
      "E. MRI of the cervical spine",
      "F. Aspiration of the joint",
      "G. Bone scan"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering from a rotator cuff tear. This condition presents with shoulder pain and weakness. The pain is aggravated by pushing, pulling, lifting the arm above the head, and lying on the affected shoulder. Rotator cuff tears may occur as the end result of chronic rotator cuff tendonitis or as a result of trauma. The classic presentation of trauma-induced rotator cuff tear involves a fall on an outstretched hand. Limitation of mid arc abduction and external rotation are common findings on exam. The fact that this patient's limitation of movement remains after lidocaine injection provides strong support for a diagnosis of rotator cuff tear. While rotator cuff tendinitis may present with similar pain and limitation of movement, the symptoms of rotator cuff tendinitis resolve with lidocaine injection. An MRI of the shoulder is the test of choice for diagnosing a rotator cuff tear.\n(Choice A) An x-ray of the shoulder is an inexpensive way of diagnosing fractures, dislocations, and calcific tendonitis. However, MRI is superior at evaluating soft tissue structures of the shoulder.\n(Choice B) With this patient's extensive smoking history, a lung cancer involving the brachial plexus could cause shoulder pain. However, brachial plexus damage is not corroborated by this patient's exam.\n(Choice C) Though this patient has a family history of multiple myeloma, his clinical picture is not consistent with this diagnosis. Multiple myeloma typically presents with pain in the spine, ribs, or back. It may be accompanied by hypercalcemia and anemia. Bone marrow biopsy is a poor choice to evaluate this patient's shoulder complaints.\n(Choice E) MRI of the spine would help to identify of the cause of cervical radiculopathy. This condition may result from disc herniation (osteophytes) and presents with arm weakness, paresthesias, and neck pain.\n(Choice F) Aspiration of synovial fluid is useful for identifying septic and crystal-induced arthritis. The absence of swelling, warmth and fever make these diagnoses unlikely.\n(Choice G) Bone scans are used to diagnoses osteomyelitis, fractures, and metastatic disease. This patient’s history and physical is not consistent with one of these diagnoses."

Fibromyalgia is one of the most common pain syndromes encountered, and it is approximately ten times more common in women. It is most commonly diagnosed in patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Patients will often also complain of disturbed sleep, easy fatigability and muscle stiffness. Laboratory values are typically normal. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline have been shown to be effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia. These drugs are given in low doses at nighttime and are able to provide an increase in restorative stage 4 sleep. Cyclobenzaprine may be used in a similar manner. In patients exhibiting depression in addition to fibromyalgia, treatment with SSRIs should be initiated as well.\n(Choices A & C) Fibromyalgia is not an inflammatory condition. Glucocorticoids or NSAIDs, such as naproxen, have not been shown to be very effective in its treatment.\n(Choice D) Colchicine that is used for the acute treatment of gout has no role in the management of fibromyalgia.\n(Choice E) Narcotic analgesics like oxycodone should be avoided in patients with fibromyalgia as dependence may occur.\n(Choice F) Methotrexate is used to treat inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "It is important to be familiar with the basic strategy of the management of patients with acute back pain. This patient presents with acute onset of pain and positive straight-leg raise test that suggest that disk herniation may be the cause of the problem. At the same time, no neurologic deficit is present and the perianal area is intact (it is always important to rule out cauda equina syndrome). These patients are managed conservatively. In randomized clinical trials, patients did better without bed rest than with it; so, bedrest is no longer advised for this type of low back pain. Patients should be advised to return to daily activities as soon as possible. Pain and stiffness is better managed with NSAIDs and muscle relaxants. An exercise program (Choice F) has also not been shown to be beneficial for this type of pain. If the pain persists after 4-6 weeks of conservative treatment or progressive neurologic deficit evolves, high-resolution diagnostic modalities are usually employed: MRI (Choice A) and CT with or without contrast myelography (Choice B).\nEmergency surgical decompression (Choice E) is indicated in case of significant or rapidly progressive neurologic deficit (foot drop, weakness of the legs).\nPlain roentgenogram (Choice D) is used in patients with osteoporosis and possible vertebral crush fractures.

      "D. Rheumatoid factor",
      "E. Heberden nodes",
      "F. Chlamydial infection"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Pseudogout is a form of acute arthritis induced by the release of calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) crystals from sites of chondrocalcinosis (calcification of articular cartilage) into the joint space. It often occurs in the setting of recent surgery or medical illness. Patients present with acute pain, swelling, redness and limited motion of the involved joint(s), with the knee being most commonly affected. Fever, leukocytosis and a left shift may occur in pseudogout, although the presence of these findings is not required for diagnosis. The crystals of CPPD can be difficult to detect on synovial fluid analysis, but the identification of rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent crystals is diagnostic.\n(Choice A) Tophi are collections of urate crystals which form firm, yellowish nodules at the sites of involved joints in patients with chronic gout. The presentation of gout and pseudogout can be similar, but gout is distinguished by needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals.\n(Choice B) Transient bacteremia could lead to septic arthritis causing acute pain and swelling of the knee in the setting of fever and leukocytosis. However, the negative gram stain and presence of rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent crystals in this case make pseudogout the more likely explanation. S. aureus is the most common cause of septic arthritis.\n(Choice D) Positive rheumatoid factor (RF) is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but finding a positive RF does not necessarily make the diagnosis of RA as it can occur in many other conditions. RA presents with gradual onset symmetric arthritis; fever may be present. This patient's acute onset of pain, recent surgery and crystals in the synovial fluid are more consistent with pseudogout.\n(Choice E) Heberden nodes occur in the DIP joints in osteoarthritis and form from calcified cartilaginous spurs. Osteoarthritis may predispose to pseudogout, but osteoarthritis alone cannot account for the acute onset, inflammation, fever and synovial fluid analysis in this case.\n(Choice F) Chlamydial infection can result in Reiter syndrome (reactive arthritis). The triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis and arthritis compose the classic presentation. Lower extremity oligoarthritis and enthesopathy (inflammation at tendon and ligament insertions) account for musculoskeletal complaints."

    "question": "A 43-year-old Caucasian female presents to your office complaining of joint pain and swelling in her hand. On history, she endorses easy fatigability and loss of energy that has been worsening insidiously. It is especially difficult for her to do daily activities in the morning due to prolonged stiffness. She also describes frequent knee pain accompanied by a low-grade fever. She takes ibuprofen and naproxen to relieve her symptoms. Her hematocrit is 33%. The patient is at the greatest risk of which of the following?",
    "options": [
      "A. Osteitis fibrosis cystica",
      "B. Osteitis deformans",
      "C. Avascular bone necrosis",
      "D. Osteomalacia",
      "E. Osteoporosis",
      "F. Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects females more often than males and has a typical age of onset of 30-50 years. Morning stiffness of greater than one hour is typical of RA and would explain this patient's difficulty with morning activities. Symmetric joint swelling is typical. The most commonly affected joints include the MCPs, PIPs, wrists and knees. Due to the autoimmune nature of the disease, systemic symptoms such as fatigue, fever and anemia often occur. It is also well documented that patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at an increased risk of developing osteopenia and osteoporosis. This is likely due to the combined effects of the disease process itself, glucocorticoid therapy, female sex and decreased ability to perform weight-bearing exercises that prevent osteoporosis.\n(Choice A) Osteitis fibrosis cystica (Von Recklinghausen disease of bone) is a condition in which osteoclastic resorption of bone leads to replacement with fibrous tissue (brown tumors). Hyperparathyroidism is the cause.\n(Choice B) Paget's disease of bone is a condition of increased bone turnover due to osteoclast overactivity leading to the replacement of lamellar bone with abnormal woven bone.\n(Choice C) Avascular necrosis is most commonly seen with the use of systemic glucocorticoids and alcohol. Patients with lupus and sickle cell disease are also at risk. Glucocorticoids may be used in patients with RA and therefore avascular necrosis is possible in this patient. however, glucocorticoids are not mentioned in the vignette, and osteoporosis is more common in patients with RA.\n(Choice D) Osteomalacia is a disorder of bone mineralization that causes decreased bone density. Vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency, parathyroidectomy and renal tubular acidosis are potential causes.\n(Choice F) Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor. Radiation and chemotherapy exposure, as well as Paget's disease, are known risk factors in adults diagnosed with osteosarcoma."

    "question": "A 31-year-old Caucasian male complains of joint pains. He describes right knee pain, right heel pain and low-back pain. He was recently treated for urethral discharge at an outside clinic. He has no history of trauma or illicit drug use. He is afebrile, and his vital signs are stable. His right knee is swollen, tender and warm to touch; tenderness is also present over the Achilles tendon. Oral examination shows mouth ulcers. Synovial fluid analysis from the right knee shows a white blood cell count of 10,000/mm3 with many polymorphonuclear leukocytes but a negative Gram stain. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antihistamines",
      "B. NSAIDs",
      "C. Antibiotics",
      "D. Colchicine",
      "E. Allopurinol",
      "F. Chondroitin sulfate"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome) is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Classic Reiter syndrome consists of a triad of nongonococcal urethritis, asymmetric oligoarthritis and conjunctivitis. The arthritis often involves the knee and sacroiliac spine, which explains this patient's back pain. In addition to the classic triad, mucocutaneous lesions and enthesitis (Achilles tendon pain) are common findings in reactive arthritis. Because not all symptoms are always present, there should be a high suspicion for reactive arthritis in the case of any asymmetric oligoarthritis associated with urethritis, conjunctivitis or mouth ulcers. Synovial fluid analysis is usually sterile. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are the first line therapy during the acute phase of this condition.\n(Choice A) Reactive arthritis is not a histamine mediated process; therefore, antihistamines would not improve the patient's arthritis or oral ulcers.\n(Choice C) It is difficult to distinguish gonococcal septic arthritis from reactive arthritis because synovial fluid cultures can be negative in 50% of patients with gonococcal septic arthritis. However, this patient is afebrile and has other symptoms suggestive of reactive arthritis, such as mouth ulcers, enthesitis and low back pain.\n(Choice D) Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug used for the treatment of acute gout. It acts by decreasing leukocyte activity primarily by inhibiting tubulin polymerization.\n(Choice E) Allopurinol is used in the management of chronic hyperuricemia. It decreases uric acid production by inhibition of xanthine oxidase.\n(Choice F) Loss of articular cartilage causes osteoarthritis. Many patients suffering from osteoarthritis take chondroitin sulfate, a component of the ground substance that composes cartilage, to improve their condition and symptoms; however it has not been definitively shown to improve symptoms and outcomes."

    "question": "A 32-year-old Caucasian male complains of inability to grip his cup of coffee and hold a pen in the morning. He says that he is ‘fully functional’ in the afternoon. His ESR is 45 mm/hr. Which of the following is most likely to be affected by this patient's disease?",
    "options": [
      "A. Sacral spine",
      "B. Sacroiliac joints",
      "C. Lumbar spine",
      "D. Thoracic spine",
      "E. Cervical spine"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's complaints are consistent with morning stiffness affecting the hands. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) would best explain this patient's condition, as RA affects the MCP, PIP and wrist joints, causes morning stiffness and affects younger patients. RA is also a disease of systemic inflammation, so this patient's elevated ESR, though nonspecific, supports the diagnosis. While almost all patients with RA develop a symmetric arthritis of their peripheral joints, involvement of the axial skeleton is less universal. However, when axial skeleton involvement does occur, the cervical spine is most frequently affected resulting in neck pain, stiffness and hyperreflexia.\n(Choices A — D) The sacral spine, sacroiliac joints, lumbar spine and thoracic spine are less commonly affected by RA than the cervical spine. The sacroiliac joints are commonly affected in seronegative spondyloarthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome and psoriatic arthritis, while the lumbar spine is the most common site of disc herniation and spinal stenosis. The thoracic spine has great stability and is rarely affected by arthritis, disc herniation or other spinal disorders."

    "question": "A 21-year-old woman presents with 4 months of slowly progressive low back pain. Her back pain is associated with early morning stiffness that improves as the day progresses. She has no fever or gastrointestinal complains. She denies any recent illness. On examination, there is limited range of motion of her back. Other examination is unremarkable. Plain X-ray films show bilateral sacroiliitis. Which of the following conditions is this patient at greatest risk of developing?",
    "options": [
      "A. Aortic coarctation",
      "B. Thoracic aortic aneurysm",
      "C. Renal failure",
      "D. Oral ulcers",
      "E. Anterior uveitis",
      "F. Ischemic optic neuropathy",
      "G. Episcleritis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Although ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is more common in young males, it is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with low back pain and sacroiliitis. The male-to-female ratio of AS is 2-3:1. The highest incidence of AS occurs between ages 20-30 years, and there is a strong association with HLA-B27. AS is primarily a disease of the axial skeleton, causing progressive back pain and spinal stiffness. Morning stiffness and improvement with exercise are typical. AS may be definitively diagnosed in a patient with symptoms of AS and bilateral sacroiliitis on plain film. Anterior uveitis is the most common extra-articular manifestation of AS and occurs in 25-40% of patients.\n(Choice A) Aortic coarctation is associated with Turner's syndrome. Patients with AS do not have an increased incidence of aortic coarctation, but they are at risk of aortic regurgitation secondary to scarring of the aortic valve cusps.\n(Choice B) Thoracic aortic aneurysm is associated with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and syphilis. It also has an association with many inflammatory arthritides, including AS. Therefore, this patient is at some increased risk of developing a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Nonetheless, her odds of developing acute uveitis are far greater.\n(Choice C) Patients with AS may develop secondary amyloidosis and IgA nephropathy. However, these complications are less common than acute uveitis and only occasionally lead to renal failure.\n(Choice D) Oral ulcers are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, and Behcet's disease. However, there is not a strong association between AS and development of oral ulcers.\n(Choice F) Ischemic optic neuropathy is a feared complication of temporal arteritis. It results from vasculitis of the retinal artery and may cause blindness. This condition is not associated with AS.\n(Choice G) Episcleritis is most strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. There is no strong association between AS and episcleritis."

    "question": "A 30-year-old female comes to your office with a complaint of pain over the lateral side of her wrist for the last four days. She is two months postpartum and notes that her pain is most severe when she lifts her infant from a crib. On examination, there is tenderness over the radial side of wrist and first dorsal compartment. Passive stretching of the thumb tendons over the radial styloid while the thumb is held in flexion aggravates the pain. She denies any recent trauma over the tender area. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Osteoarthritis of first metacarpophalangeal joint",
      "B. Trigger thumb",
      "C. De Quervain tenosynovitis",
      "D. Scaphoid fracture",
      "E. Flexor carpi radialis tenosynovitis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described most likely has De Quervain tenosynovitis, a condition that classically affects new mothers who hold their infants with the thumb outstretched (abducted / extended). This condition is caused by inflammation of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons as they pass through a fibrous sheath at the radial styloid process. Tenderness can typically be elicited with direct palpation of the radial side of the wrist at the base of the hand. Additionally, the Finkelstein test, which is conducted by passively stretching the affected tendons by grasping the flexed thumb into the palm with the fingers, elicits pain.\n(Choice A) Osteoarthritis of first metacarpophalangeal joint would cause pain with activity over the first metacarpophalangeal joint, not at the carpometacarpal joint.\n(Choice B) Trigger thumb results in pain over the palmar aspect of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and locking of the thumb in flexion.\n(Choice D) Scaphoid fractures typically occur during forceful hyperextension of the wrist as may occur in a fall on an outstretched hand. Pain typically localizes to the anatomic snuffbox.\n(Choice E) Flexor carpi radialis tenosynovitis results in pain with radial flexion of the wrist and point tenderness over the trapezium."

    "question": "A 44-year-old female complains of generalized weakness, low-grade fever and joint pain. Her daily activities are limited due to joint stiffness, especially in the morning. Her hand joints are swollen symmetrically. The inferior pole of the spleen is palpable on physical examination. Her hematocrit is 34%. Liver and renal function tests are normal. Two months after the initial visit, the patient develops painful oral ulcers. Her laboratory values are:\nHematocrit 33%\nAST 120 U/L\nALT 90 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 80 U/L\nBilirubin 1.1 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nBUN 16 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current complaints?",
    "options": [
      "A. Viral hepatitis",
      "B. Felty syndrome",
      "C. Lymphoid cell proliferation",
      "D. Antimetabolite agent",
      "E. Corticosteroid treatment",
      "F. Anti-cytokine agent"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The history of symmetric swelling of the hand joints, morning stiffness, fever and generalized weakness provided on the patient's initial visit are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). At that visit, she was likely started on medication for RA. On the return visit two months later, she has painful oral ulcers and liver function test (LFT) abnormalities. These findings are most likely the result of methotrexate, an antimetabolite agent that is classically used as a first-line DMARD agent in RA. Common side effects of methotrexate include stomatitis, nausea, abdominal pain and fever. Methotrexate can also cause hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression. This patient presents with stomatitis, anemia and hepatotoxicity.\n(Choice A) There is no indication of exposure to viral hepatitis (travel, sex, IVDA) between this patient's initial visit and the 2 month follow-up visit. Furthermore, acute hepatitis would likely present with more dramatic increases in the ALT and AST, jaundice and a viral prodrome of fever, malaise, nausea and vomiting.\n(Choice B) Felty syndrome is an uncommon form of RA accompanied by splenomegaly and granulocytopenia (neutrophil count <2,000/mm3). Granulocytopenia generally does not occur until symptoms of arthritis have been present for over 10 years; this patient's arthritis is of recent onset. Splenomegaly is a common finding in patients with RA without granulocytopenia; these patients are not considered to have Felty syndrome.\n(Choice C) Lymphoid cell proliferation would not be expected to cause LFT elevations. Lymphoma can present with fatigue and a palpable spleen, but the patient's history is otherwise not consistent with the diagnosis.\n(Choice E) Corticosteroid treatment is often used in RA, and it causes numerous adverse effects including thinning of the skin, immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, gastritis and psychosis among others. LFT elevation and oral ulcers are not expected.\n(Choice F) Anti-cytokine agents such as infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab may be used in RA, and rare side effects include predisposition to infection, cytopenia and development of lymphoma. LFT elevation is not common."

    "question": "A 70-year-old male presents with malaise, pain and stiffness of his neck, shoulders and hips for the last 3 months. His stiffness is worse in the morning and lasts about 30-40 minutes. He also complains of a recent weight loss of 7lbs and mild fevers. He has no headache, scalp tenderness, visual symptoms or jaw claudication. Examination shows no swelling or tenderness of the involved joints with normal range of motion on active and passive movement. The arteries of the scalp, neck and extremities are normally palpable without any tenderness. Labs show a hematocrit of 31% and an ESR of 65 mm/hr. Blood cultures are negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Temporal artery biopsy",
      "B. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents",
      "C. Treatment with low-dose prednisone",
      "D. Treatment with high-dose prednisone",
      "E. Measure antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor levels"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The above patient is most likely suffering from polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The features required to make a diagnosis of PMR include age over 50 years, aching pain in the neck, shoulders and pelvic girdle lasting at least one month, morning stiffness lasting over one hour and an elevated ESR (>= 40mm/hr) in the absence of other diseases that may account for these symptoms. In PMR, the physical examination is frequently unremarkable with patients denying tenderness with active or passive range of motion. Signs of inflammation in the joints are absent. When asked to identify the location of their pain, patients typically indicate that it is in the soft tissues and not the joints. The treatment of choice for polymyalgia rheumatica is low-dose prednisone.\n(Choice B) NSAIDs may be needed to treat mild breakthrough discomfort associated with PMR, but they are not able to replace the effect of systemic corticosteroids.\n(Choices A & D) PMR may occur alone, but it commonly occurs in association with giant cell arteritis. Emergent high-dose prednisone therapy is used when giant cell arteritis is present to prevent visual loss. Temporal artery biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. Features of giant cell arteritis include headache, jaw-claudication, visual changes, abnormalities of the temporal artery, constitutional symptoms and the findings of PMR. In the above patient, there is no evidence of giant cell arteritis and therefore high-dose prednisone therapy and temporal artery biopsy are not required.\n(Choice E) ANA assessment has no role in the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. It is a nonspecific test that may be positive in systemic lupus erythematosus, drug-induced lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis and other autoimmune conditions."

      "C. Antimitochondrial antibodies",
      "D. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies",
      "E. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Systemic sclerosis is a clinically heterogenous condition that can affect every organ system in the body. The cutaneous findings are those of scleroderma. Thickening of the skin begins in acral sites (hands and feet) with edema that transitions to dermal sclerosis with obliteration of skin appendages (hair follicles and sweat glands) and flexion contractures. Raynaud phenomenon and calcinosis cutis are also commonly observed. The face may take on a \"mask-like\" appearance due to dermal thickening. Connective tissue thickening, the product of myofibroblast proliferation and increased collagen and ground substance production, is the underlying pathogenesis of many of the features of systemic sclerosis. Involvement of the kidneys produces hypertension, and before the advent of ACE inhibitors scleroderma renal crisis was the most common cause of death in these patients. Pulmonary arterial hypertension ultimately results in right heart failure in patients with scleroderma. Esophageal and gastric dysmotility cause these patients to suffer GERD. Antinuclear autoantibodies are present in all patients with scleroderma; anti-topoisomerase-I antibodies would most likely be present in the patient described.\n(Choice B) Rheumatoid factor is classically observed in rheumatoid arthritis, but may also be observed in SLE, Sjogren syndrome, dermatomyositis, HCV infection and others.\n(Choice C) Antimitochondrial antibodies are associated with primary biliary cirrhosis.\n(Choice D) Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are present in Wegener granulomatosis, a form of granulomatous vasculitis.\n(Choice E) Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are observed in autoimmune hepatitis."

      "H. Bone scan",
      "I. Bone marrow biopsy"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Polymyositis (PM) is an inflammatory muscle disease of unknown etiology. It presents initially with slowly progressive proximal weakness of the lower extremities characterized by difficulty ascending and descending stairs or rising from a seated position. The weakness usually progresses over the course of years; an acute presentation is not typical. Proximal arm weakness usually follows leading to complaints of difficulty with combing hair or working with the hands overhead. There are no skin findings in PM, which helps to distinguish it from dermatomyositis. In PM, the muscles of mastication and facial expression are classically spared; however, patients with polymyositis may develop dysphagia due to involvement of the striated muscles of the upper pharynx. Weakness is the primary complaint in patients with PM, and while muscle tenderness may be present, severe tenderness or tenderness in the absence of weakness should lead to the consideration of other diagnoses such as polymyalgia rheumatica. A muscle biopsy is the best diagnostic study for polymyositis. MRI of the affected muscles can assist in identifying the best location for a muscle biopsy. Biopsy in polymyositis shows a mononuclear infiltrate surrounding necrotic and regenerating muscle fibers. In more advanced disease, an inflammatory infiltrate may be absent and replacement of muscle with fibrotic tissue may be evident.\n(Choice A) MRI of the spine is useful in identifying conditions that may cause compression of the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots such as herniated discs or spinal stenosis.\n(Choice B) Electroencephalography (EEG) is used primarily in the evaluation of patients with seizure or sleep disorders.\n(Choice C) A temporal artery biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis of temporal arteritis.\n(Choice D) Lumbar puncture is useful in diagnosing meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage and inflammatory conditions of the CNS such as multiple sclerosis."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient described is displaying clinical signs and symptoms consistent with Sjogren syndrome. Sjogren syndrome is an autoimmune condition that most commonly affects women in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Clinical findings include keratoconjunctivitis sicca (xerophthalmia, dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth). Due to the antimicrobial and lubricating properties of normal saliva, patients with Sjogren syndrome, who lack normal amounts of saliva, will have an increased incidence of dental caries and will complain of difficulty swallowing. Lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands in Sjogren syndrome will cause enlargement and firmness to palpation of these glands. The diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome is made when there is subjective and objective evidence of dry mouth and eyes in the presence of either histologic evidence of lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands or serum autoantibodies directed against SSA (Ro) and / or SSB (La).\n(Choice B) Antimitochondrial antibodies are associated with primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune disease characterized clinically by progressive jaundice, varices and other signs of cirrhosis.\n(Choice C) A barium swallow might be helpful if a disease of esophageal motility was suspected, such as achalasia or the presence of an esophageal diverticulum.\n(Choice D) A CT scan of the neck may be useful if a mass lesion was suspected in the esophagus or pharynx as a possible cause of difficulty swallowing.\n(Choice E) Esophageal endoscopy with biopsy is used to diagnose Barrett esophagus, which is a metaplasia of esophageal squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium and is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with an episode of acute back pain that seems to be caused by lumbar strain (relation to lifting a heavy object, no radicular signs, and good response to conservative therapy). Proper patient education is very helpful in protecting the back from recurrent injury. The education should emphasize the importance of strengthening the supporting muscles (including abdominal muscles) by regular exercise (choice A), choosing an appropriate sleeping posture (e.g. avoiding sleeping on the stomach) (choice B), and learning proper techniques for bending and lifting objects. Exercises with repetitive twisting and bending should be avoided (choice C). It is important to bend at the knees, not at the waist (choice D). While lifting an object, one should also bend the knees, keeping the back straight; this technique is very useful in preventing strains and back injuries. Warm-up exercises should be done before any sporting activities (choice F)."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Fibromyalgia is a disorder of chronic widespread pain associated with fatigue and poor sleep. It is mostly seen in women aged 20-50 years. The cause is unknown but sleep disorder, depression, and viral infections are considered to contribute. Physical examination reveals trigger points of tenderness. Laboratory studies are normal. They improve with tricyclic antidepressants and exercise.\n(Choice A). Chronic fatigue syndrome although resembles Fibromyalgia, patients mostly complain of extreme fatigue and not body aches. No trigger points can be demonstrated; symptoms should be present for at least 6 months to make the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome.\n(Choice B): Polymyalgia rheumatica presents with pain and stiffness of the shoulder and pelvic girdle. It is usually seen in patients over the age of 50. It is extremely unlikely before the age of 50. It is a diagnosis of exclusion; ESR is usually elevated. They complain of stiffness rather than weakness or pain. There will be no tender points. They can have associated symptoms of fever, weight loss and headache.\n(Choice C). Rheumatoid arthritis presents with prodromal symptoms of malaise, weight loss and vague joint pain and stiffness. There is characteristic symmetrical joint swelling with associated warmth, tenderness, and pain. Usually metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) are involved. Trigger point tenderness is not a feature of rheumatoid arthritis.\n(Choice D) Polymyositis presents with proximal muscle weakness of the upper and lower extremities. Patients complain of difficulty raising from seated position or climbing stairs. Muscle atrophy and contractures are late complications.

    "question": "A 60-year-old male presents to the emergency room with a two-week history of low back pain and low-grade fever. His past medical history is insignificant. He tried several over-the-counter pain medications with little success. His temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 120/76 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals percussion tenderness over the lumbar vertebrae and local paravertebral muscular spasm. Neurological examination shows 2+ deep tendon reflexes and 5/5 muscle power. The straight-leg raising test is negative at 90 degrees. Laboratory values are:\nHemoglobin 12.2 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 10,700/cmm\nSegmented Neutrophils 63%\nBands 4%\nEosinophils 3%\nBasophils 0%\nLymphocytes 23%\nMonocytes 8%\nPlatelets 400,000/cmm\nESR 75 mm/hr\nWhat is the next step in the management of this patient?",

      "C. MRI of the spine",
      "D. Serum rheumatoid factor",
      "E. Physiotherapy"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is suggestive of vertebral osteomyelitis. Vertebral osteomyelitis is usually hematogenous, and the lumbar area is most commonly affected. Back pain accompanied by low-grade fever and elevated ESR is the typical presentation. High-grade fever and chills are uncommon. Physical examination may demonstrate local tenderness on percussion over the affected vertebrae and paravertebral muscular spasm. Early diagnosis is very important in patients with this condition, because epidural abscess and spinal cord compression may develop if the treatment is delayed (Choice E).\nMRI of the spine is the most sensitive test for identification of vertebral osteomyelitis (Choice C). Since MRI is excellent for evaluation of soft tissues, it will also reveal whether there is any abscess or cord compression. Blood cultures are also important in diagnosis, and allow directed antibiotic therapy.\n(Choice A) Plain radiograph would not usually detect bone changes in acute osteomyelitis, but may be employed in chronic osteomyelitis.\n(Choice B) Bone scan has similar sensitivity to MRI in the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis, but has inferior specificity. Furthermore, MRI provides superior information about surrounding soft tissues, allowing evaluation for possible epidural abscess and cord compression.\n(Choice D) Serum rheumatoid factor provides no diagnostic information for the clinical scenario described. Rheumatoid arthritis rarely ever presents with back pain. They usually complain of pain and stiffness over the MCP and PIP joints."

    "question": "A 25-year-old immigrant from Eastern Europe is being evaluated for right shoulder pain and swelling. He also complains of heel pain while walking. Palpation over the heels, iliac crests and tibial tuberosities elicits tenderness. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Positive rheumatoid factor",
      "B. Proteinuria",
      "C. Limited spine mobility",
      "D. Subcutaneous nodules",
      "E. Hand joint deformities"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Enthesitis refers to inflammation and pain at sites where tendons and ligaments attach to bone. Enthesitis is most commonly seen in cases of recurrent tendon or ligament stress and the HLA-B27-associated arthropathies such as AS, psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis. It is particularly prominent in AS and classically manifests with heel pain due to tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. The tibial tuberosities and iliac crests are also common sites of symptomatic enthesitis. Shoulder and hip pain, stiffness, low back pain, and limited spinal mobility, are other common manifestations of AS.\n(Choice A) Ankylosing spondylitis is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, meaning that it tests negative for rheumatoid factor. Furthermore, enthesitis is not a prominent feature of rheumatoid arthritis or of other conditions that test positive for rheumatoid factor.\n(Choice B) Proteinuria and arthritis may be seen in lupus. Lupus is a systemic illness that is likely to present with other findings including weight loss, fatigue, rash, serositis and neurological complaints. Enthesitis is not expected.\n(Choice D) Subcutaneous nodules occur in rheumatoid arthritis and gout. They tend to be painless, slow growing and occur at pressure points such as the olecranon process. This patient's presentation is not suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis.\n(Choice E) Hand joint deformities such as ulnar deviation of the fingers, swan-neck deformities and boutonniere deformities often result from rheumatoid arthritis. AS is not associated with hand joint deformities."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man presents with 24 hours of pain and swelling of his right knee. He also reports having constipation, excessive urination, and fatigue for the past several months. He denies fevers, chills, and trauma to the knee. He does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. His temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), and blood pressure is 130/76 mmHg. Examination shows tenderness, erythema, and swelling of the right knee. His lab values are:\nSerum sodium 138 mEq/L\nSerum potassium 4.0 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nSerum calcium 11.9 mg/dL\nSerum phosphorous 1.9 mg/dL\nBlood glucose 98 mg/dL\nWhich of the following would synovial fluid analysis from the knee most likely reveal?",
    "options": [
      "A. Needle shaped crystals with negative birefringence",
      "B. Coffin lid shaped crystals",
      "C. Rhomboid shaped crystals with positive birefringence",
      "D. Numerous polymorphs filled with gram positive cocci",
      "E. Numerous lymphocytes and budding yeast"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient is suffering from acute arthritis of the right knee in the setting of hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism causes elevated calcium levels and low phosphorus concentrations. As demonstrated by this patient, hypercalcemia may result in constipation, fatigue, and excessive urination. It also causes abdominal pain, urinary stones, mental status changes, and osteoporosis. On top of his symptoms consistent with hyperparathyroidism, this man also complains of a monoarthritis. Patients with hyperparathyroidism are at increased risk of developing pseudogout, a monoarthropathy caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition. Pseudogout commonly presents as an acute onset, painful monoarthropathy affecting the knee. Synovial fluid from patients with pseudogout reveals rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent crystals.\n(Choice A) Needle shaped crystals with negative birefringence are diagnostic of gout. Gout also presents as an acute onset, painful monoarthropathy. However, it most often affects the first metatarsophalangeal joints and it is not associated with hyperparathyroidism.\n(Choice B) Struvite crystals have the shape of coffin lids and are seen in nephrolithiasis caused by chronic urinary tract infection with urease-producing organisms.\n(Choice D) Polymorphonuclear cells filled with gram positive cocci would indicate septic arthritis. While septic arthritis, gout, and pseudogout are hard to definitively distinguish based on clinical presentation alone, this patient's history of hyperparathyroidism and lack of fever make pseudogout more likely than septic arthritis or gout.\n(Choice E) Lymphocytes and budding yeast would indicate fungal arthritis, a rare condition. Fungal arthritis is slowly progressive and most often presents as a monoarthritis of the knee. The acuity of this man's arthritis and his history of hyperparathyroidism make fungal arthritis unlikely."

    "question": "A 24-year-old Caucasian male undergoes pulmonary function testing. The following values are obtained:\nFEV1 80% of predicted\nFEV1/FVC 85%\nFRC 110% of predicted\nHe has no current complaints except for occasional low back pain treated with naproxen. He smokes one pack per day and drinks a six-pack of beer each weekend. His ESR is 47 mm/hr. Which of the following best explains the pulmonary function test findings in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Emphysema",
      "B. Small airway obstruction",
      "C. Pulmonary fibrosis",
      "D. Chest wall motion restriction",
      "E. Pulmonary vascular disease"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The results of pulmonary function testing in this patient indicate that he is experiencing mild restrictive lung disease. Restrictive and obstructive lung diseases both result in decreased FEV1 and FVC values, but the FEV1/FVC ratio in restrictive lung disease is >=80%, whereas in obstructive lung disease it is <80%. Causes of restrictive lung disease include interstitial lung disease, neuromuscular disease, alveolar edema, pleural fibrosis and chest wall abnormalities. This patient's restrictive disease may be the result of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). AS is most common in young HLA-B27 positive males. Clinically, patients with AS experience slowly progressive back pain of insidious onset, spinal fusion, sacroiliitis and enthesopathy. Inflammation also leads to fusion of the costovertebral joints resulting in restriction of chest wall motion. While most restrictive lung diseases present with a decreased FRC, AS presents with a normal or increased FRC due to fixation of the chest wall in an inspiratory position.\n(Choice A) Emphysema is the result of terminal airway destruction. Emphysema in young people most commonly occurs in smokers with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Emphysema is an obstructive lung disease that presents with dyspnea and decreased breath sounds. Low back pain is not associated.\n(Choice B) Small airway obstruction may result from many disease processes including infections, inhalational exposures, asthma and COPD. This patient's PFTs are not consistent with obstruction.\n(Choice C) Pulmonary fibrosis is a form of restrictive lung disease. It can result from systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma, cigarette smoking or medications such as bleomycin. It can also be idiopathic. Patients present with shortness of breath, cough and weight loss. FRC is decreased.\n(Choice E) Pulmonary hypertension may present with exertional dyspnea, angina and signs of right heart failure."

    "question": "A 53-year-old Caucasian man comes to the emergency department at 2 am because of severe pain in his right great toe for the past 2 hours. He complains that the pain began suddenly as a dull, aching pain, and has worsened over time to a severe throbbing pain, not relieved by acetaminophen. His other medical problems include hypertension, diabetes mellitus-type 2, hypercholesterolemia, and peptic ulcer disease. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 5-6 ounces of alcohol daily. He eats a lot of junk food and exercises infrequently. Both his father and mother have diabetes and hypertension. His older brother died of a myocardial infarction 2 years ago. His medications include glyburide, lisinopril, atenolol, simvastatin and famotidine. His temperature is 37.8 C (100 F), blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min and respirations are 16/min. On examination, the right great toe appears markedly swollen, red, and is warm to touch. Aspiration of the joint fluid reveals negatively birefringent needle shaped crystals. Apart from prescribing oral indomethacin, what other intervention would be most important to prevent the development of further attacks?",
    "options": [
      "A. Smoking cessation",
      "B. Alcohol cessation",
      "C. Stopping lisinopril",
      "D. Stopping simvastatin",
      "E. Stopping glyburide",
      "F. Stopping famotidine",
      "G. Regular exercise and a healthy diet"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Accumulation of urate crystals in the synovial fluid causes inflammation of the synovial lining, and precipitates an acute attack of gout. The attacks often occur at night. The most common joint affected is the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Chronic alcoholism is a risk factor for the development of gout. Ethanol is metabolized to lactate, which competes with urate for renal excretion, leading to accumulation of urate in the body. Cessation of alcohol plays an important role in prevention of future attacks, especially in chronic alcoholics. Other measures that should be observed by patients with gout are (1) staying on a low purine diet, and (2) avoiding drugs such as diuretics and pyrazinamide. Treatment of an acute attack is with NSAIDS (drug of choice), colchicine or steroids.\nSmoking cessation (Choice A), regular exercise, and a healthy diet (Choice G) will benefit this patient by preventing coronary artery disease, especially since he has a history of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, along with a strong family history. However, alcohol cessation is still the most important intervention that will help in preventing future attacks of gout in this patient.\nLisinopril, simvastatin, glyburide and famotidine (Choices C, D, E and F) are not associated with gouty attacks."

    "question": "A 54-year-old woman comes to the physician's office complaining of chronic, bilateral knee and hip pain. The pain increases with activity and is relieved by rest. She denies fever, chills or weight loss. The review of systems is unremarkable. She currently weighs 80 kg (180 lb) and is 146 cm (59 in) tall. Her knee joints are tender but there is no warmth, erythema or effusion. X-rays show narrow joint space, subchondral bone cysts, and bony spurs in both knees. Which of the following interventions would provide the greatest long-term benefit to this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Muscle strengthening exercise",
      "B. Non steroidal antiinflammatory agents",
      "C. Weight loss",
      "D. Chondroitin sulfate",
      "E. Acetaminophen with codeine"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). Studies have shown a particularly strong link between obesity and knee OA. Based on a height of 59 inches and a weight of 180 pounds, this patient has a BMI of 36, indicating moderate obesity. Patients with OA typically present with brief morning stiffness (<= 30 minutes) and exertional joint pain. Unlike autoimmune arthritides, systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss are generally absent. Plain films of an osteoarthritic knee reveal a narrowed joint space, osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis or cysts. Obesity is the most readily modifiable risk factor for OA. Weight loss has been shown to slow progression of the OA and improve joint pain and function. Hence, weight loss is the most effective measure in slowing progression of OA.\n(Choice A) As part of an overall physical therapy program, muscle strengthening exercises play an integral role in OA therapy. They reduce pain and improving mobility, but muscle strengthening does not slow the progression of OA.\n(Choice B, D, and E) NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and chondroitin sulfate each play a role in the pharmacotherapy of OA. They provide effective, temporary pain relief but do not slow the progression of OA."

      "B. Syphilis",
      "C. Gonococcemia",
      "D. Meningococcemia",
      "E. Acute HIV infection",
      "F. Acute rheumatic fever"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "image": "",
    "explanation": "This patient has the classic triad of polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and painless vesiculopustular skin lesions for disseminated gonococcal infection. Her complaints of wrist, elbow and ankle pain are consistent with gonococcal polyarthralgias, and her pain elicited along the tendon sheaths suggests tenosynovitis. The lesions shown in the photograph are typical vesiculopustular lesions of disseminated gonococcal infection; they tend to number from two to ten and may be dismissed as furuncles or pimples. Fevers and chills may be present. A history of recent unprotected sex with a new partner is frequently associated with disseminated gonococcal infection, while symptoms of symptomatic venereal disease are most often absent.\n(Choice A) Arthritis and rash are associated with Lyme disease. The rash (erythema migrans) of Lyme disease occurs early on in illness, while arthritis, typically monoarticular knee pain, does not occur until months later. Erythema migrans occurs at the site of a tick bite, and has a \"bulls eye\" appearance. Tenosynovitis is not typical of Lyme disease.\n(Choice B) The skin findings of syphilis include a painless ulcer of the genitalia that occurs in the primary stage of infection, and a maculopapular rash of the palms and soles in the secondary stage.\n(Choice D) Meningococcemia presents with a petechial rash, high fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, stiff neck, and photophobia. This patient specifically denies many of these symptoms. Furthermore, arthritis, tenosynovitis, and the rash in the image are not consistent with meningococcemia.\n(Choice E) The symptoms of acute HIV infection include fever, arthralgias, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous lesions, diarrhea, and weight loss. Her symptoms are more consistent with disseminated gonococcal infection. All patients with disseminated gonococcal infection, however, should undergo HIV screening.\n(Choice F) An episode of pharyngitis typically precedes the onset of acute rheumatic fever by 2-4 weeks. Symptoms of acute rheumatic fever include migratory arthritis of the large joints, erythema marginatum (raised ring-shaped lesions over the trunk and extremities), subcutaneous nodules, carditis, and Sydenham chorea."

The symptoms subside quickly on penicillin therapy. Ten days later, the patient presents again with fever, skin rash and fleeting joint pain in the lower extremities. Physical examination reveals scattered urticaria and palpable lymph nodes in the cervical, axillary and inguinal regions. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current complaints?",
    "options": [
      "A. Rheumatic fever",
      "B. Drug-induced reaction",
      "C. Lymphoproliferative disorder",
      "D. Henoch-Schonlein purpura",
      "E. Infective endocarditis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This young boy's initial presentation is suggestive of an upper respiratory tract infection. The onset of fever, rash and joint pain 10 days after penicillin therapy, however, suggests a separate drug-induced reaction, most likely serum sickness-like reaction. Serum sickness-like reaction is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs one to two weeks after administration of certain drugs, such as penicillin, amoxicillin, TMP-SMX and cefaclor (most classic association). It most commonly occurs in young children following the treatment of viral infections with antibiotic agents. The mechanism of serum sickness-like reaction is not fully understood, but, like true serum sickness, symptoms of fever, urticaria and arthralgias begin one to two weeks after administration of the offending agent. Serum sickness-like reactions are distinct from immediate hypersensitivity reactions, which present with rapid-onset symptoms.\n(Choice A) Rheumatic fever may occur in cases of streptococcal pharyngitis that are not appropriately treated with antibiotics. Patients may present with a combination of polyarthritis, carditis, erythema marginatum rash, subcutaneous nodules and chorea. Treatment with penicillin makes rheumatic fever highly unlikely in this patient.\n(Choice C) Lymphoproliferative disorders such as leukemia may present with symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy and joint pains. Complete blood count, blood smear and bone marrow biopsy are useful in establishing the diagnosis. This patient's history is more suggestive of a drug reaction.\n(Choice D) Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a systemic IgA-mediated vasculitis occurring after viral upper respiratory infection. It presents with arthralgias, purpuric rash of the lower extremities, abdominal pain and renal disease.\n(Choice E) Infective endocarditis may cause fever, bacteremia, heart murmur, Osler nodes (nodules on the fingers and toes), Janeway lesions (erythematous macules), splinter hemorrhages and Roth spots (retinal hemorrhages)."

      "C. Narrowing of joint space and osteophyte formation",
      "D. Normal joint space with soft tissue swelling",
      "E. Calcification of cartilaginous structures"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a noninflammatory arthritis that most commonly affects the hands and weight-bearing joints. Increasing age is the leading risk factor for OA. Patients typically present with mild morning stiffness (<= 30 minutes) and pain that is exacerbated by exercise and relieved by rest. Unlike autoimmune diseases, systemic symptoms are generally absent. Effusions may occur in OA but the joint will remain cool to the touch. Bony crepitus, bony enlargement, and painful or decreased range of motion are also common on exam. Synovial fluid analysis will reveal a white blood cell count of 200-2000/ml (as opposed to 0-200/ml in a normal joint, 2,000-50,000/ml in an inflammatory condition, and >=50,000/ml in septic arthritis). Plain films of an osteoarthritic knee will reveal a narrowed joint space with osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis/cysts.\n(Choice A) Punched out erosions with a rim of cortical bone are the characteristic x-ray finding in gouty arthritis. Gout causes acute joint pain and synovial fluid analysis will demonstrate a white blood cell count of 2,000-50,000/ml and needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals.\n(Choice B) The x-ray findings of periarticular osteopenia and joint margin erosions are classic for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an inflammatory arthritis presenting with morning stiffness (>= 30 minutes) and systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, and weight loss. White blood cell count of 2,000-50,000/ml on synovial fluid analysis is characteristic. Wrists, MCP and PIP joints are commonly involved. The joints will be warm to the touch.\n(Choice D) Normal joint space with soft tissue swelling is seen on radiography in patients with infectious arthritis. Cell count of >=50,000/ml is typical on synovial fluid analysis and the gram stain is often positive.\n(Choice E) Calcification of cartilaginous structures (chondrocalcinosis) is typical of pseudogout, or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition. The typical presentation involves acute swelling, stiffness, and pain of the knee after surgery or medical illness. Synovial fluid analysis demonstrates a cell count of 2,000-50,000/ml with rhomboid, positively birefringent crystals."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man complains of sudden pain and swelling in his left first metatarsophalangeal joint. He is undergoing high dose induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Joint fluid aspiration reveals negative birefringent crystals and elevated white cell count. Which of the following prophylactic measures would most likely have prevented this condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Urine acidification",
      "B. N-acetylcysteine",
      "C. Allopurinol",
      "D. Mesna",
      "E. Adequate hydration"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with a classic case of acute gouty arthritis. Gout results from either overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. In this patient's case, overproduction due to rapid tumor cell lysis is the most likely mechanism. Induction chemotherapy causes rapid tumor destruction, or lysis. This process releases uric acid, a byproduct of DNA, into the circulation and results in an elevated serum uric acid level that can predispose to gout attacks. Acute, monoarticular arthritis affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra) is the most common presentation of a gout attack. Definitive diagnosis is achieved by joint aspiration with demonstration of needle-shaped, negatively birefringent urate crystals and a white blood cell count of 2,000-50,000/mm3. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is often used to prevent gout attacks. It works by decreasing uric acid production.\n(Choice A) Urine acidification is helpful in eliminating amphetamines but not in eliminating uric acid. In fact, urine alkalinization increases uric acid excretion and will decrease uric acid renal stones. Acidification will increase gouty attacks. Additionally, uricosuric drugs (e.g. probenecid) are used to prevent gout attacks and work by increasing urinary excretion of uric acid. There is some risk of inducing uric acid renal stones with probenecid, so allopurinol is the first line agent for prevention of gout during chemotherapy.\n(Choice B) N-acetylcysteine is used as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose and as a nephroprotective agent to prevent radiocontrast-induced nephropathy. However, it has no role in prevention of gout.\n(Choice D) Mesna is used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis caused by certain chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide).\n(Choice E) Hydration is recommended to decrease the risk of developing uric acid kidney stones. In relation to gout, adequate hydration is recommended during probenecid therapy to prevent the formation of uric acid kidney stones. Hydration is not sufficient to treat complications of hyperuricemia from chemotherapy, however, so allopurinol must be used."

Her past medical history is significant only for an appendectomy at the age of 16 years. She has been taking birth control pills for the past two years. She is afebrile with normal weight and height. Examination reveals reduced forward flexion of the lumbar spine and tenderness over the sacroiliac joints. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. HLA-B27 testing",
      "B. ANA and rheumatoid factor levels",
      "C. Bone scan",
      "D. MRI of the spine",
      "E. X-ray of the sacro-iliac joints"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. The highest incidence of AS occurs in the second and third decades of life, and it has a male:female ratio of approximately 2:1. Any young patient presenting with progressive low back pain and spinal stiffness of >=3 months duration should be investigated for this condition. Patients often complain of morning stiffness lasting >=30 minutes, and their back pain typically improves with exercise. Decreased lumbar spinal mobility and tenderness over the sacroiliac joints are common exam findings. Anteroposterior x-ray of the sacroiliac joints is used to confirm the diagnosis in the setting of a suggestive history and physical. Fusion of the sacroiliac joints and/or bamboo spine is diagnostic.\n(Choice A) There is a strong association between HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis. While greater than 90% of patients with AS have HLA-B27, only 5% of patients with HLA-B27 have AS. Therefore, HLA-B27 is not specific for AS and testing for it is not necessary for diagnosis. On the other hand, demonstrating radiographic changes of the lumbar spine is necessary for diagnosis.\n(Choice B) AS belongs to the category of seronegative spondyloarthropathies, so named because patients are negative for rheumatoid factor and ANA.\n(Choice C) Bone scan is not recommended for diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis. It is best for identifying osteomyelitis, suspected fractures, and neoplasms.\n(Choice D) When AS is strongly suspected clinically and lumbar spine x-ray findings are negative or equivocal, MRI is recommended. MRI is highly sensitive and specific for sacroiliitis and may be diagnostic in such cases. However, the effectiveness and lower cost of x-ray make it a logical first step."

However it can be an early symptom of more serious disease processes and rapid identification of the underlying cause may prevent disease-specific morbidity. Recent streptococcal infection is believed to be the most common cause of EN, while other clinically important causes include sarcoidosis, TB, histoplasmosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Sarcoidosis is most common in African-American woman. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in her management would be a chest x-ray. Bilateral hilar adenopathy or interstitial lung disease would be consistent with the diagnosis.\n(Choice A, D, & E) Typically, EN occurs around the time of inflammatory bowel disease exacerbation. This patient has no bowel symptoms and does not need a CT of the abdomen, colonoscopy, or stool cultures.\n(Choice B) HIV is a rare cause of EN. HIV testing is not part of the initial work-up.\n(Choice F) The cause of EN is most often diagnosed by history, physical exam, and symptom-guided work-up. However, skin biopsy is performed in atypical cases.\n(Choice G) The initial work-up of EN is symptom-guided and includes chest x-ray, PPD skin testing, and Antistreptolysin-O (ASO) titer. However, no risk factors for TB are revealed in this patient's history, so a chest x-ray is more pressing than tuberculin skin test."

    "question": "A 60-year-old male presents to your office complaining of right-sided neck pain and numbness over the posterior surface of the forearm. He had several such episodes over the last two years that responded to NSAIDs and physical therapy. Physical examination reveals limited neck rotation and lateral bending. There is decreased pinprick sensation on the posterior aspect of the right forearm, but no muscle weakness is present. Triceps reflex is normal. Which of the following is the most likely finding on the neck radiography of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Reversed lordotic curve",
      "B. Bony spurs",
      "C. Vertebral body osteoporosis",
      "D. Osteolytic lesions",
      "E. Compression fracture"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering from cervical spondylosis. It is estimated that cervical spondylosis affects 10% of people older than 50 years of age. The history of chronic neck pain is typical. Limited neck rotation and lateral bending is due to osteoarthritis and secondary muscle spasm. Sensory deficit is due to osteophyte-induced radiculopathy and isolated sensory abnormalities are associated with good prognosis. Typical radiographic findings include bony spurs and sclerotic facet joints. Interestingly, such 'osteoarthritic’ changes are common in asymptomatic patients older than 50 years of age; therefore, specificity of these findings are low. Other findings during cervical spondylosis may include narrowing of the disk spaces and hypertrophic vertebral bodies (Choice C).\nReversed lordotic curve (Choice A) is characteristic for severe cervical strain. Osteolytic lesions (Choice D) and compression fracture (Choice E) are unlikely in this case."

    "question": "A 66-year-old man comes to the physician's office complaining of progressive lower back pain. Over-the-counter ibuprofen has provided him with moderate relief. The back pain is associated with bilateral leg pain that is precipitated by walking. The pain improves upon lying down or sitting. He has no pain at night, and no problems with bowel and bladder function. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 6 years ago for a 3-vessel coronary artery disease. His medications include aspirin, enalapril, atenolol, and lovastatin. Physical examination shows normal strength, reflexes and sensation in his legs. A straight leg raise test fails to reproduce pain. His femoral, popliteal and pedal pulses are full bilaterally and he has no bruits. Plain films of the lumbosacral spine show degenerative changes of the vertebrae. Ankle brachial index measurement is within normal limits. Which of the following is most likely responsible for his current condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Atherosclerosis",
      "B. Spinal canal narrowing",
      "C. Bulging disc",
      "D. Vertebral metastasis",
      "E. Spinal cord compression",
      "F. Autoimmune arthritis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis, a common cause of combined low back and leg pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis occurs from any condition that narrows the spinal canal and compresses nerve roots. Vertebral degenerative disk disease (DJD) is the most common cause of spinal stenosis. The symptoms of spinal stenosis are posture-dependent. Flexion of the spine causes widening of the spinal canal, while extension causes narrowing of the canal. Therefore, the leg pain of lumbar spinal stenosis is exacerbated by extension of the spine (standing, walking), and improved by flexion (sitting, lying down). This phenomenon is referred to as \"neurogenic claudication.\" Neurogenic claudication is most easily distinguished from the claudication of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) by the presence of normal arterial pulses. The neurologic examination in these patients is most often normal and the straight leg test is negative. Diagnosis is confirmed radiologically with MRI, and treatment may be conservative or surgical (laminectomy).\n(Choice A) Atherosclerosis is responsible for peripheral vascular disease. Like lumbar stenosis, PVD presents with claudication. However, the leg pain of vascular claudication is exertional rather than position-dependent. Furthermore, PVD does not cause associated low back pain. While this patient's history of CABG and his medication regimen suggest that he has atherosclerosis, his normal ankle brachial index and strong pulses make \"neurogenic claudication\" more likely than PVD-induced claudication.\n(Choice C) The pain of a herniated disc worsens with sitting. Patients present with low back pain and sciatica. A positive straight leg test is sensitive for a herniated disc.\n(Choice D) Vertebral metastasis should be suspected in patients with low back pain in conjunction with history of malignancy, weight loss, failure to improve with conservative therapy, and constant dull pain.\n(Choice E) Spinal cord compression presents with back pain, paralysis, hyperreflexia, urinary and fecal incontinence or urinary retention.\n(Choice F) Autoimmune arthritis refers to a broad spectrum of conditions. Of these, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has the most prominent spine involvement. AS presents in young males as low back pain and limited spine mobility. Leg pain is not a prominent complaint. Symptoms of autoimmune arthritis improve with exercise, whereas this patient's symptoms worsen with walking."

    "question": "A 43-year-old Caucasian female has a long history of polyarthritis. She also complains of fatigue, low-grade fever, weakness and recent weight loss. Her current medications are methotrexate, naproxen and ranitidine. Physical examination reveals deformed hand joints and a soft, tender mass palpated in the right popliteal fossa. The latter finding is best explained by:",
    "options": [
      "A. Subcutaneous abscess",
      "B. Inflamed synovium",
      "C. Lymphedema",
      "D. Venous thrombosis",
      "E. Bony growth",
      "F. Bone neoplasia",
      "G. Crystal deposition"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This woman's history of arthritis, deformed hands and systemic symptoms suggests that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methotrexate is taken by patients with RA to slow the natural history of the disease. The tender mass located in this patient's popliteal fossa is most likely a Baker cyst. Baker cysts develop as a result of excessive fluid production by inflamed synovium, as occurs in cases of RA, osteoarthritis and cartilage tears. As the synovial fluid volume expands, excess fluid accumulates in the popliteal bursa. The popliteal bursa bulges beyond its usual size and fills the popliteal fossa producing the tender synovial fluid-filled mass known as a Baker cyst.\n(Choice A) A subcutaneous abscess would be most likely to develop in the setting of folliculitis or an injury to the skin. The area involved would definitely be tender, but would also be indurated, warm to palpation and erythematous.\n(Choice C) Lymphedema results from obstruction of lymphatic drainage, as occurs from lymph node resection or surgical damage to the lymphatic vessels. There is no reason to suspect disruption of this woman's lymphatic drainage system, and the popliteal fossa would be an unusual location for lymphedema.\n(Choice D) This patient does not have obvious risk factors for venous thrombosis. Furthermore, venous thrombosis would lead to swelling of the entire leg distal to the site of the thrombus.\n(Choices E & F) Bony growth or neoplasia would not explain a soft, tender mass in the popliteal fossa.\n(Choice G) Crystal deposition in the knee joint may lead to a painful, red and swollen knee. The swelling would not be restricted to the popliteal fossa."

    "question": "A 30-year-old Caucasian female patient is seen at the rheumatology clinic. She has a 4-year history of rheumatoid arthritis. Over the past year, she has noticed an improvement in her symptoms. Examination of her joints reveals less swelling and erythema than on the previous visit. Laboratory studies show:\nCBC\nHb 10.8g/dL\nHt 32%\nMCV 104 fl\nPlatelet count 226,000/cmm\nLeukocyte count 7,500/cmm\nNeutrophils 65%\nEosinophils 1%\nLymphocytes 28%\nMonocytes 6%\nSerum\nSerum Na 140 mEq/L\nSerum K 3.9 mEq/L\nChloride 100 mEq/L\nBicarbonate 18 mEq/L\nBUN 16 mg/dL\nSerum Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nCalcium 9.8 mg/dL\nBlood Glucose 98 mg/dL\nWhich of the following medications is this patient most likely taking?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hydroxychloroquine",
      "B. Prednisone",
      "C. Cyclosporin",
      "D. Azathioprine",
      "E. Methotrexate"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's laboratory results reveal macrocytic anemia (Hb < 12 g/dl and MCV >= 100), which is one of the adverse effects of methotrexate. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) which works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Hematologic toxicity with macrocytic red blood cells may occur with its usage, and one of the more serious abnormalities is development of pancytopenia. In an attempt to prevent these complications, the American College of Rheumatology recommends routine peripheral blood counts every three months. Other side effects of methotrexate include: nausea, stomatitis, rash, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, alopecia and fever. Methotrexate acts by interfering with the cellular utilization of folic acid, and folate depletion is considered to be the cause of most of these complaints. Some of these reactions can be alleviated or prevented by the addition of supplemental folic acid, without changing the efficacy of MTX.\n(Choice A) Hydroxychloroquine is also a DMARD. Common adverse effects are GI distress, visual disturbances, and hemolysis in G6PD deficiency.\n(Choice B) Prednisone is a glucocorticoid that is often used in rheumatoid arthritis. Prednisone has many side effects such as iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, osteoporosis, adrenocortical atrophy and poor wound healing.\n(Choice C) Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive medication that is most commonly used after transplantation to prevent organ rejection. It predisposes to viral infections and lymphoma, and can be nephrotoxic.\n(Choice D) Azathioprine is associated with pancreatitis, liver toxicity and dose dependent bone marrow suppression."

    "question": "A 35-year-old female presents with a complaint of oral ulcers that are extremely painful. She had a similar presentation three months ago and the ulcers healed without any scarring. Her medical history includes a recent visit to the ophthalmologist with complaints of blurred vision and she is now being treated for anterior uveitis. She has also had recurrent painful ulcers in her genital area for which she has regular follow-up with her gynecologist. On examination, you notice many hyper-pigmented areas over her extremities and few painful, nodular lesions. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Sarcoidosis",
      "B. Reiter's Syndrome",
      "C. Herpes simplex infection",
      "D. Behcet's syndrome",
      "E. Systemic lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "From this vignette, you understand that this patient has been having recurrent oral ulcers, recurrent genital ulcers, anterior uveitis and a skin lesion which most probably is erythema nodosum (painful and nodular with areas of hyperpigmentation suggested by the old, healed nodules). This picture fits the diagnosis of Behcet's syndrome, a multi-systemic inflammatory disease. This syndrome is more common in the Turkish, Asian and Middle Eastern population.\nThe international criteria for diagnosis includes: Recurrent oral ulcers plus two of the following features - recurrent genital ulcers; eye lesions, including anterior uveitis and posterior uveitis; retinal vascularization; skin lesions including erythema nodosum, acneiform nodules and papulopustular lesions; and a positive pathergy test. Some patients have involvement of the gastrointestinal, skeletal and vascular systems. Combined environmental and hereditary factors are assumed to play a role in the pathophysiology of this condition. Corticosteroids offer relief from most of the symptoms but do not protect from progression to dementia or blindness.\n(Choice A) Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the lung. It is more common in African-American women in their third and fourth decades. It presents with cough, dyspnea, non-specific chest pain and skin lesions characteristic of erythema nodosum. It should be suspected in patients with bilateral ankle arthritis and bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest-x ray. Recurrent orogenital ulceration is not a feature of sarcoidosis.\n(Choice B) Reiter's syndrome consists of urethritis, conjunctivitis, mucocutaneous lesions and arthritis. It usually follows dysenteric infection or sexually-transmitted infection. The mucocutaneous lesions may be in the form of stomatitis, balanitis or keratoderma blennorrhagicum.\n(Choice C) Herpes simplex infection presents as recurrent small grouped vesicles over orolabial and genital areas. Erythema nodosum is not seen in herpes infections.\n(Choice E) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a rheumatic disease caused by autoantibodies directed against self-antigens. Malar rash, arthritis, oral ulcers and other systemic involvements characterize it. Its clinical course is significant for spontaneous remissions and recurrences."

      "A. Rheumatoid nodules",
      "B. Gouty arthritis",
      "C. Severe osteoarthritis",
      "D. Bone tumor",
      "E. Severe psoriatic arthritis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient pictured suffers from chronic tophaceous gout. Gout begins with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and subsequently progresses to monoarticular arthritis. The great toe is most commonly the first joint affected; severe swelling and pain in the great toe due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals is referred to as podagra. Uric acid crystals form in the renal tubules and collecting system resulting in nephrolithiasis. In chronic disease, urate crystals may deposit in the soft tissues forming tumors known as tophi as pictured in the question stem. Tophi can ulcerate and drain a chalky material. The differential diagnosis of tophi includes rheumatoid nodules and calcinosis cutis. The patient described is also likely taking hydrochlorothiazide as her \"water pill\" for high blood pressure. Diuretics in general have a hyperuricemic effect resulting from hypovolemia-associated enhancement of uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule.\n(Choice A) Classically, rheumatoid nodules are firm, flesh-colored and nontender. They typically occur over pressure points such as the elbow and extensor surface of the proximal ulna. Almost all these patients will have positive rheumatoid factor levels.\n(Choice C) Severe osteoarthritis can cause Heberden and Bouchard nodes, which are hard, bony nodules over the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints, respectively.\n(Choice D) A bone tumor would not likely be as multifocal and bilateral as the disease pictured.\n(Choice E) Severe psoriatic arthritis typically first affects the distal interphalangeal joints and clinically manifests as a \"sausage digit\" where the digit takes on a swollen fusiform shape with significant hyperemia."

    "explanation": "The patient described in the vignette has typical features of giant cell arteritis. Symptoms include headache, jaw claudication, muscle fatigue, and visual disturbance. On examination, patients have scalp tenderness and a decreased temporal artery pulse. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is generally more than 50 mm/hr.\nAs giant cell arteritis can involve the branches of aorta, an aortic aneurysm is a well-known complication. For this reason, patients should be followed with serial chest x-rays.\n(Choice A) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common form of leukemia in older individuals. The presentation is very insidious. Although the exact etiology is unclear, certain chromosomal abnormalities can predispose individuals to this condition.\n(Choice B) The most common cause of hypothyroidism is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease). Radiation to the thyroid region predisposes to the development of hypothyroidism.\n(Choice D) Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease involving the large intestine. It is more common in Jews, and those with a positive family history.\n(Choice E) Important causes of membranous glomerulonephritis include hepatitis B and C, syphilis, gold, penicillamine, SLE and rheumatoid arthritis.

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "image": "",
    "explanation": "Psoriatic arthritis occurs in 5-30% of patients with psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that results in erythematous plaques with silvery scales; these lesions typically occur on the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees, as well as the scalp and sacral regions. Patients with psoriatic arthritis present with arthritis of the DIP joints, morning stiffness, deformity, dactylitis (\"sausage digit\") and nail involvement (onycholysis, pitting, thickening). The image above shows all of these classic signs. The left index finger demonstrates dactylitis, many of the nails show pitting and onycholysis (separation of nail bed) and the DIP joints are prominently involved. Furthermore, well-demarcated red plaques with silvery scaling - the classic lesions of psoriasis - are seen on the dorsum of each hand.\n(Choice A) Enteropathic arthritis occurs in 10-20% of patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. It most often affects the lower extremities and sacroiliac joints and tends to wax and wane with the symptoms of bowel disease. These patients present with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms and other extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD.\n(Choice B) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) also presents with morning stiffness. The MCP and PIP joints are prominently involved while the DIP joints classically are not. Dactylitis and nail involvement are also not expected in RA.\n(Choice D) Nail changes are not seen with crystalline arthritis (gout and pseudogout). Cutaneous deposits of monosodium urate occur in chronic gout. These lesions, known as tophi, most commonly occur over joints and the helix of the ear and may ulcerate.\n(Choice E) Polyarthritis affecting the ankles and knees sometimes occurs in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis causes protean cutaneous manifestations, the most common of which is erythema nodosum. These patients also complain of cough, chest pain and dyspnea.\n(Choice F) Osteoarthritis often affects the DIP joints. However, the pain of osteoarthritis is worse with activity and improves with rest (the opposite of this patient). Osteoarthritis is noninflammatory and dactylitis should not occur.\n(Choice G) Neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint) most commonly affects the lower limbs. Most cases occur in diabetics, but syphilis and alcoholism are other causes. Peripheral neuropathy is believed to result in decreased proprioception which leads to frequent trauma and eventual destruction of the joint."

    "explanation": "Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent frequently used as an immunosuppressant in systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis and certain cancers. Regarding SLE, cyclophosphamide is reserved for patients with significant renal or central nervous system problems. Unfortunately, cyclophosphamide has many side effects. Serious side effects include acute hemorrhagic cystitis, bladder carcinoma, sterility, and myelosuppression. Hemorrhagic cystitis and bladder cancer are caused by acrolein, a bladder-toxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide. Drinking plenty of fluids, voiding frequently, and taking MESNA are all helpful in preventing these complications.\n(Choice A) Cochlear dysfunction is a side effect of cisplatin and carboplatin, both of which may be used to treat testicular, ovarian and bladder cancer. Aminoglycosides also may cause cochlear dysfunction.\n(Choice B) Ethambutol and hydroxychloroquine have been implicated in causing optic neuritis.\n(Choice D) Toxic causes of peripheral neuropathy include phenytoin, isoniazid, vincristine, heavy metals, and chronic alcoholism.\n(Choice E) Digital vasospasm (Raynaud's phenomenon) may be caused by beta-blockers and ergotamine.\n(Choice F) Amiodarone and lithium are associated with thyroid dysfunction.\n(Choice G) Gout is a side effect of cyclosporine.\n(Choice H) While alcohol abuse and gallstones account for the majority of cases of acute pancreatitis, certain drugs have also been implicated.

    "explanation": "This patient described is most likely suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically ulcerative colitis (UC), given his young age, history of acute-onset bloody diarrhea, anemia and negative stool cultures. IBD typically presents in patients during their second or third decade, and the presenting symptoms of UC often include bloody diarrhea, lower abdominal pain and tenesmus. Common extracolonic manifestations include skin findings, such as erythema nodosum (as described in this patient) and pyoderma gangrenosum, episcleritis, arthritis and cholangitis. p-ANCA is positive in ulcerative colitis. Presentation of arthritis is similar to ankylosing spondylitis.\n(Choice A) Reactive arthritis may follow an infectious diarrhea caused by Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter or C. difficile. Reiter syndrome is characterized by urethritis, conjunctivitis / uveitis, arthritis, malaise and characteristic cutaneous findings (keratoderma blennorrhagica and balanitis circinata).\n(Choice C) Infection with Tropheryma whippeli causes Whipple disease, a protean disease characterized most commonly by chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, weight loss, migratory non-deforming arthritis, lymphadenopathy and a low-grade fever.\n(Choice D) Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease, celiac sprue) is an autoimmune disease characterized by malabsorptive diarrhea. Serologic testing shows anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies.

      "G. Erysipeloid"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with cellulitis, an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The lower extremity is the most common location for cellulitis. This patient has multiple risk factors for developing cellulitis, including obesity and disruption of the cutaneous barrier due to tinea pedis. The disrupted skin barrier creates a portal of entry for bacteria. Red, edematous skin that is hot to the touch is consistent with cellulitis. Fever may or may not be present. Lymphangitis and regional lymphadenopathy are often seen. Streptococcal and staphylococcal infections are the leading causes of cellulitis.\n(Choice B) Arterial thrombosis of the popliteal artery is most often caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture. It most often occurs in older patients and presents with acute pain, pallor, paresthesias, and pulselessness.\n(Choice C) Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) shares many of the same findings as lower extremity cellulitis. Swelling of the calf, low-grade fever, erythema, and warmth may be observed. However, the fever typically does not exceed 38.5°C and patients do not have regional lymphadenopathy.\n(Choice D) Necrotizing fasciitis is an infection of the skin that spreads to the fascia. Skin necrosis, bullae, crepitus, and severe systemic illness commonly occur. The prognosis for necrotizing fasciitis is bleaker than for cellulitis.\n(Choice E) A ruptured Baker's cyst causes pseudothrombophlebitis syndrome. Swelling is seen in the posterior calf, just below the knee. The fluid from the cyst may also leak down the inner leg, resulting in a hematoma over the medial malleolus known as the \"crescent sign.\"\n(Choice F) Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammation of subcutaneous fat cells that results in red, tender, pretibial nodules."

    "question": "A 40-year-old school teacher comes to the physician's office complaining of joint pain. Her symptoms began 10 days ago and consist of pain in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, wrists, knees and ankles, bilaterally. She describes joint stiffness lasting 10 to 15 minutes after a prolonged rest. She denies fever, malaise, weight loss and skin rash. Her past medical history is insignificant. She does not take any medications. On examination, there is no evidence of swelling, redness or tenderness of the involved joints. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is most likely elevated in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Rheumatoid factor",
      "B. Anti-B19 IgM antibody",
      "C. Anti-dsDNA",
      "D. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate",
      "E. Antinuclear antibodies",
      "F. Antistreptolysin (ASO) titer",
      "G. Anti cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP)"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is most likely suffering from viral arthritis secondary to infection with Parvovirus B19. Adults who have frequent contact with children, such as schoolteachers and daycare workers, are at increased risk of parvovirus infection. Whereas parvovirus infection in children presents with a \"slapped cheek\" appearance, skin findings are often absent in adults and the most common finding is arthritis, occurring in 60% of cases. Parvovirus is amongst the most common causes of viral arthritis. Other viral causes include hepatitis, HIV, and rubella. All viral arthritides present with the acute onset of polyarticular and symmetric arthritis. Peripheral joints such as the MCP, PIP, wrist and ankle joints are commonly affected in parvovirus infection. The appearance of joint symptoms in viral arthritis may or may not coincide with other symptoms of viral infection and, unlike other causes of arthritis, the symptoms resolve within 2 months. Parvovirus B19 infection is confirmed by detecting anti-B19 IgM antibodies in the blood. These antibodies develop within 10-15 days of infection and usually remain positive for 1-6 months.\n(Choices A & G) Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies are most often associated with rheumatoid arthritis. This woman's MCP, PIP and wrist involvement are consistent with RA. However, the acute onset of symptoms, morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes, lack of swelling, and absence of systemic symptoms go against a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, symptoms must be present at least 6 weeks to consider rheumatoid arthritis as a diagnosis.\n(Choice C & E) ANA is a highly sensitive test for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while anti-dsDNA is highly specific for the diagnosis. The arthritis of SLE commonly affects the hands. However, SLE is a chronic, multisystem disorder which also causes rash, hematologic abnormalities, renal disease, fever, malaise and weight loss. The short duration of joint pain and absence of other symptoms in this patient makes SLE much less likely.\n(Choice D) Although non-specific, a markedly elevated ESR is characteristic of polymyalgia rheumatica. Polymyalgia rheumatica presents with pain and weakness in proximal joints, such as the shoulders, back, hips, and neck. The ESR is usually normal in viral arthritis.\n(Choice F) ASO titers provide evidence of recent streptococcal infection, and are positive in patients with acute rheumatic fever. Polyarthritis, carditis, chorea, erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules are characteristic. The arthritis of rheumatic fever is migratory in nature and usually affects lower extremity joints first."

    "question": "A 27-year-old African-American woman presents with several complaints. She has had pain and swelling of her hands and wrists for the past few days. She also complains of easy fatigability and frequent mouth ulcers. She has no significant past medical history and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.9°F), blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg, and pulse is 76/min. Examination reveals swollen, tender metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. There are superficial ulcers on her buccal mucosa. X-ray of hands and wrists shows no bony erosions. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.0g/dL\nPlatelets 90,000/mm3\nLeukocyte count 4,500/mm3\nUrinalysis shows 2+ protein and red blood cell casts. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her joint pains?",
    "options": [
      "A. Systemic lupus erythematosus",
      "B. Dermatomyositis",
      "C. Sarcoidosis",
      "D. Neuropathic joint disease",

      "F. Degenerative joint disease",
      "G. Psoriatic arthritis",
      "H. Polymyalgia rheumatica",
      "I. Rheumatoid arthritis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient's presentation is strongly suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Young, African-American women aged 20-40 years are at greatest risk of developing SLE. Fatigue, painless oral ulcers, non-deforming arthritis, and hematologic abnormalities are common findings in SLE. These patients may also present with low-grade fever, weight loss, rash (malar or discoid), serositis, and proteinuria. Arthritis affects 90% of patients with SLE and is often the presenting symptom. Lupus arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), most commonly affects the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, but differs in that it is non-deforming. Hematologic abnormalities may include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.\n(Choice B) Dermatomyositis presents with proximal muscle weakness, rash of the shoulders and back, and scales on the hands. Hematologic abnormalities, arthritis, and oral ulcers are not expected in dermatomyositis.\n(Choice C) Sarcoidosis is most common in young, black females. Cough and erythema nodosum are common findings. Abnormal chest x-ray, hypercalcemia, elevated ACE levels, and non-caseating granulomas on biopsy also point to sarcoidosis.\n(Choice D) Neuropathic joint disease most commonly affects the feet and ankles. Systemic symptoms of fatigue, oral ulcers and hematologic abnormalities are not expected.\n(Choice E) Systemic iron overload is the hallmark of hemochromatosis. It can lead to arthropathy of the MCP joints, bronzed skin, diabetes, hepatomegaly and heart failure.\n(Choice F) Degenerative joint disease, also known as osteoarthritis, often affects the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. X-rays show osteophytes, narrowed joint spaces, and subchondral bone cysts. OA is a non-inflammatory arthritis and is not associated with systemic symptoms.\n(Choice G) Psoriatic arthritis occurs in 5-30% of patients with psoriasis, though it can occur without skin changes. The DIP joints are prominently involved, and dactylitis (\"sausage digit\") is characteristic. Nail pitting and psoriatic plaques are common.\n(Choice H) Polymyalgia rheumatic is characterized by stiffness and pain of the shoulders and pelvic girdle. Systemic symptoms of fever and weight loss are also common. It is strongly associated with giant cell arteritis.\n(Choice I) RA, like SLE, presents with arthritis of the MCP and PIP joints. However, X-ray in RA may show joint space erosions, juxta-articular demineralization, and soft tissue swelling. Furthermore, while RA may present with hematologic abnormalities and fatigue, the oral ulcers and renal disease observed in this case more strongly suggest SLE."

    "question": "A 63-year-old painter presents with pain in his right shoulder for the past few weeks. He experiences pain when he tries to reach for objects and he is unable to lift his arm above his head. He denies trauma to the shoulder, fevers, chills and weight loss. Vital signs are within normal limits. On exam, the physician raises the patient's arm while asking him to relax the shoulder. At 60 degrees, the patient begins to shrug his shoulder and complain of pain. In spite of the pain, his range of motion is normal. A lidocaine injection into the shoulder leads to a significant decrease in pain upon lifting the arm. Which of the following is most likely responsible for his current condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Rotator cuff tear",
      "B. Adhesive capsulitis",
      "C. Rotator cuff impingement",
      "D. Crystal arthritis",
      "E. Bacterial infection",
      "F. Cervical radiculopathy",
      "G. Vascular compression"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Patients with rotator cuff tendonitis complain of shoulder pain aggravated by activities such as reaching or lifting the arm over the head. The condition results from repetitive activity above shoulder height and is most common in middle-aged and older individuals. For this reason, painters are particularly prone to developing rotator cuff tendonitis. Impingement is present in all patients with rotator cuff tendonitis. It is confirmed on physical exam by performing the Neer test (passive motion of the arm above the head). Pain and guarding during the Neer test confirms impingement. To distinguish rotator cuff tendinitis from other forms of rotator cuff pathology, lidocaine is injected into the joint. Improved range of motion and pain relief after the injection corroborates the diagnosis of rotator cuff tendonitis. MRI is used for definitive diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Rotator cuff tear may result from trauma (e.g. falling on an outstretched arm) or as the end result of chronic impingement and tendonitis. Similar to patients with rotator cuff tendinitis, patients often complain of pain upon reaching and lifting the arm over the head. However, weakness of the shoulder is more common in rotator cuff tears, and symptoms do not improve with lidocaine injection.\n(Choice B) Adhesive capsulitis, or frozen shoulder, is an idiopathic condition characterized by pain and contracture. This condition presents with an inability to lift the arm above the head. Even after injection of lidocaine, the arm still cannot be lifted above the head due to fibrosis of the shoulder capsule.\n(Choices D & E) The shoulder is not a common site of crystal or septic arthritis. The knee is more commonly involved in these highly inflammatory conditions. They present with a hot, swollen, tender joint. These conditions are confirmed by synovial fluid analysis.\n(Choice F) Cervical radiculopathy typically presents with pain of the neck and arm. Paresthesias of the arm are present in 80% of patients. Weakness may affect the shoulder, elbow or wrist depending on the cervical root(s) involved. Movement at the neck exacerbates symptoms.\n(Choice G) Vascular compression may occur in thoracic outlet syndrome. This most commonly presents with a combination of numbness, weakness and swelling due to compression of the subclavian vessels and lower trunk of the brachial plexus. A weakened radial pulse and reproduction of symptoms with specific arm movements supports the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 22-year-old Caucasian female comes to your office complaining of difficulty swallowing. She says that solid food sticks in the middle of her chest, and that's why she prefers liquids. She has lost 10 pounds over the last 3 months. She also complains of recent severe heartburn that does not respond well to over-the-counter antacids. On review of systems, she denies cough, shortness of breath and palpitations. She has noticed occasional swelling and pain in her small finger joints. Her fingers turn blue upon cold exposure, and she always wears gloves to keep them warm. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She denies illegal drug use. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. CREST syndrome",
      "B. Esophageal neoplasm",
      "C. Achalasia",
      "D. Diffuse esophageal spasm",
      "E. Rheumatoid arthritis"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "CREST syndrome refers to a constellation of findings including Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasias. The patient described has at least three of these findings. CREST syndrome is a limited form of systemic sclerosis. Calcinosis cutis refers to localized dystrophic deposition of calcium in the skin and manifests as subcutaneous pink-to-white nodules typically on the upper extremities. These may ulcerate and drain a chalky material. Raynaud phenomenon refers to acute bouts of digital ischemia in response to cold and may lead to digital necrosis. The fingers typically progress through white, blue and hyperemic stages. Esophageal dysmotility classically results in complaints of food being \"stuck\" in the esophagus and GERD. Sclerodactyly describes fibrosis of the skin of the fingers distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints resulting in a shiny appearance of the skin and flexion contractures and joint pain. Finally, telangiectasias in CREST manifest as \"mat-like\" patches most commonly on the face and palms.\n(Choice B) An esophageal neoplasm or diverticulum may cause difficulty swallowing but would not explain the other symptoms.\n(Choice C) Achalasia causes a slowly progressive dysphagia first for solids and then for liquids. A barium esophagogram would show the \"bird's beak\" sign in the distal esophagus.\n(Choice D) Diffuse esophageal spasm may cause acute and severe retrosternal chest pain as well as dysphagia due to uncoordinated and / or hypertensive esophageal contractions.\n(Choice E) Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with bilateral, symmetric joint pain that classically first affects the proximal interphalangeal joints. Patients may also have rheumatoid nodules, pulmonary fibrosis and infiltrate, scleritis and, rarely, splenomegaly with neutropenia (Felty syndrome)."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents to her physician's office because of pain in her left knee joint. She reports having mild discomfort and pain in right wrist 4 days ago and left ankle pain two days ago. She denies any recent respiratory illness, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. She has no vaginal discharge. She has no previous medical problems and does not take any medications. She drinks half a pint of vodka daily but denies intravenous drug abuse. She is single and sexually active. Her last menstrual period was one week ago. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 15/min. Examination of the knee reveals warmth, tenderness, decreased range of motion, and an effusion. No skin lesions are present and her pelvic examination is unremarkable. Synovial fluid analysis shows a white blood cell count of 75,000/microL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Non-gonococcal septic arthritis",
      "B. Gonococcal septic arthritis",
      "C. Acute rheumatic fever",
      "D. Acute HIV infection",
      "E. Crystal induced arthritis",
      "F. Infective endocarditis",
      "G. Reactive arthritis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The fever, knee pain, and WBC count of 75,000/microL on synovial fluid analysis strongly suggest septic arthritis. Septic arthritis in a young, sexually active individual is most often caused by Neisseria gonorrhea. Gonococcal septic arthritis may present in one of two ways: as an asymmetric polyarthritis (often associated with tenosynovitis and skin rash) or as an isolated purulent arthritis affecting one or a few joints. In some patients, asymmetric polyarthritis may precede purulent monoarthritis. For this patient, asymmetric polyarthritis of the right wrist and left ankle preceded purulent monoarthritis of the left knee. Although skin rash and tenosynovitis are not seen in this patient, purulent arthritis in a sexually active individual is gonococcal arthritis until proven otherwise. Gram stain of the synovial fluid, blood cultures, and urethral cultures are used to confirm the diagnosis.\n(Choice A) Non-gonococcal septic arthritis is less likely than gonococcal arthritis in a young, sexually active patient. Gram stain and blood cultures are necessary for definitive diagnosis.\n(Choice C) Acute rheumatic fever occurs 2-4 weeks after pharyngitis caused by Group A Streptococcus. Symptoms of acute rheumatic fever include migratory arthritis of the large joints, erythema marginatum rash, subcutaneous nodules, carditis, and Sydenham chorea.\n(Choice D) Symptoms of acute HIV infection tend to present 2-4 weeks after exposure to the virus. The symptoms are non-specific and include fever, arthralgias, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous lesions, diarrhea, and weight loss.\n(Choice E) Crystal-induced arthritis often presents with a warm, painful, swollen joint accompanied by low grade fever. Synovial fluid analysis reveals a WBC count of 10,000-50,000/microL and characteristic crystals under polarized light.\n(Choice F) Arthritis is not a prominent symptom of infective endocarditis. Fever, a new heart murmur, Osler’s nodes (nodules on finger and toe pads), Roth's spots (retinal hemorrhages), and Janeway lesions (small hemorrhages on extremities) are classic.\n(Choice G) Reactive arthritis may be caused by genitourinary infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or by certain gastrointestinal infections. It presents with a triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis."

    "question": "A 45-year-old tennis player comes to your office with a complaint of pain over the lateral side of the right elbow. He has been a professional tennis player for 15 years but has never had this kind of pain before. Range of motion at both elbows is normal. There is point tenderness over the lateral side of the distal end of right humerus. Pain is exacerbated by extension of wrist against resistance. The rest of the physical examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Lateral epicondylitis",
      "B. Rotator cuff injury",
      "C. Radial tunnel syndrome",
      "D. Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment",
      "E. Rupture of long head of biceps tendon"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient described is suffering from lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). Though the condition is termed \"tennis elbow\", lateral epicondylitis can result from a variety of activities that involve repeated forceful wrist extension and supination (backhand in tennis, use of a screwdriver). Patients with lateral epicondylitis present with pain near the lateral epicondyle that is worsened by use. Examination reveals point tenderness just distal to the lateral epicondyle and production of pain during active extension of the wrist. The underlying pathophysiology is degeneration of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon near the lateral epicondyle.\n(Choice B) Rotator cuff injury results in shoulder pain, weakness and decreased range of motion. It is typically the result of impingement of the supraspinatus tendon.\n(Choice C) Radial tunnel syndrome causes signs and symptoms similar to lateral epicondylitis and may occur in conjunction with that condition. The tenderness in radial tunnel syndrome tends to overlie the extensor muscle wad, and pain in this syndrome is elicited on examination by flexing the patient's long finger while the patient actively extends the fingers and wrists.\n(Choice D) Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment results in weakness of the extrinsic extensors of the hand and fingers.\n(Choice E) Rupture of long head of biceps tendon causes pain in the upper arm and shoulder and a prominent bulge in the midportion of the upper arm."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man complains of periodic back pain radiating to his thigh and buttock. The pain is related to walking or climbing the stairs but is promptly relieved by leaning forward. He also has noticed tingling and numbness in both lower extremities. He has a history of hypertension and takes hydrochlorothiazide. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg. Lumbar extension reproduces the pain and tingling, while lumbar flexion relieves the symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Iliac artery atherosclerosis",
      "B. Abdominal aortic aneurysm",
      "C. Degenerative central canal stenosis",
      "D. Lumbar disk herniation",
      "E. Spina bifida occulta",
      "F. Metastatic disease",
      "G. Seronegative spondylarthritis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Lumbar spinal stenosis is a degenerative condition where the spinal canal is narrowed, resulting in compression of one or more of the spinal roots. It most commonly results from a combination of two factors: enlarging osteophytes at the facet joints and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. Most affected patients are over age 60. Patients experience back pain that radiates to the buttocks and thighs. Numbness and paresthesias may occur. Symptoms are typically worse during walking and lumbar extension, while lumbar flexion alleviates the symptoms. Pedal pulses should remain normal, as arterial perfusion is not affected. The diagnosis is confirmed with MRI.\n(Choice A) Iliac artery atherosclerosis causes claudication in the buttocks and thighs. This pain typically occurs during activity as is relieved by rest. The key clinical differences between iliac artery atherosclerosis and lumbar spinal stenosis are that the former is not affected by lumbar extension or flexion and does not cause back pain.\n(Choice B) Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are usually asymptomatic but can present with severe back or abdominal pain and hypotension upon rupture.\n(Choice D) Lumbar disk herniation typically presents with the acute onset of back pain with or without radiation down one leg. Patients usually recall an inciting event. As with lumbar spinal stenosis, the pain may be radiating and be associated with neurologic symptoms. However, in disc herniation, lumbar flexion and sitting will make the pain worse.\n(Choice E) Spina bifida occulta is a congenital defect of the vertebral arch that does not involve protrusion of the cord or dura. It is typically asymptomatic and diagnosed as an incidental radiographic finding.\n(Choice F) Metastatic disease of the vertebrae typically presents as pain that is chronic, dull, worse at night, and changes little with activity. The pain is usually non-radiating.\n(Choice G) Seronegative spondylarthritis (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis) is characterized by progressive limitation of back motion. It most often occurs in young men. Back pain and stiffness are typically worst in the morning and improve as the day progresses."

    "question": "A 51-year-old Caucasian female complains of low-back pain radiating to the buttocks. She also complains of persistent muscle pain that gets worse with exercise. Physical examination reveals normal muscle strength. Her joints are not swollen, but palpation over the outer upper quadrants of the buttocks and the medial aspect of the knees elicits tenderness. Her ESR is 12 mm/hr. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Seronegative spondyloarthropathy",
      "B. Polymyalgia rheumatica",
      "C. Polymyositis",
      "D. Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "E. Fibromyalgia",
      "F. Polyarteritis nodosa",
      "G. Giant cell arteritis"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "The presence of diffuse musculoskeletal pain in the absence of joint swelling, muscle weakness or laboratory abnormalities is suggestive of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is the most common cause of generalized musculoskeletal pain in women ages 20-55. The pathogenesis of fibromyalgia is poorly understood, but it is believed to be a disorder of pain regulation. The diagnosis is made based on the presence of widespread musculoskeletal pain and excessive tenderness on palpation of at least 11 of 18 predefined soft tissue locations during physical examination. These sites include the upper quadrants of the buttocks and medial aspect of the knees (as in this patient), as well as the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The absence of joint swelling or muscle weakness is also characteristic of fibromyalgia, as is the worsening of symptoms with exercise.\n(Choice A) Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SA) do commonly cause low back pain. Although the rheumatoid factor is negative in this patient, an elevated ESR would be expected in any of the SAs. The pain of spondyloarthropathy improves with exercise, unlike that of fibromyalgia.\n(Choice B) Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is most common in women and patients over 50. Patients present with pain and stiffness of the shoulders and pelvic girdle. The ESR is almost always elevated. PMR is commonly associated with temporal arteritis.\n(Choice C) Polymyositis is characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness and mild pain. This patient showed no weakness on exam. Elevation of CK and inflammation of the muscle fibers occurs in polymyositis.\n(Choice D) Risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis include female gender and middle age. Swelling of the wrist and hand joints (MCP and PIP), morning stiffness and an elevated rheumatoid factor and ESR are common."

    "question": "A 35-year-old white female presents with pain and stiffness of her wrist and hand joints for the last several months. Her morning stiffness lasts for more than an hour. She also complains of redness and joint swelling. Her past medical history is significant only for a similar episode one year ago. That episode resolved with over the counter ibuprofen. Examination of her joints shows redness, warmth, swelling and tenderness of proximal interphalangeal joints, metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists. X-ray shows periarticular osteopenia and erosions of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. She started taking indomethacin with good relief. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": [
      "A. Glucocorticoids",
      "B. Methotrexate",
      "C. Celecoxib",
      "D. Azathioprine",
      "E. Etanercept",
      "F. Infliximab",
      "G. No additional treatment"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The above patient is most likely suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The key clinical features of RA include symmetric polyarthritis, characteristic joint deformities (ulnar deviation, swan neck and boutonnière) and morning stiffness lasting longer than one hour. Systemic signs such as fever, weight loss and malaise may also be present. Laboratory testing classically reveals the presence of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide while radiographic studies may reveal joint erosions, juxta-articular osteoporosis and narrowing of the joint spaces. In the hand, the proximal interphalangeal and the metacarpophalangeal joints are most commonly affected.\nOnce the diagnosis of RA is certain, therapy with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is indicated. DMARDs should be used early in the course of the disease as RA is a chronic medical problem and the goal of therapy is induction of a remission followed by maintenance of that remission. The first-line DMARD used in the treatment of RA is methotrexate due to its long history of efficacy and safety when used as a weekly pulse. Other DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, etanercept, infliximab and azathioprine.\n(Choice A) Glucocorticoids offer rapid improvement in the clinical and radiographic findings of RA, but due to their significant adverse effects they are typically not used for long term management.\n(Choice C) Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor and its anti-inflammatory and analgesic action is comparable to conventional NSAIDs. In contrast to conventional NSAIDs, celecoxib does not affect hemostasis and does not produce GI side effects. COX-2 inhibitors are avoided currently due to their ability to cause an increased risk of heart disease.\n(Choice D) Azathioprine is a purine analog that is used as an immunosuppressive and a DMARD. It is not as efficacious as methotrexate, therefore, it is not used as a first-line agent in RA.\n(Choices E & F) Etanercept and infliximab are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. They are very effective in patients who have disease refractory to methotrexate. These agents, however, are very expensive and do not have the long safety record that methotrexate has because they are relatively new. Reports of increased risk of lymphoma, tuberculosis reactivation, CHF and demyelinating disease have been associated with these agents. They are not yet indicated as first-line treatment.\n(Choice G) Leaving this patient untreated is inappropriate as RA is a progressive disease with effective available treatments."

    "question": "A 27-year-old male presents to the physician's office because of pain on the medial side of the tibia just below the knee. The pain does not radiate and is continuous. He relates the onset of his pain to falling on the ground while playing football two weeks ago. He denies fever, malaise and weight loss. His past medical history is not significant. On examination, a well-defined area of tenderness is present on the upper tibia below the medial knee joint. There is no redness, warmth or swelling. His gait is normal. A valgus stress test has no effect on his pain. X-ray of the knee and tibia shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his current symptoms?",
    "options": [
      "A. Anserine bursitis",
      "B. Prepatellar bursitis",
      "C. Medial collateral ligament strain",
      "D. Medial compartment osteoarthritis",
      "E. Patellofemoral syndrome"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely experiencing anserine bursitis. The anserine bursa is located anteromedially over the tibial plateau just below the joint line of the knee. Inflammation of the anserine bursa can be the result of an abnormal gait, overuse or trauma. Patients typically present complaining of localized pain over the anteromedial tibia; the pain is often present overnight as pressure from the knees making contact with one another while the patient lies on their side can exacerbate the pain. Examination reveals a well-defined area of tenderness over the medial tibial plateau just below the joint line. A valgus stress test does not aggravate the pain indicating that disease of the medial collateral ligament is absent. X-ray of the tibia is normal in this condition. Treatment is with rest, ice and maneuvers to reduce pressure on the bursa. Corticosteroid injections into the bursa are also helpful.\n(Choice B) Prepatellar bursitis presents with pain and swelling directly over the patella. Examination shows cystic swelling over the patella with variable signs of inflammation. The most common cause is trauma.\n(Choice C) Medial collateral ligament injury presents with pain along the medial joint line and is aggravated by walking. It is caused by valgus stress applied on the lateral aspect of the knee when it is partially flexed. The knee pain in this condition is aggravated by valgus stress testing.\n(Choice D) Medial compartment osteoarthritis presents with pain of medial joint line typically in patients older than 40. Other clinical features include morning stiffness of less than 30 minutes, crepitus and bony tenderness on examination. X-ray of the knee shows narrowing of the joint space and osteophyte formation. Anserine bursitis may accompany medial compartment osteoarthritis due to the chronic gait abnormality caused by the arthritic pain.\n(Choice E) Patellofemoral syndrome is a common overuse pain syndrome of the knee. Patients present with peripatellar pain worsened by activity or prolonged sitting (due to sustained flexion) and may also complain of crepitus with motion of the patella."

    "question": "A 16-year-old boy presents with a seven month history of intermittent right knee pain and swelling. He states that his discomfort first began after a baseball injury. This injury was associated with pain, swelling, and restriction of movement in his right knee. He has had three subsequent episodes of pain and swelling in his right knee, not precipitated by trauma. The last episode occurred three days ago. He denies history of fevers or chills. There is no history of recent travel, other than a camping trip with his friends to Long Island, New York a few months ago. On physical examination, he has a marked effusion of his right knee and is unable to fully flex or extend his leg. X-ray reveals no bony abnormalities. What is the most probable diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "A. Rheumatoid arthritis",

      "C. Lyme arthritis",
      "D. Reactive arthritis",
      "E. Osteomyelitis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Lyme arthritis occurs as a result of untreated Lyme infection. It is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete carried by the deer ticks. It travels through the blood stream into the various areas of the body, including the joints. The early symptoms are mild and are easily overlooked. Arthritis is the hallmark of late disease. It tends to involve the knee in most patients. Warmth, swelling from effusion and restriction of movements differentiate it from arthralgias, which occur early in the disease process. In this vignette, the patient has a history typical of intermittent inflammatory arthritis. The first episode occurs within six months of having erythema migrans. The episodes gradually disappear in about ten years, if left untreated. In the United States, Lyme disease is prevalent in Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Wisconsin.\n(Choice A) Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise and weight loss. The joints are symmetrically involved. Monoarticular rheumatoid arthritis at this age is very unlikely.\n(Choice B) Septic arthritis presents with sudden onset of acute monoarticular arthritis in a previously damaged joint, associated with chills and fever. The joint involved will be tender and erythematous with a large effusion. It is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It is common in intravenous drug abusers and immunocompromised patients.\n(Choice D) Reactive arthritis occurs two to four weeks after genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection. The onset is acute, with malaise and fever. The joints are symmetrically involved.\n(Choice E) Osteomyelitis usually involves the tibia and fibula. Patients present with localized bone pain, soft tissue swelling and erythema. Sometimes, sinus tracts with purulent drainage can be found on the skin surface."

    "question": "A 75-year-old female comes to the emergency room with acute onset of severe back pain. The pain started while lifting a turkey from the freezer. She had no obvious trauma preceding the pain. She denies weakness or sensory loss in the legs. Her past medical history is significant for temporal arteritis diagnosed several months ago and has been taking prednisone. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 140/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals local tenderness of the lumbar spine area. Bilateral ankle reflex is absent. Knee reflex is 2+ in both legs. Babinski's sign is absent bilaterally. Muscle power is 5/5 in both legs. Bilateral straight-leg raising to 90 degrees does not increase the pain. What is the most probable diagnosis in this patient?",

    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario described is suggestive of a compression fracture of the vertebrae. Acute onset of pain without an obvious trauma is typical. A compression fracture of the vertebrae is a common complication of advanced osteoporosis. This patient is predisposed to osteoporosis, because of age and glucocorticoid therapy (for temporal arteritis). Local tenderness on physical examination is usually present. Bilateral decreased ankle reflex has little clinical significance, because it is usually the result of the normal aging process. Her knee reflex is normal (2/4); the muscle power is 5/5 suggesting no nerve root compression. Absent Babinski sign suggests no upper motor neuron-type lesion.\nLumbago (Choice D) is usually related to physical strain and has less dramatic onset. Usually paravertebral muscle tenderness rather than spinal tenderness is the feature.\nHerniated disk (Choice E) manifests with sciatica-type pain that radiates along the thigh and typically below the knee. Straight-leg raising test will be positive because of the nerve root compression.\nChronic back pain is characteristic for multiple myeloma (Choice A).\nMetastatic or primary tumor (Choice F) is a possibility in this patient, but a compression fracture of the vertebrae due to advanced osteoporosis is more likely with the clinical scenario described.\nNote: Absent ankle reflex can be seen in elderly patients as part of the normal aging process."

    "explanation": "Circulating calcium exists in both free and bound states. Only 45% of circulating calcium is free and\nphysiologically active; this is known as ionized calcium. The remainder is bound to albumin (40%), ather\nproteins, organic anions, and inorganic anions.\nCalcium binds to albumin with a ratio of 0.8 mg/dL of calcium per 1.0 g/dL of albumin. Thus, every reduction\nin albumin by 1.0 gfdL reduces the measured serum calcium concentration by 0.8 ma/dL, though the ionized\ncalcium concentration does not change. For patients with an abnormal serum albumin concentration (as in\nmany with liver disease), a corrected calcium level can be calculated using the formula below. By\nconvention, normal albumin is defined as 4.0 g/dL.\nCorrected Ca’ = 0.8{normal albumin — measured albumin) + measured ga\nThus, this patient's corrected calcium is:\n08(40-25)+ 74 mg/dL = 8.6 mg/dL\nA serum calcium concentration of 8.6 mg/dL is normal. Thus, this patient does not need intervention.\n(Choice A) Intravenous calcium gluconate is an appropriate therapy for patients with hyperkalemia ar\nclinically significant hypocalcemia. This patient has neither.\n(Choice B) Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly recognized as a public health problem in the United States,\nparticularly in the elderly. In patients with hypocalcemia, metabolic bone disease, ar myalgias, itis\nappropriate for the physician to evaluate vitamin D stores by checking the 25(COH)-vitamin D level\n(Choice C) HCTZ is a thiazide diuretic that decreases urinary calcium excretion and increases serum\ncalcium concentration. It is a good choice in diuretic-requiring patients who have hypocalcemia ar recurrent\ncalcium renal stones. tis not as strong of a diuretic as furosemide, however, and will not maintain this\npatient's volume status as well as a loop diuretic.\n(Choice D) Cral calcium and vitamin D supplements are appropriate for patients with hypoparathyroidism,\nhypocalcemia, vitamin D deficiency, or osteopenia. Thus, this patient does not require supplementation.\nEducational Objective:\nA significant percentage of circulating calcium is bound to albumin, but it is only the ionized, or free, form of\ncalcium that is physiologically active.

    "explanation": "Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium value less than 130 mEg/L. It typically results from defects in\nthe total body water balance. The underlying cause can be determined based on assessment of the serum\nosmolarity, extracellular fluid volume status, and urine sodium concentration as follows:\npesrorss) |\nHigh (= 295 mOsm/kg) # Exogenous solutes\n(radiocantrast, mannital)\nNormal (280-295 mOsm/kg) # Pseudohyponatremia\n(hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia, isotonic [V fluids)\nLow (= 280 mOsm/kg) | Hypovaolemic TT\nUng = 10 mEg/L @ Dehydration\n=» Yamiting\na Diarrhea\nUng = 20 mEgiL # Renal salt loss\n=» Mineralocorticoid\ndeficiency\nEuvolemic Uosm = 300 Psychogenic palydipsia\n# Beer potomania\nHypervalemic # CHF\n# Hepatic failure\n# Nephrotic syndrome\nThe serum asmaolarity can be calculated as follows:\nSpm = (2x Na) + (BUN / 2.8) + (Glucose / 18)\nThis patient has a low serum osmolarity (260 mOsm/kg) in the setting of a clinically normal intravascular\nvolume status. The BUN and creatinine are normal with a BUN/Cr ratio less than 20, indicating adequate\nrenal perfusion and function. The initial spot urine sodium is 45 mEg/L, which is inappropriately elevated\nconsidering the patient's hyponatremia (the kidneys should be retaining sodium maximally, giving a urine\nsodium less than 10 mEq/L). We can therefore conclude that this patient has euvolemic hyponatremia due\nto renal sodium losses. Given that the urine osmolarity is increased and greater than the serum osmalarity,\nthe syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the most appropriate diagnosis.\nADH acts on the distal tubule and collecting ducts to increase free water reabsorption from the\nurine. Inappropriate secretion of ADH thus causes hyponatremia. Diagnostic criteria for SIADH include:\n1B ll\nz Mig = a\n3. Uy, = 20 mEq/L\n4. Absence of hypovolemia\n&. Mormal renal, adrenal and thyroid function\n8. No obvious surgical, traumatic or painful stimulus known to activate the neuroendocrine stress\nresponse, including ADH release\n7. Absence of other known causes of hyponatremia\nThis patient meets the first four criteria, and based on the infarmation given, may also meet the last three. In\naddition, when a normal saline fluid bolus is given, the urine sodium excretion appears to increase while the\nserum sodium is relatively unaffected, indicating that the kidneys are continuing to inappropriately excrete\nsodium and retain water under the influence of ADH.\n(Choice B) Psychaogenic palydipsia would result in euvalemic hyponatremia because obligate sodium losses\nin the urine would decrease the plasma sodium concentration as the body attempted to eliminate the excess\nfree water. The urine osmolality would be decreased.\n(Choices C & E) Diuretic overuse, interstitial nephritis and other renal salt-wasting conditions would cause\nhypavalemia, elevations in the BUN and BUN/Cr ratio, and possible isosthenuria (U = 5,4) due to\nimpaired renal concentrating ability.\n(Choice D) Advanced liver disease, particularly cirrhosis, would cause signs of total body water overload\n(ascites, interstitial edema) due to hypoalbuminemia (a result of decreased liver synthetic\nfunction). Widespread edema causes a relative depletion of intravascular volume, which causes the kidneys\nto maximally retain water. In this setting, renal sodium retention would be maximal resulting in a low Uy.\nEducational objective:\nSIADH is characterized by euvolemic hyponatremia, decreased serum osmolarity, elevated urine osmolarity\n(often greater than serum osmolarity), increased urine sodium concentration, and failure to correct with\nnormal saline infusion."

    "explanation": "Gastric outlet obstruction is a rare complication of chronic peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Prepyloric\ninflammation may lead to edema, fibrosis and scarring of the pylorus causing symptoms of early satiety and\nintractable vomiting. Persistent and prolonged vomiting from an obstruction typically results in dehydration\n(volume contraction) and a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. In this case, hypokalemia\nresults both from renal potassium wasting in an effort to retain H+ as well as from hyperaldosteronism\nresulting from volume contraction.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Repeated vomiting causes a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis resulting from vomiting can be separated into two phases: a generation phase and a maintenance phase. Initially, vomiting results in the loss of gastric fluids containing HCl, NaCl and water. The loss of H+ as HCl results in the unbalanced retention of HCO3-. Because of the loss of gastric acidity, there is no stimulus for HCO3- release by the pancreas. The HCO3- is instead retained in the blood leading to a metabolic alkalosis. This is the generation phase. Next, as a result of volume loss in the vomitus, the ECF volume is decreased leading to decreased renal perfusion pressure. The kidneys respond by increasing activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Aldosterone functions to retain water at the expense of H+ and K+ loss in the urine. The action of aldosterone, which causes hypokalemia and a contraction alkalosis, accounts for the maintenance phase of metabolic alkalosis resulting from vomiting. The first step in management of this condition is restoration of the ECF volume with intravenous normal saline and potassium. Volume restoration will decrease activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by restoring proper renal perfusion pressure.\n(Choice A) Ammonium chloride is given in severe forms of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, but this intervention carries greater risk than normal saline infusion due to its potential toxicity in liver failure.\n(Choice B) HCl is rarely used as an emergency therapy to treat severe forms of metabolic alkalosis due to its risk of hemolysis and the availability of better invasive interventions.\n(Choice C) Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic and as such would be contraindicated in a state of volume depletion.\n(Choice E) Patients with electrolyte and acid-base imbalances as well as renal failure will require dialysis to correct their acid-base derangement.\nEducational Objective:\nVolume resuscitation with normal saline will correct contraction alkalosis. Hypokalemia should be treated as well."

    "explanation": "The patient described is the victim of a house fire and has most likely suffered a smoke inhalation injury. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is the most common systemic toxicity seen in smoke inhalation. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity 250 times that of oxygen. Upon inhalation, CO displaces oxygen from hemoglobin thereby decreasing the hemoglobin binding sites available for oxygen and the oxygen content of the blood. Because CO binds so avidly to hemoglobin, it also is able to change the shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Specifically, CO causes a left shift of the curve and a shape change from sigmoid to asymptotic. This change disallows unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin in the tissues. By this twofold mechanism, CO poisoning causes decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues. This results in increased anaerobic metabolism by the tissues leading to increased lactic acid production and development of an anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice A) An increased metabolic rate may cause lactic acidosis if there is insufficient oxygen present in the tissues and anaerobic metabolism ensues. This is commonly seen with post seizure lactic acidosis.\n(Choice C) Reduced oxygen utilization by tissues does occur in CO poisoning because of the ability of CO to bind and inhibit cytochrome aa3, but CO binds to this enzyme with less affinity than oxygen. This is not the primary mechanism for acidosis in this case.\n(Choice D) Impaired excretion of lactic acid as well as other serum acids occurs in renal failure resulting in an anion-gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice E) Increased gut absorption of lactic acid may occur in cases of intestinal blind loop syndrome where excessive production and absorption of D-lactate causes a hypochloremic metabolic acidosis.\nEducational objective:\nLactic acidosis resulting from poor oxygen delivery to the tissues is known as type A lactic acidosis. Causes include CO poisoning and circulatory failure (shock)."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an alkaline pH and a primary increase in the serum bicarbonate level (>= 24 mEq/L). It can be classified into two broad categories, namely chloride-sensitive (hypochloremic, saline-responsive) and chloride-resistant (normochloremic, saline-unresponsive) metabolic alkalosis. Chloride-sensitive metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a urinary chloride level <= 20 mEq/day and signs of volume depletion. The common underlying pathophysiology in all causes of chloride-sensitive metabolic alkalosis involves ECF volume contraction. Volume contraction causes increased mineralocorticoid action, which in turn causes bicarbonate retention, H+ loss and K+ loss. The urinary chloride remains low due to avid renal retention of NaCl and water. Some causes of this condition are thiazide or loop diuretics and loss of gastric secretions, such as with surreptitious vomiting (i.e., purging in bulimia nervosa). This condition can be corrected with saline infusion to restore ECF volume.\n(Choice B) Persistent diarrhea causes a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice C) Chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a urinary chloride level >=20 mEq/day and ECF volume expansion. Some disorders associated with chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis are primary hyperaldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, Gitelman's syndrome, and excessive black licorice ingestion. Chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis is not corrected by saline infusion.\n(Choice D) All forms of renal tubular acidosis cause non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice E) Hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis.\nEducational Objective:\nMetabolic alkalosis can be classified into two broad categories, chloride-sensitive and chloride-resistant, based on urinary chloride levels and ECF volume status. Chloride sensitive metabolic alkalosis is associated with low urinary chloride excretion and volume contraction."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described is most likely suffering from primary adrenal failure (Addison disease) resulting from invasion of the adrenal glands by M. tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a common cause of primary adrenal failure in geographic regions where this organism is endemic. Other granulomatous diseases, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis and sarcoidosis, may cause this condition as well. Addison disease is characterized by decreased cortisol, adrenal sex hormone and aldosterone secretion. Normally, aldosterone acts on the distal tubules of the kidney to increase the reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions. If aldosterone is deficient, the kidney inappropriately loses sodium while retaining excessive potassium and hydrogen ions. This results in a normal anion gap, hyperkalemic, hyponatremic metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice A) Elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis is characteristically seen in the following conditions: ketoacidosis (alcoholic, diabetic, starvation), intoxications (methanol, formaldehyde, salicylate, ethylene glycol, paraldehyde, INH, iron, metformin), tissue hypoxia (ischemia, carbon monoxide, cyanide) and renal failure.\n(Choice C) Metabolic alkalosis occurs with vomiting (most common), hyperaldosteronism and excessive volume contraction (thiazides, loop diuretics).\n(Choice D) Respiratory acidosis is caused by conditions that impair proper ventilation.\n(Choice E) Respiratory alkalosis is caused by conditions resulting in hyperventilation.\nEducational objective:\nAldosterone deficiency, which occurs in Addison disease, causes a non-anion gap, hyperkalemic, hyponatremic metabolic acidosis."

    "explanation": "The spectrum of diseases that can cause hypocalcemia is quite wide. Hypoalbuminemia (Choice D) is a common cause of decreased serum calcium level, but ionized calcium level remains unchanged; therefore, no symptoms of hypocalcemia are usually present. This homeless patient with excessive alcohol consumption is predisposed to malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis. Vitamin D malabsorption causes hypocalcemia accompanied with hypophosphatemia, because 1,25-dihydro cholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D, raises the serum level of both calcium and phosphate. The other cause of concordantly decreased serum calcium and phosphate levels is acute pancreatitis.\nPrimary hypoparathyroidism (Choice B) and pseudohypoparathyroidism (Choice C) cause discordant changes in serum calcium (low) and phosphate levels (high).\nRenal failure (Choice A) causes secondary hyperparathyroidism with depressed serum calcium level and increased serum phosphate level.\nEducational objective:\nHypocalcemia with concordant changes of serum calcium and phosphate levels are usually caused by vitamin D deficiency (e.g. due to malabsorption)."

    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Increased serum calcium and increased/inappropriately 'normal' PTH levels are suspicious for either primary hyperparathyroidism or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). The 24 hour urinary calcium excretion and creatinine clearance can distinguish between these two diagnoses. FHH presents with decreased urinary calcium excretion despite the increased serum calcium. Primary hyperparathyroidism, on the other hand, has an increased 24 hour urinary calcium excretion. FHH is a benign autosomal dominant condition. Parathyroidectomy is not recommended and hypocalciuria typically persists following this procedure.\n(Choices B, C, D and F) Patients with vitamin D intoxication, multiple myeloma, renal cell carcinoma and sarcoidosis may also present with hypercalcemia, but their PTH levels are typically low due to feedback inhibition.\nEducational objective:\nIncreased serum calcium and increased/inappropriately ‘normal’ PTH levels are suspicious for either primary hyperparathyroidism or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with normal or elevated urinary calcium excretion, while FHH presents with decreased calcium excretion."

      "® E. 7.62, 30,30"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This disorder is more common in males and occurs in slightly less than 1% of births. Classically an affected infant will present in the first few weeks of life with persistent nonbilious vomiting following feedings. The loss of acidic gastric fluid via vomiting causes a metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, the loss of large volumes of fluid via vomiting leads to contraction alkalosis due to the action of aldosterone. In order to compensate for the metabolic alkalosis, the respiratory system responds via hypoventilation to create a secondary respiratory acidosis. The patient described is expected to have a primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. This is characterized by a plasma pH greater than 7.45, PaCO2 greater than 40 mm Hg and HCO3- greater than 24 mEq/L.\n(Choice A) Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a pH less than 7.35, and primary increase in PaCO2. Hypoventilation syndromes such as narcotic overdose and neuromuscular diseases cause respiratory acidosis.\n(Choice B) A normal acid base status is characterized by a pH of approximately 7.40, HCO3- of 24 mEq/L (22 – 26 mEq/L) and PaCO2 ranging from 35-45.\n(Choice D) Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a pH greater than 7.45 and a primary decrease in PaCO2.\n(Choice E) Mixed metabolic and respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a pH greater than 7.45, a primary increase in HCO3- and a simultaneous primary decrease in PaCO2. This combination of metabolic and respiratory alkalosis can result in extremes of pH.\nEducational Objective:\nSevere vomiting produces metabolic alkalosis due to the unbalanced loss of hydrogen ions in the gastric fluid. Contraction alkalosis also occurs in this setting due to ECF volume contraction resulting from vomiting. The decrease in ECF volume activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system causing water retention at the expense of hydrogen ion losses."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This woman has a metabolic alkalosis and signs of volume depletion. Given her age, gender, vigorous exercise regimen, and lanugo hair on exam, this is particularly concerning for surreptitious vomiting in a patient with an eating disorder. Metabolic alkalosis can generally be divided into two categories: saline-responsive and saline-resistant. Saline-responsive conditions have a urine chloride concentration <= 20 mEq/L and are due to gastrointestinal proton loss (e.g., vomiting), volume depletion, or diuretic abuse. This patient likely has a saline-responsive metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting and hypovolemia, and her acid-base status will improve with normal saline infusion.\n(Choice A) This patient has hypokalemia and normal serum calcium. Calcium infusion will not be beneficial.\n(Choice C) Sodium bicarbonate will provide some volume resuscitation but will exacerbate her metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice D) Loop diuretics will worsen volume depletion and are strongly discouraged in patients with hypovolemia.\n(Choice E) Hyperventilation will decrease her pCO2 and cause a concurrent respiratory alkalosis that would compound her problem.\n(Choice F) Breathing into a bag increases the amount of inspired CO2 and will increase her pCO2. This will decrease her serum pH somewhat but does not work towards reversing the underlying metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice H) Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that will decrease serum bicarbonate production. This may improve her alkalosis somewhat, however, it is a diuretic that will worsen her volume status and thus may exacerbate her saline-responsive alkalosis. Additionally, acetazolamide causes hypokalemia, an undesirable side effect in this woman who already has a low serum potassium concentration.\nEducational objective:\nSaline-responsive metabolic alkalosis has a urine chloride concentration less than 20 mEq/L and is typically due to conditions that cause hypovolemia or GI proton loss. It is treated with infusions of isotonic saline."

      " D. Diuretic abuse",
      " E. Mineralocorticoid deficiency"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This young woman has orthostatic hypotension, which likely explains her dizziness. In addition, she has abnormalities of her serum and urine electrolytes. Diuretic abuse, a technique sometimes used by individuals desperate for weight loss, can cause hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and dizziness by increasing the elimination of sodium, potassium and water by the kidneys, and would explain this patient's pattern of electrolyte abnormalities (Choice D). This patient's recent break-up was likely the catalyst for this dangerous behavior. Other causes of orthostatic hypotension include anything that decreases intravascular volume or vascular tone. Decreased fluid intake, polyuria, and diarrhea decrease intravascular volume. Decreased vascular tone can be caused by autonomic neuropathy or medications. Commonly implicated medications include anti-hypertensive and psychiatric drugs.\n(Choice A) Low caloric intake causes weight loss secondary to wasting of muscle mass and fat. It could also lead to electrolyte abnormalities, but elevated urine electrolytes would not be expected.\n(Choice B) Self-induced vomiting may lead to low serum sodium and potassium, and the associated loss of fluid can cause orthostatic hypotension. However, urinary sodium will be low as the kidneys try to conserve water by maximally resorbinsodium and water.\n(Choice C) Laxative abuse leads to loss of significant amounts of water from the colon, causing dehydration, orthostatic hypotension, and weight loss. It may also cause electrolyte imbalances. However, this patient is losing electrolytes via her genitourinary system.\n(Choice E) Mineralocorticoid deficiency can lead to wasting of sodium and water, but serum potassium levels are increased in such patients.\nEducational objective:\nDiuretic abuse leads to increased excretion of water and electrolytes by the kidneys. Dehydration, weight loss, orthostatic hypotension as well as hypokalemia and hyponatremia result. Urinary sodium and potassium will be elevated. Patients with eating disorders sometimes abuse diuretics to induce weight loss."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has hyperkalemia due to tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperkalemia is life-threatening, and all physicians should be comfortable treating it. There are three goals of therapy: to normalize cellular electrical activity with calcium, to drive potassium intracellularly, and to decrease the total body potassium content. In general, potassium can be shifted intracellularly more quickly than it can be removed from the body. Of the options listed, insulin and glucose administration is the most rapid-acting, driving potassium intracellularly in 15-30 minutes. (Glucose is given along with insulin to avoid hypoglycemia.) However, intracellular shifts are usually transient, so efforts to decrease the total body potassium must still be made, though this occurs over a longer time frame.\n(Choice A) Hemodialysis is the most definitive way to remove potassium from the body in patients with renal failure. However, it often takes at least 1 hour to set up in a patient who has a dialysis catheter or fistula in place.\n(Choice B) Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate®) is a potassium-binding resin that decreases total body potassium content by catharsis in the gut. Sodium is exchanged for potassium. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate takes at least 1-2 hours to work.\n(Choice C and E) Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes renal potassium excretion. High-dose inhaled B2-agonists (e.g., albuterol) transiently move potassium into cells. Neither is as effective as insulin and glucose at decreasing the serum potassium level, and both usually take longer to exert their effects.\n(Choice F) Normal saline is not a treatment for hyperkalemia.\nEducational Objective:\nHyperkalemia is a medical emergency. Therapy involves three steps: membrane stabilization with calcium, shifting potassium intracellularly, and decreasing the total body potassium content. Insulin/glucose administration is the quickest way to decrease the serum potassium concentration."

      " D. Obstructive sleep apnea",
      " E. Warsening respiratory failure"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation of hypoxia and wheezing in a smoker is most consistent with a COPD exacerbation. The findings of elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema in the presence of clear lungs suggest that pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale has begun to develop. The patient was appropriately started on glucocorticoids and bronchodilators for his COPD exacerbation. Loop diuretics such as furosemide are often used to lower right ventricular filling volumes and reduce peripheral edema. However, these must be used carefully as these patients are prone to develop reduced cardiac output with diuretics. This patient's doubling in creatinine and BUN is likely secondary to prerenal renal failure from a reduction in cardiac output. The patient was mildly acidotic upon admission secondary to a respiratory acidosis with a compensatory elevation in bicarbonate. Now the patient's bicarbonate level has dropped likely secondary to a superimposed metabolic acidosis from uremia, but he has enough preservation of lung function thanks to treatment of his COPD exacerbation to mount a compensatory reduction in pCO2 in order to keep his overall pH at roughly the same level. The development of hypokalemia in this patient is likely secondary to the furosemide.\n(Choice B) Ketoacidosis is unlikely in this patient because the glucose is only minimally elevated. An elevated anion gap is also typically seen in ketoacidosis, but this patient's anion gap [Na - (HCO3 + Cl)] is 139 - (18 + 112) = 9, which is within normal limits (normal = 8-12). Renal failure can result in either a gap or nongap acidosis.\n(Choice C) Glucocorticoids can rarely result in hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but this patient has a metabolic acidosis.\n(Choice D) Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to a chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation due to hypoventilation, and could present with laboratory values similar to those seen in this patient initially, however, it would not provide an explanation for the change in this patient's acid-base status over the course of his hospitalization.\n(Choice E) This patient's pH stayed roughly the same despite a reduction in bicarbonate level secondary to his acute renal failure and development of a metabolic acidosis. This is only possible because his lung function improved to the point where he was able to reduce his pCO2 enough to compensate for the reduction in bicarbonate.\nEducational objective:\nPatients with COPD often have chronic CO2 retention resulting in respiratory acidosis. Diuretics are often used in the treatment of COPD patients who have developed cor pulmonale, but must be used cautiously because these patients are at risk of having a reduction in cardiac output with subsequent development of renal failure."

      " C. Metabalic alkalosis",
      " D. Respiratory acidosis",
      " E. Respiratory alkalosis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Human blood pH is normally maintained at 7.35-7.45 by various mechanisms, the most significant of which are the regulation of CO2, bicarbonate and hydrogen atoms by the lungs and kidneys. A pH of more than 7.45 is considered alkalosis, and a pH of less than 7.35 is considered acidosis. The PCO2 and HCO3- values can then be used to differentiate between a respiratory or metabolic cause of the acid-base disturbance. Sometimes mixed acid-base disorders can exist with a pH that is within the normal range; therefore, it is necessary to study the HCO3- and PCO2 values to properly identify the correct acid-base status. The normal HCO3- is 24 mEq/L, and normal PaCO2 is 40 mm Hg. Any deviation from these normal values is indicative of an acid-base disorder. Metabolic acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in the concentration of HCO3-, whereas respiratory acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in PCO2. A primary rise in PaCO2 (respiratory acidosis) or fall in plasma HCO3- (metabolic acidosis) reduces the pH, whereas a primary fall in PCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) or a rise in plasma HCO3- (metabolic alkalosis) increases the pH. In this case, the patient has a metabolic alkalosis because the pH is greater than 7.45 and there is a primary rise in the plasma HCO3-. The cause of his metabolic alkalosis is vomiting (H+ loss) secondary to NSAID-induced gastritis. The increase in PCO2 is the result of early respiratory compensation for the primary metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice A) A normal acid-base profile is pH 7.4, HCO3- 24 mEq/L, and PCO2 40 mm Hg. As mentioned, the pH can be normal in mixed acid-base disturbances, so examination of all three of these indices is essential.\n(Choice B) Metabolic acidosis is indicated by a pH below 7.35 and an HCO3- below 24 mEq/L. The PCO2 may be decreased by respiratory compensation.\n(Choice D) Respiratory acidosis is indicated by a pH below 7.35 and a PCO2 above 40 mm Hg (CO2 is regarded as an acid). The HCO3- may be increased by renal compensation.\n(Choice E) Respiratory alkalosis is indicated by a pH above 7.35 and a PCO2 below 40 mm Hg. The HCO3- may be decreased by renal compensation.\nEducational Objective:\nThe main causes of metabolic alkalosis include exogenous administration of alkali, removal of acidic gastric secretions due to vomiting or NG tube aspiration, renal hydrogen ion loss due to mineralocorticoid excess, and contraction alkalosis."

      " D. Hyponatremia",
      " E.Hypomagnesemia"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has Cushing's syndrome, a disorder caused by excessive systemic corticosteroid levels. Iatrogenic steroid administration is the most common cause, but Cushing's syndrome can also result from a patient's own overproduction of cortisol. The signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include fatigue, weight gain, easy bruising, central adiposity, proximal muscle weakness, hyperglycemia, osteopenia and osteoporosis, hypertension, acne, cataracts, and susceptibility to infections.\nHypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients with excessive cortisol. It occurs because most corticosteroids have some mineralocorticoid activity and will bind to aldosterone receptors in the kidney, causing renal potassium wasting. If severe, the hypokalemia of Cushing's syndrome can be treated with an aldosterone antagonist like spironolactone.\n(Choice A) Hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia, occurs in patients with Cushing's syndrome.\n(Choice C) Hypercalcemia is an occasional finding in adrenal failure but is not frequently observed in patients with Cushing's syndrome. In fact, corticosteroids are often used to treat hypercalcemia, for example in sarcoid and lymphoma patients.\n(Choice D) Due to the direct effects of corticosteroids on the aldosterone receptor, hypervolemic hypernatremia can occasionally be seen in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Hyponatremia is not observed.\n(Choice E) Hypomagnesemia can be caused by poor nutrition, diuretic use, malabsorption, and alcohol abuse. It is not strongly associated with Cushing's syndrome.\nEducational objective:\nCushing's syndrome is caused by corticosteroid excess. Hypokalemia and hypernatremia are the electrolyte abnormalities most commonly observed."

      " C. Metabolic alkalosis",
      " D. Respiratory alkalosis",
      " E. Respiratory acidosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has an anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is evidenced by his acidic pH (< 7.35) and his severe primary decrease in HCO3- (<= 24 mEq/L). Normally, the anion gap is made up of negatively charged molecules such as protein, citrate, phosphate and sulfate that are normally present in serum. These molecules account for the normal anion gap value of 6 – 12 mEq/L. The AG can be calculated using the following formula:\nAG = Measured cations (positive charge) - Measured anions (negative charge)\nBecause the major cation in the serum is Na+, and the major anions in the serum are Cl- and HCO3-, the formula for plasma AG can be simplified as follows:\nAG = Na+ - (HCO3- + Cl-)\nUsing this formula with the patient's laboratory values, the calculated anion gap is 28 mEq/L, an abnormally elevated value. An increase in the AG indicates the presence of non-chloride-containing acids that contain inorganic (phosphate, sulfate), organic (ketoacids, lactate, uremic organic anions), exogenous (salicylate or ingested toxins with organic acid production) or unidentified anions.\nThe most common causes of anionic gap metabolic acidosis and their corresponding unmeasured anions that compose the anion gap are:\n1. Lactic acidosis (lactate)\n2. Ketoacidosis (beta-hydroxy butyrate, acetoacetic acid)\n3. Methanol / formaldehyde ingestion (formic acid)\n4. Ethylene glycol ingestion (glycolic acid, oxalic acid)\n5. Salicylate poisoning (salicylic, lactic, sulfuric and phosphoric acids)\n6. Uremia (ESRD) (impaired excretion of H+)\nEducational objective:\nThe anion gap (AG) represents the concentration of unmeasured serum anions. In anion gap metabolic acidosis, the anion gap is increased by the abnormal presence of non-chlorinated acids in the serum."

      " D. Opioid medication use",
      " E. Right lower lobe atelectasis"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Upon admission, this patient's acid-base status was borderline acidotic, whereas now he is mildly alkalemic. The most likely intervention to have resulted in this change in acid-base status is administration of a loop diuretic. Volume overload and ascites are common complications in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, and loop diuretics such as furosemide are a frequently used treatment, often in combination with spironolactone. Loop diuretics function by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl carrier in the loop of Henle which results in increased excretion of sodium. Loop diuretics also increase excretion of potassium and can lead to hypokalemia, which explains the drop in this patient's potassium level. This patient's elevation in BUN and creatinine is likely secondary to reduction in circulating blood volume and subsequent mild prerenal renal failure. Loop diuretics result in increased distal solute delivery as well as an increase in aldosterone level which combine to result in increased hydrogen ion excretion leading to metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice A) This patient has likely developed mild acute renal failure as evidenced by his mild increase in BUN and creatinine. However, this is not the best answer as acute renal failure by itself would tend to cause metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Loop diuretic use would explain all of the changes in this patient's laboratory values.\n(Choice B) Bowel ischemia results in a lactic acidosis, but this patient has a metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice D) Opioid medication may result in hypoventilation and subsequent respiratory acidosis. While this can result in a compensatory increase in bicarbonate level, this patient's pH of 7.47 is more consistent with a primary metabolic alkalosis.\n(Choice E) This patient has an elevated pH and elevated bicarbonate, thus the problem must be at least in part a metabolic alkalosis. Atelectasis usually does not result in much change in acid-base status unless severe.\nEducational objective:\nLoop diuretics are frequently administered to cirrhotic patients with volume overload and ascites. Potential side effects include hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and prerenal renal failure."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "During pregnancy, there exists a high serum concentration of progesterone, which has a direct stimulatory effect on the dorsal respiratory group of the medullary respiratory center. By stimulating this central respiratory center, high progesterone concentrations lead to tachypnea and consequent chronic mild respiratory alkalosis. The progesterone concentration increases with increasing gestational age, thereby explaining why chronic respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation is very common in later pregnancy. In this case, as expected, the patient's arterial blood gas is suggestive of a mild compensated respiratory alkalosis with a pH greater than 7.41, a primary decrease in PaCO2 and a compensatory decrease in HCO3-.\n(Choice A) Anemia in pregnancy is defined as a hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL in the first and third trimesters and less than 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester. If anemia were causing an acid-base disturbance, it would be an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to poor tissue perfusion and lactic acidosis.\n(Choice C) Obesity causes chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation due to hypoventilation.\n(Choice B) A complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is pulmonary embolus (PE), which leads to tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. In this patient, DVT with PE is unlikely because she has a normal physical examination and normal PaO2 level.\n(Choice E) Hyperemesis gravidarum is a complication of early pregnancy (not late pregnancy), and its consequence is hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.\nEducational Objective:\nPregnancy causes a physiological chronic compensated respiratory alkalosis due to the stimulatory effect of progesterone on the medullary respiratory center."

      " D. Decreased anion gap",
      " E. Alveolar diffusion block",
      " F. Hypercarbia"
    ],
    "answer": "F",
    "explanation": "This patient's low blood pH (7.15) and low serum bicarbonate (18 mEq/L) indicate a metabolic acidosis. Without being given the chloride concentration and urine electrolytes, we cannot calculate the serum anion gap, but despite this, it is most likely that the acidosis is due to the patient's acute renal failure (ARF). Metabolic acidosis due to ARF results from the kidneys’ failure to excrete acids generated during normal protein metabolism, namely inorganic phosphates and sulfates. The cause of ARF in this patient is most likely ischemia resulting from hypotension during her gastrointestinal bleeding. In normal respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis, the pCO2 decreases as the HCO3 decreases. The expected decrease in pCO2 can be calculated using Winter's formula:\npCO2 = 1.5[HCO3-] + 8\nThus, given her degree of metabolic acidosis, the patient would be expected to hyperventilate until her pCO2 approached 35 mmHg. In this patient, metabolic acidosis is complicated by respiratory acidosis resulting in hypercarbia (pCO2 of 80 mmHg) which is the most likely cause of this patient's confusion.\n(Choice A) Defective tubular bicarbonate reabsorption is the defect seen in type II renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Type II RTA is oftentimes inherited, and may be a component of Fanconi syndrome. Type II RTA can also occur with use of drugs like carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.\n(Choice B) Low tubular ammonium production is a component of type I RTA. The primary defect in type I RTA is failure to secrete sufficient H+ in the urine. Without sufficient hydrogen ions in the tubular fluid, ammonium cannot be produced.\n(Choice C) Renal tubular epithelial cells exchange chloride for bicarbonate. Thus, when the urine chloride is increased, bicarbonate resorption into the plasma is increased and urinary excretion of H+ is increased. In this patient, renal chloride and acid excretion are inadequate relative to her body's rate of acid production.\n(Choice D) Decreased anion gap metabolic acidosis may be caused by plasma cell dyscrasias and other paraproteinemias as well as lithium intoxication. Because this patient's acidosis is most likely due to acute renal insufficiency, her anion gap should be normal or somewhat elevated, not decreased.\n(Choice E) A decrease in alveolar diffusing capacity could cause hypoxia and tachypnea. Tachypnea would cause further lowering of the pCO2 because CO2 is more readily diffusible than O2.\nEducational objective:\nNormally, tachypnea is the mode of respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis, as it allows for increased CO2 losses in exhaled air."

    "explanation": "This patient has primary adrenal failure, or Addison's disease. The signs and symptoms of chronic adrenal failure are somewhat nonspecific. Anorexia and fatigue occur in close to 100% of patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea or constipation occur in up to 90% of patients. Other signs include weight loss, hyperpigmentation, decreased blood pressure, and vitiligo.\nHyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in adrenal insufficiency, affecting up to 90% of patients. It is the result of volume contraction (due to mineralocorticoid deficiency) and increased vasopressin secretion (due to lack of cortisol suppression).

However, it can cause significant potassium release and life-threatening arrhythmias, and so should not be used in patients with or at high risk for hyperkalemia. This includes patients with crush or burn injuries more than 8 hours old (high risk of rhabdomyolysis), patients with demyelinating syndromes like Guillain-Barré, and patients with tumor lysis syndrome.

To correctly identify his acid-base status, the best next step is calculation of the anion gap (AG). The AG represents the unmeasured anions in the body. It can be calculated with the following formula:\nAG = Na+ - (HCO3- + Cl-)\nThe normal AG is between 6 and 12 mEq/L. An increase in the AG indicates the presence of non-chloride acids that contain inorganic, organic, exogenous or unidentified anions. Finding an increased anion gap clinically narrows the differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis to a few common causes. Some of the most common causes of anionic gap metabolic acidosis are:\n1. Lactic acidosis: Hypoxia, poor tissue perfusion, mitochondrial dysfunction\n2. Ketoacidosis: Type I diabetes, starvation or alcoholism\n3. Methanol ingestion: Formic acid accumulation\n4. Ethylene glycol ingestion: Glycolic and oxalic acid accumulation\n5. Salicylate poisoning: Causes concomitant respiratory alkalosis\n6. Uremia (ESRD): Failure to excrete H+ as NH4+\n(Choice B) The osmolar gap should be calculated in selected cases of increased anion gap acidosis, such as when ethanol, methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity is suspected. It is calculated by determining the difference between the measured and calculated serum osmolality.\n(Choice C) The urine anion gap is calculated when there is a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. The urine anion gap helps determine if such acidosis is due to the renal or intestinal bicarbonate losses. Renal losses of bicarbonate occur in renal tubular acidosis or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use. Gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate occurs classically in diarrhea.\n(Choice D) Calculation of the urine osmolar gap will not help determine the acid-base status of this patient.\n(Choice E) A venous blood gas should differ little from an arterial blood gas except for the decrease in O2 levels seen in venous blood compared to arterial blood. Venous blood that contains a similar oxygen content as arterial blood may indicate a disorder of respiratory metabolism such as cyanide poisoning.\nEducational Objective:\nThe anion gap must always be calculated in patients with metabolic acidosis in order to narrow the differential diagnosis."

    "question": "A 56-year-old male comes to the emergency room because of a 2-day history of fever, chills, shortness of\nbreath and productive cough. He also threw up ance in the emergency room. He has been smoking for\nseveral years and occasionally drinks alcohol. On admission, his BP was 90/60, but with ane liter of normal\nsaline it improved to 120/80 mm Hg. His temperature is 38.8C (102F). His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis\nis as follows:\nBlood pH     753\nPa02         70 mmHg\nPaCO2       30 mmHg\nHCO3-        22 mEg/L\nWhich of the following best describes his primary acid-base status?",
    "options": [
      " A. Respiratory acidosis",
      " B. Respiratory alkalosis",
      " C. Metabolic acidosis",
      " D. Metabolic alkalosis",
      " E. Narmal acid base status"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Human blood pH is normally maintained at 7.35-7.45. HCO3- is normally 24 mEq/L, and PaCO2 is normally 40 mm Hg. Any deviation from these normal values is indicative of an acid-base disorder. Metabolic acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in the concentration of HCO3-, whereas respiratory acid-base disorders are due to a primary change in PCO2. A primary rise in PaCO2 (respiratory acidosis) or fall in plasma HCO3- (metabolic acidosis) reduces the pH, whereas a primary fall in PCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) or a rise in plasma HCO3- (metabolic alkalosis) increases the pH. In this case, the patient has a respiratory alkalosis because his pH is greater than 7.45 and he has a primary decrease in his PaCO2. He is suffering from pneumonia, which has caused tachypnea due to hypoxia. Hyperventilation results in CO2 loss and a consequent decrease in PaCO2. Because CO2 is an acid, CO2 loss causes alkalosis. The slightly decreased bicarbonate level is due to early renal compensation.\n(Choice A) Respiratory acidosis is most commonly caused by respiratory suppression. Potential causes include narcotic overdose, neurologic diseases causing airway muscle weakness and COPD.\n(Choice C) Classic causes of metabolic acidosis can be recalled using the mnemonic MUDPILES (anion-gap). Methanol, Uremia (renal failure), DKA, Paraldehyde, INH, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, Salicylates. Diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis are other causes (non-anion gap).\n(Choice D) Metabolic alkalosis is most commonly caused by vomiting. Hyperaldosteronism and volume contraction are other causes.\nEducational Objective:\nRespiratory alkalosis is characterized by an increased pH and a primary decrease in the PaCO2. Typical causes include hyperventilation due to pneumonia, high altitude or salicylate intoxication."

    "question": "A 22-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of fever, nausea, vomiting, and right\nlower quadrant pain. He has no significant medical history and does not take any medications. He is a seniar\nin college and denies cigarette smoking or drug use. He drinks alcohol occasionally. Physical examination\nreveals a temperature of 38 68°C, with all other vital signs within normal limits. A CT scan of his abdomen\nconfirms acute appendicitis. Laboratory analyses reveal a leukocytosis but no electrolyte abnormalities. He\nis taken to the operating raom and undergoes a successful laparoscopic appendectomy. Following the\nprocedure, he is given intravenous fluids containing 5% dextrose in a 0.45% (¥: normal) saline solution at a\nrate af 150 mlfhr. The next morning the patient feels well but he then becomes progressively confused\nthroughout the afternoon. You are called to his bedside after he has two grand mal seizures lasting 30\nseconds apiece. Serum chemistries drawn at that time reveal a sodium concentration of 115 mEg/L.

    "options": [
      " A. Fosphenytoin",
      " B. 3% saline",
      " C. MNormal saline",
      " DO. Phenabarbital",
      " E. Lorazepam"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient developed symptomatic hyponatremia over 24 hours due to the inappropriate administration of D51/2NS. This medical emergency requires prompt correction of the serum sodium concentration with 3% saline solution.\nHyponatremia causes brain swelling. When hyponatremia develops slowly, cells in the brain compensate by extruding osmolytes (e.g., Na+, K+) and intracellular water, thus reducing the cerebral edema. However, in rapidly developing hyponatremia, as in patients receiving hypoosmolar IV fluids, there is not time for cells to adjust to the lower serum osmolality, and symptoms develop quickly.\nIn patients with chronic hyponatremia, the sodium deficit must be corrected slowly. Increases in the serum sodium concentration by more than 0.5 mEq/L/h in these patients raise the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. In patients with acute hyponatremia, however, the brain has not yet lost volume to accommodate the new serum concentration and, therefore, the correction can happen much more rapidly. Thus, this patient with acute, symptomatic hyponatremia should receive hypertonic saline until his symptoms resolve.\n(Choice A) Fosphenytoin may decrease seizure activity in this patient but will not fix the underlying cause of his seizures.\n(Choice C) Normal saline is an appropriate therapy for patients with mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic hypovolemic hyponatremia. In a patient with severe, acute, symptomatic hyponatremia, however, hypertonic saline will work more quickly.\n(Choice D) Phenobarbital is a third-line agent for the treatment of status epilepticus. It is typically used only after benzodiazepines and phenytoin have failed.\n(Choice E) Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines are the initial treatment of choice for active seizures. If this patient were in status epilepticus, lorazepam administration would be reasonable. However, to address the underlying problem, hypertonic saline must still be given.\nEducational objective:\nAcute, symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring a prompt increase in the serum sodium concentration. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia requires slow correction of the serum sodium concentration because the cells of the brain have adjusted to the hyponatremic milieu and rapid increases in the serum sodium can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome."

    "question": "A T1-year-old man with inclusion body myositis is brought to the emergency department from his nursing\nhome after becoming less interactive. His temperature is 371°C, blood pressure is 90/60, heart rate is\n98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. He has orthostatic vital signs.

      " A. Oral free water",
      " B. IV 0.9% saline",
      " C. IV 5% dextrase in water",
      " D. IV 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline",
      " E. IV free water",
      " F. IV colloid solution"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hypernatremia reflects a water deficit in relation to sodium, and occurs when there is increased hypotonic fluid loss and decreased access to free water. It most often occurs in people who are debilitated or have altered levels of consciousness and cannot access free water.\nInclusion body myositis is a condition involving adult-onset distal muscular weakness and atrophy. Majority of patients may also present with dysphagia. In the above vignette, the patient's medical condition/disability has most likely resulted in poor free water intake, thereby causing severe hypovolemic hypernatremia (mental status changes, severe volume depletion).\nThe initial treatment for severe hypovolemic hypernatremia is isotonic 0.9% saline, which acts to gradually correct the hyperosmolality while normalizing the patient's volume status. Isotonic saline is usually hypoosmolar in comparison to the hypernatremic plasma. Once the volume deficit has been restored, such patients are then switched to half-normal (0.45%) saline in order to better replace the free water deficit. The goal rate of plasma sodium correction is no more than 1 mEq/L/h. A greater rate of correction may result in cerebral edema.\nPatients with less severe hypovolemic hypernatremia are initially treated with 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline.\n(Choice A) Oral free water is reasonable therapy for otherwise well-functioning patients who have been free water depleted (e.g., euvolemic and hypervolemic hypernatremia). Free water will not restore this patient's volume status, and should not be used.\n(Choice C) 5% dextrose in water (D5W) is the treatment of choice for patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hypernatremia.\n(Choice D) 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline is the treatment of choice for mild hypovolemic hypernatremia.\n(Choice E) IV free water may cause red blood cell lysis due to osmotic shock when given to patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hypernatremia; therefore, 5% dextrose should be used instead.\n(Choice F) Colloid solutions are effective in correcting hypovolemia; however, these are not more successful, and are significantly more expensive, than normal saline. For these reasons, colloid solutions are not recommended as the first-line therapy for hypovolemia.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most common cause of hypernatremia is hypovolemia. Mild cases can be treated with 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline. Severe cases should be initially treated with 0.9% saline."

    "options": [
      " A. Gastrointestinal loss",
      " B. Bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidney",
      " C. Metabolic alkalosis",
      " D. Intracellular shift",
      " E. Volume depletion",
      " F. Hypokalemia"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The chemistry values obtained for this patient demonstrate hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and an elevated bicarbonate level. These findings are all consistent with gastrointestinal losses due to vomiting (Choice A). Gastrointestinal fluid is rich in both hydrogen chloride and potassium chloride. Therefore, any process by which excessive gastric contents are lost (vomiting, nasogastric suctioning), may result in loss of hydrogen, chloride, and potassium ions. The results include hypochloremia and hypokalemia, as seen in this patient. Furthermore, the loss of hydrogen ions increases the concentration of bicarbonate. An arterial blood gas would be expected to confirm metabolic alkalosis in this patient by demonstrating a pH > 7.4 and in addition to the elevated bicarbonate.\n(Choice B & E) For each hydrogen chloride ion lost due to vomiting, a bicarbonate ion is produced. In addition, the volume contraction caused by vomiting leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin system which stimulates bicarbonate reabsorption. It is important to realize that while volume contraction and bicarbonate reabsorption are increased in this patient, they are the result of hydrogen chloride loss; not the cause of it. These answer choices reverse cause and effect.\n(Choice C) This answer choice again reverses cause and effect. In this patient, vomiting has caused significant loss of hydrogen chloride, resulting in metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis is the consequence—not the cause—of vomiting.\n(Choice D & F) Hypokalemia accompanies, but does not cause this patient's hypochloremia. It is the result of gastrointestinal loss of potassium, the intracellular shift of potassium caused by alkalosis, and increased renal excretion of potassium caused by aldosterone. The aldosterone is ramped up by the renin-angiotensin system as a means to retain fluid.\nEducational objective:\nGastric contents are rich in hydrogen, chloride, and potassium. Therefore vomiting causes hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia. Bicarbonate levels rise as a result of hydrogen loss and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. The administration of isotonic sodium chloride and potassium is used to reverse these electrolyte abnormalities."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has hyperkalemia (K+ = 5.0 mEq/L). The earliest symptom of hyperkalemia is weakness. Severe hyperkalemia may cause flaccid paralysis, respiratory insufficiency and cardiac toxicity, which may precipitate a sine wave on ECG and ventricular fibrillation. One of the most common causes of hyperkalemia is medications. After addressing the hyperkalemia with a K+ binding resin such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, it is best to obtain a complete medical history and review all of the patient's medications. Commonly used drugs that may precipitate hyperkalemia include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and spironolactone, all of which may cause hyperkalemia by blocking aldosterone synthesis or action. Other medications that may cause hyperkalemia include trimethoprim and pentamidine.\n(Choice B) Renin and aldosterone levels may be measured to rule out adrenal insufficiency, but it is not the best next step in the management of this patient.\n(Choice C and D) There is no reason to check other causes of muscle weakness in this patient as hyperkalemia is the most likely cause.\n(Choice E) Prednisone is helpful for inflammatory myopathies, but this patient's weakness is most likely due to hyperkalemia. Indiscriminate use of prednisone is not indicated due to its various adverse effects including GERD, osteoporosis, diabetogenesis and weight gain among others.\nEducational Objective:\nOne of the most common causes of hyperkalemia is medications such as ACE inhibitors, spironolactone and trimethoprim."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a leading cause of euvolemic hypernatremia. It typically presents with severe polyuria and mild hypernatremia. It can be divided into two types based on urine osmolality, as well as etiology.\nBased on urine osmolality, DI may be complete or partial.\n1. Complete DI - the urine osmolality is less than 300 mOsm/kg (often less than 100 mOsm/kg)\n2. Partial DI - urine osmolality ranges from 300-600 mOsm/kg.\nThe serum osmolality is elevated in both types.\nBased on etiology, DI may be central or nephrogenic.\n1. Central DI is due to decreased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Common causes include trauma, hemorrhage, infection, and tumors.\n2. Nephrogenic DI results from renal ADH resistance. Common causes include hypercalcemia, severe hypokalemia, tubulointerstitial renal disease, and medications. The most commonly implicated medications are lithium, demeclocycline, foscarnet, cidofovir, and amphotericin.\nIn this vignette, the patient's clinical history, presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus most likely caused by lithium, which is one of the first-line drugs for bipolar disorder.\n(Choice A) Dehydration is the hallmark of hypovolemic hypernatremia. Furthermore, patients with this condition have increased urine osmolality.\n(Choice C) Divalproic acid is a mood stabilizer that is also used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and weight gain. It is not associated with DI.\n(Choice D) Craniopharyngiomas are relatively rare tumors of the sella and suprasellar space. These may cause central DI. The typical presentation includes headaches, focal neurologic changes, or visual problems; which this patient does not have.\n(Choice E) Head trauma is another cause of central DI. This is an unlikely cause of the patient's condition, as there is no mention of any head trauma in the history, nor is there any external evidence of trauma on physical examination.\n(Choice F) Psychogenic polydipsia results from excessive free water intake by patients who usually have an associated psychiatric condition. Although DI and psychogenic polydipsia both present with euvolemia and polyuria; patients with the former are hypernatremic, whereas those with the latter are hyponatremic.\nEducational objective:\nLithium is a common cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI is treated with salt restriction and discontinuation of lithium."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Hypocalcemia is the most probable diagnosis in this patient. Hypocalcemia can occur during or immediately after surgery in patients requiring multiple blood transfusions. Usually, hypocalcemia results from volume expansion and hypoalbuminemia and is therefore asymptomatic because the ionized calcium is typically normal in that scenario. When the ionized calcium is also decreased (e.g., due to citrate binding), symptoms such as hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, muscle cramps and, rarely, convulsions may occur. Severe hypomagnesemia may mimic hypocalcemia because it causes decreased PTH secretion and decreased peripheral responsiveness to PTH.\n(Choice A) Hypokalemia causes muscle weakness and cramps. Symptoms may progress to flaccid paralysis if hypokalemia is severe. The EKG shows U waves in severe hypokalemia.\n(Choice B) Hyperkalemia typically results in muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, and ECG changes. Asystole may occur with severe hyperkalemia.\n(Choice C) Hyponatremia is typically asymptomatic. Prolonged significant hyponatremia may cause weakness, lethargy, delirium and seizures.\n(Choice E) Mild hypermagnesemia results in decreased deep tendon reflexes. Severe hypermagnesemia causes loss of deep tendon reflexes, muscle paralysis, apnea and cardiac arrest.\nEducational objective:\nHypocalcemia can occur during or immediately after surgery in patients undergoing major surgery and requiring extensive transfusions. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes may be the initial manifestation."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has an anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is supported by his decreased bicarbonate concentration and his increased anion gap (140-(103+14) = 23, NL = 6 – 12 mEq/L). His past medical history is significant for severe atherosclerotic disease and atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation. Given this history and the patient's clinical presentation with acute abdominal pain and nausea accompanied by hypoactive bowel sounds and abdominal tenderness on physical examination, bowel ischemia is the most likely diagnosis. Bowel ischemia is a common cause of lactic acidosis in patients with atherosclerotic disease and atrial fibrillation. Lactic acidosis in this scenario results from the production of lactate as an end product of anaerobic metabolism in the ischemic tissue. The accumulation of lactate in the serum accounts for the anion gap.\n(Choice A) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can cause anion gap acidosis and present with acute nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain and tenderness. The patient's glucose is not consistent with DKA which usually occurs in the setting of glucose levels in the range of 250 to 600 mg/dL. DKA can, however, rarely occur with lower glucose levels. Additionally, DKA is uncommon in type 2 diabetics who usually experience hyperosmolar coma with severe hyperglycemia.\n(Choice C) The upper limit of normal for amylase is 65 U/L. Elevations in the serum amylase may indicate pancreatitis, but a false positive amylase can be seen with many conditions. The patient is not an alcoholic and has had a cholecystectomy, so pancreatitis is unlikely. In this case, bowel necrosis is most likely causing the drastic increase in the serum amylase.\n(Choices D and E) Acute appendicitis and peptic ulcer perforation usually do not cause severe acidosis unless the patient becomes hypotensive.\nEducational Objective:\nUnrecognized bowel ischemia is one of the common causes of lactic acidosis in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease or atrial fibrillation."

    "explanation": "This patient has hyperkalemia with significant EKG changes (QRS prolongation with peaked T waves). Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, but can cause muscle weakness. Flaccid paralysis can develop in severe cases. Severe hyperkalemia can cause life-threatening arrhythmias, and therefore requires urgent treatment.\nTherapy includes emergent administration of IV calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane. The next step is to lower serum potassium by driving potassium intracellularly. Finally, the excess potassium should be eliminated it from the body. Agents used to shift potassium intracellularly include insulin and glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and beta-2 agonists. Albuterol, a selective beta-2 agonist, is widely used for this purpose. Therefore, stimulating beta-2-adrenoreceptors (Choice C) is the correct answer.\nThis patient's hyperkalemia is most likely the result of chronic renal insufficiency and enalapril.\n(Choice A) Alpha-1 agonists, like phenylephrine, cause vasoconstriction with minimal effects on heart rate or contractility. They have no role in the treatment of hyperkalemia.\n(Choice B) Beta-1 agonists have chronotropic and inotropic effects, and are not used in treating hyperkalemia.\n(Choice D) Alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists cause peripheral vasodilation, and are used in the treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, not hyperkalemia.\n(Choice E) Beta-1 blockers are commonly used in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. They are not indicated in the treatment of hyperkalemia.\nEducational objective:\nAgents used to shift potassium intracellularly include insulin and glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and beta-2 agonists."

      " D. Glipizide",
      " E. Nifedipine"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient described has diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His lab values indicate hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis given his primary decrease in bicarbonate and his anion gap of 8 (NL = 6 – 12). Renal insufficiency accompanied by hyperkalemia and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is consistent with type 4 renal tubular acidosis. Type 4 RTA is caused by aldosterone deficiency or renal tubular insensitivity to aldosterone. The lack of aldosterone effect in these patients leads to a failure to secrete acid as NH4+ and retention of potassium. Type 4 RTA may occur in the setting of diabetic nephropathy due to type I or II DM, and the condition can be worsened by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as ACE-Is and ARBs.\n(Choice A) Chronic renal failure is a common cause of hypochloremic (anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to failure to excrete acid as NH4+ and accumulation of organic anions.\n(Choice C) Furosemide is a loop diuretic that may cause hypovolemia leading to contraction alkalosis. Contraction alkalosis is a metabolic alkalosis; laboratory tests would show a primary increase in bicarbonate.\n(Choice D) Glipizide is a sulfonylurea-class oral hypoglycemic. The most common adverse effect associated with these agents is hypoglycemia. They may rarely cause hyponatremia, but are not associated with acid-base disturbances.\n(Choice E) Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. It most commonly causes gastroesophageal reflux, headache and peripheral edema. The CCBs are not associated with acid-base disturbances.\nEducational objective:\nType 4 renal tubular acidosis should be suspected in a diabetic patient with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, persistent hyperkalemia, and renal insufficiency."

High PaCO2 and low PaO2 levels are suggestive of alveolar hypoventilation, though an elevated PaCO2 alone, in the range of 50 to 80 mmHg, is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Causes of alveolar hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis include the following:\nPulmonary / thoracic diseases: COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, cystic fibrosis, obesity (Pickwickian), scoliosis, ankylosis\nNeuromuscular diseases: myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton, poliomyelitis, muscular dystrophies, Guillain-Barre, ALS\nDrug-induced hypoventilation: anesthetics, narcotics, sedatives\nPrimary CNS dysfunction: brainstem lesion, infection, stroke\n(Choices B, C, D and E) Acute pulmonary embolism, atelectasis, pulmonary edema and pleural effusion can cause a decrease in PaO2 (hypoxemia), but these conditions typically also cause a decrease in PaCO2 (respiratory alkalosis) due to concomitant tachypnea.\nEducational Objective:\nRespiratory acidosis is characterized by a decreased pH and a primary increase in the PaCO2. Alveolar hypoventilation is an important cause of respiratory acidosis."

      " A. Primary polydipsia",
      " B. Drug-induced ADH resistance",
      " C. Increased ADH production",
      " D. Drug-induced water retention",
      " E. Deficient ADH secretion"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This woman's altered mental status and seizures are most likely the result of hyponatremia secondary to primary polydipsia. Primary polydipsia is relatively common among patients with schizophrenia. Because patients with primary polydipsia have normally functioning kidneys, they excrete dilute urine (low specific gravity, <=1.003) as their bodies attempt to regain osmotic balance. Primary polydipsia is the only answer choice above that would cause both hyponatremia and maximally dilute urine. Simultaneous administration of phenothiazines to schizophrenic patients with primary polydipsia can worsen the hyponatremia because dry mouth is a side effect that further stimulates thirst.\n(Choice B) Lithium-induced ADH resistance causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients cannot retain water appropriately, and thus develop hypernatremia in the setting of maximally dilute urine.\n(Choice C) SIADH causes inappropriate retention of free water, leading to hyponatremia in the setting of inappropriately concentrated urine.\n(Choice D) Carbamazepine intensifies the kidneys’ response to ADH, causing water retention, hyponatremia, and inappropriately concentrated urine, as in SIADH.\n(Choice E) In central diabetes insipidus (DI), insufficient hypothalamic ADH release causes excessive renal water excretion, hypernatremia, and dilute urine. Exogenous ADH administration can distinguish central from nephrogenic DI. Central DI corrects with exogenously administered ADH, nephrogenic DI does not.\nEducational objective:\nPrimary polydipsia is a problem of excessive water ingestion. The kidneys continue to work appropriately, excreting dilute urine. The diagnosis of primary polydipsia is confirmed by withholding water from the patient, and monitoring the urine. Increases in urine osmolality and specific gravity confirm the diagnosis."

      " DO. Mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis",
      " E. NMarmal acid-base balance"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient described has a mixed acid-base disorder resulting from a combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis. The low pH (7.23 < 7.35) indicates acidosis, the decreased HCO3- (16 mEq/L < 24 mEq/L) indicated a primary metabolic acidosis and the inappropriately normal PaCO2 (40 mmHg) indicates a primary respiratory acidosis. To prove that the PaCO2 is inappropriately normal, Winter's formula can be used to calculate what the PaCO2 ought to be in order to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. Winter's formula is as follows:\nPaCO2 = 1.5(HCO3-) + 8\nIn this patient, appropriate respiratory compensation would result in a PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, which is lower than his actual PaCO2 of 40 mmHg. This indicates that the patient's PaCO2 is elevated relative to what it ought to be given the metabolic acidosis.\nEducational objective:\nMixed acid-base disorders may cause inappropriately normal laboratory values. Calculate the expected change in the PaCO2 or HCO3- and compare that to the patient's measured values to determine if a mixed disorder exists or if normal physiologic compensation has occurred."

      " E. Intravenous dopamine"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Based on the information provided, the patient described is suffering from a postoperative pneumonia that is developing into septic shock (acidosis, low urine output, hypotension, tachypnea, fever). His ABG is suggestive of metabolic acidosis (decreased pH, primary decrease in bicarbonate level), which has likely resulted from the accumulation of lactate in the blood secondary to tissue hypoxia and anaerobic respiration resulting from hypotension related to septic shock. The treatment of septic shock is correction of the underlying cause and restoration of tissue perfusion. IV normal saline is the first-line treatment for maintenance of intravascular pressure while antibiotics are given to correct the underlying infection.\n(Choice A) The use of bicarbonate in the treatment of lactic acidosis is controversial and is recommended only in severe acute acidosis (pH <= 7.2).\n(Choice B) Dextrose solutions are not as widely accepted as normal saline for the maintenance of blood pressure.\n(Choice C) Hypertonic saline is used occasionally to rapidly expand the intravascular volume by drawing fluid out of the extravascular compartment.\n(Choice E) Vasopressors are indicated for the treatment of hypotension in states of shock only after intravenous fluids have failed to restore normotension.\nEducational Objective:\nThe most important steps in the management of lactic acidosis from septic shock are IV normal saline with or without vasopressor therapy to maintain the intravascular pressure and antibiotics to correct the underlying infection."

      " D. Primary metabolic alkalosis with renal compensation",
      " E. Normal acid base status"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This vignette describes the classic presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which usually occurs in type 1 diabetics. He probably has not been taking his insulin due to severe depression. Typical symptoms of DKA include polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain that may mimic a surgical abdomen. The patient's ABG indicates that a metabolic acidosis (pH below 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-, compensatory decrease in PCO2) with an increased anion gap [AG = 132-(85+14) = 33]. Due to the accumulation of ketoacids in the blood, DKA is by definition an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Winter's formula can be used to calculate the expected PCO2 during respiratory compensation for a primary metabolic acidosis. Winter's formula is as follows:\nPaCO2 = 1.5(HCO3-) + 8\nUsing the patient's values, the expected PaCO2 is 29. In this patient, the measured PCO2 is within the range of the expected PCO2 in his ABG. This indicates complete respiratory compensation of his metabolic acidosis. Clinically, respiratory compensation of DKA occurs via deep and rapid breathing (Kussmaul breathing).\n(Choice B) Primary metabolic acidosis without compensation would cause a decreased pH, a primarily decreased HCO3-, and no change in the PCO2.\n(Choice C) Respiratory acidosis with compensation would cause a decreased pH, a primarily increased PCO2, and a secondarily increased HCO3-.\n(Choice D) Primary metabolic alkalosis with renal compensation occurs physiologically as follows. The primary metabolic alkalosis causes an abnormal accumulation of HCO3-. As a result, the filtered load of HCO3- into the renal tubules is increased beyond the capability of the kidneys to reabsorb it. Thus, in metabolic alkalosis, renal HCO3- losses automatically increase. The patient's ABG indicates a metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis.\n(Choice E) Normal acid base status is pH 7.35 to 7.45, HCO3- of 22 – 26 mEq/L, and PCO2 of 35 – 45 mm Hg.\nEducational Objective:\nDiabetic ketoacidosis causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Typical symptoms of DKA include polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain that may mimic a surgical abdomen."

      " D. Aspiration pneumanitis",
      " E. Hyperemesis gravidarum"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient has metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. This can be determined by her ABG results showing a pH greater than 7.45, a primary increase in HCO3- level and a compensatory increase in PaCO2. The increase in PaCO2 does not indicate a mixed primary acid-base disturbance because the compensatory increase in PaCO2 expected given the metabolic acidosis is approximately 52 – 53 mm Hg. Vomiting, such as in hyperemesis gravidarum, leads to loss of gastric HCl and metabolic alkalosis. This is known as the generation stage of metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting. The volume loss that results from repeated vomiting also causes a contraction metabolic alkalosis due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This is known as the maintenance phase.\n(Choice A) Hypocapnia is a normal phenomenon of late pregnancy and would cause a respiratory alkalosis. It is caused by a direct stimulatory effect of progesterone on the central respiratory center.\n(Choice B) This patient may have a deep vein thrombosis (swollen leg), but a pulmonary embolus (PE) is unlikely. PE causes a primary respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation.\n(Choice C) Obesity can cause hypoventilation (Pickwickian syndrome) leading to chronic respiratory acidosis. While the patient's BMI is at the lower limit of obesity, she is also pregnant. Additionally, she is not experiencing a primary respiratory acidosis.\n(Choice D) Aspiration pneumonia leads to hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis secondary to tachypnea.\nEducational Objective:\nHyperemesis gravidarum typically causes metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation via hypercapnia."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Major causes of altered mental status in elderly patients include electrolyte disturbances, stroke, cardiac events and infection. The elderly are at an increased risk of dehydration due to decreased ability to access free water and impaired thirst. The patient described in the question exhibits signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and a soft blood pressure with a somewhat rapid pulse. Hypernatremia may result from loss of free water or excessive sodium intake. Decreased access to free water causes hypernatremia due to obligate urinary water losses in the face of maximal renal sodium reabsorption in an effort to correct volume contraction.\n(Choice A) Hyponatremia can result from multiple etiologies causing free water excess or sodium wasting. SIADH may cause hyponatremia in patients following stroke, but such patients are usually euvolemic. Diuretics may also cause hyponatremia in elderly patients.\n(Choice B) Hypokalemia causes muscle weakness and abdominal complaints; it does not typically cause mental status changes.\n(Choice D) Hyperkalemia does not cause mental status changes; it is associated with muscle weakness and EKG changes (cardiac arrhythmias).\n(Choice E) Hypocalcemia can cause mental status changes, but in most cases of dehydration the calcium level is elevated due to hemoconcentration.\nEducational objective:\nDecreased free water intake will cause hypernatremia due to obligate renal free water losses and sodium reabsorption by the kidney.

    "explanation": "The patient has a metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-) with an increased anion gap (Normal = 6 – 12, Patient's AG = 28). All of the given choices can cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis. When the anion gap is markedly elevated and frank uremia is not present, the osmolar gap should be calculated to assess for ethanol, methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication.\nFirst, the serum osmolality is calculated using the following formula:\nSerum osmolality = [2Na + Glu/18 + BUN/2.8]\nIn this patient, the calculated osmolality is 297. The osmolar gap is then calculated using the formula:\nOsmolar gap = observed osmolarity - calculated osmolarity\nIn this patient, the osmolar gap is 53 (normal < 10). The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap and a high osmolar gap. Osmolar gap metabolic acidosis is seen with acute methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. The patient's urine shows rectangular, envelope-shaped crystals consistent with calcium oxalate crystals, which are classically observed in patients with ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol poisoning most commonly follows antifreeze ingestion. Serious sequelae following ethylene glycol ingestion include acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure and renal failure.\n(Choice A) Aspirin (salicylate) toxicity causes a mixed anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis with no osmolar gap.\n(Choice C) Methyl alcohol poisoning can cause visual changes (\"snowfield vision\") and acute pancreatitis, but will not cause urine crystals and renal failure.\n(Choice D) Uremia (renal failure) causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to failure to excrete acids as NH4+.\n(Choice E) Lactic acidosis can result from numerous causes including poor delivery of oxygen to the tissues and poor oxygen utilization by the tissues. The result is an anion gap metabolic acidosis.\nEducational objective:\nCalcium oxalate crystals (rectangular, envelope-shaped crystals) are seen in patients with ethylene glycol (anti-freeze) poisoning. Ethylene glycol, methanol and ethanol intoxication cause metabolic acidosis with both an anion gap and an osmolar gap."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The major extracellular buffer in human blood is the carbon dioxide – bicarbonate buffer pair, which has a pk of 6.1. Acid-base disturbances in patients can be diagnosed by assessing the pH and the changes in either the serum bicarbonate concentration or the serum partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Classically, the acid-base status of a buffer can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with its three variables, pH, [acid] and [conjugate base], as follows:\npH = pK + log ([conjugate base] / [acid])\nIn the case of the carbon dioxide – bicarbonate buffer pair, where CO2 is the acid and HCO3- is the conjugate base, the equation is as follows:\npH = 6.1 + log ([HCO3-] / (0.03 x PaCO2))\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, any of the three variables can be calculated if the other two are given. Thus, with respect to the above question, if the pH and PaCO2 are given (Choice A), the HCO3- can be calculated, and with these three data points the acid-base status of the patient can be determined.\n(Choices B, C, D and E) The PO2 gives information about a patient's oxygenation status. The urinary pH, which can vary widely between 4.5 and 8, can give information about renal handling of acids and bases, but it cannot be used to determine a patient's serum acid-base status with the same clarity that pH, HCO3- and PaCO2 can.\nEducational objective:\nIn any patient, the pH and PaCO2 are the two lab values that provide the best picture of acid-base status; the HCO3- can be calculated from these values using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation."

This clinical scenario is highly suggestive of aspirin (salicylate) intoxication. Acute aspirin toxicity stimulates the central respiratory center and leads to respiratory alkalosis by causing tachypnea.

First, salicylate toxicity causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation thereby increasing the rate of oxygen consumption in the peripheral tissues. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is also the cause of the hyperpyrexia seen in aspirin toxicity. Next, salicylate toxicity inhibits enzymes involved with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism leading to accumulation of organic acids such as pyruvate, lactic, and acetoacetic acid. Finally, salicylates impair renal function causing accumulation of inorganic acids such as sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Salicylate toxicity may thus present with a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a near-normal pH, a primary decrease in PaCO2, and a concurrent primary decrease in HCO3-.\nIt is important to stress that the abovementioned case is not a primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation (pH less than 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-, compensatory decrease in PaCO2). Winter's formula can be used to calculate the expected compensatory PaCO2 value in primary metabolic acidoses. Using this formula, the expected PaCO2 value is 26 (PaCO2 = 1.5[HCO3-] + 8). The observed PaCO2 is less than the expected value, thus indicating a coexisting primary respiratory alkalosis.\n(Choice B) Acute respiratory acidosis without compensation is characterized by a pH less than 7.35, primary increase in PaCO2, and normal HCO3-.\n(Choice C) Primary metabolic acidosis without compensation is characterized by a pH less than 7.35, primary decrease in HCO3-, and a near normal PaCO2.\n(Choice D) Normal acid-base status is characterized by a pH ranging from 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 ranging from 35-45, and HCO3- of 24.\n(Choice E) Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation is characterized by a pH greater than 7.45, primary decrease in PaCO2, and compensatory decrease in HCO3-.\nEducational objective:\nSuspect aspirin intoxication in a patient with the triad of fever, tinnitus and tachypnea. Adults with aspirin toxicity develop a mixed respiratory alkalosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis."
