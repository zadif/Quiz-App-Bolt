      "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of swelling in his groin that he first noticed 2 weeks ago. Physical examination shows a bulge above the inguinal ligament that increases in size when the patient is asked to cough. He is referred to a surgeon and scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic hernia repair. Which of the following landmarks will best aid the surgeon in distinguishing an indirect from a direct inguinal hernia?",
      "options": [
        "A. Inferior epigastric vessels",
        "B. Cooper's ligament",
        "C. Femoral vein",
        "D. Transversalis fascia",
        "E. Rectus muscle sheath",
        "F. Spermatic cord"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Inguinal hernias are common in men, and 25% will be found to have an inguinal hernia during their lifetime (versus 2% of women). In contrast to femoral hernias, inguinal hernias are located above the inguinal ligament. The inferior epigastric vessels serve as an anatomic landmark that can be used to distinguish between direct and indirect inguinal hernias. These vessels are clearly visible on the anterior abdominal wall during laparoscopic hernia repair.\n\nIndirect inguinal hernias are more common than direct and tend to appear on the right side. They occur due to failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate, allowing abdominal contents to protrude through the deep inguinal ring. Abdominal contents follow the path of the inguinal canal and may exit through the external inguinal ring into the Scrotum. On examination, these hernias can be detected by deep palpation of the external ring with the tip of the finger.\n\nDirect inguinal hernias protrude through Hesselbach's triangle, a weak spot of the anterior abdominal wall. Hesselbach's triangle is bounded by the rectus abdominis muscle medially, inferior epigastric vessels laterally, and inguinal ligament inferiorly. Compared to indirect inguinal hernias, direct hernias are less prone to incarceration due to their wide neck. It is also uncommon for them to descend into the scrotum as there is no direct path. Direct inguinal hernias are best felt with the pulp of the examiner's finger on deep palpation.\n(Choice B) Cooper's (pectineal) ligament will be posterior to a femoral hernia.\n(Choice C) The femoral vein will be lateral to a femoral hernia.\n(Choice D) The transversalis fascia lies posteriorly to indirect inguinal hernias.\n(Choice E) The rectus abdominis muscle sheath is medial to direct inguinal hernias.\n(Choice F) Indirect inguinal hernial sacs are located along the anteromedial aspect of the spermatic cord.\nEducational objective:\nIndirect inguinal hernias are located lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. They can continue into the scrotum and are felt by deep palpation of the external inguinal ring with the tip of the finger. In contrast, direct inguinal hernias are located medially to the inferior epigastric vessels. They do not protrude into the scrotum and are best felt with the pulp of the finger."

      "question": "A patient is being evaluated for recurrent urinary tract infections. Her abdominal CT scan is shown below. Which of the following most likely prevented the proper ascent of the anomalous organ seen on the CT scan?",
      "options": [
        "A. Superior mesenteric artery",
        "B. Vitellointestinal duct",
        "C. Persistent urachus",
        "D. Inferior vena cava",
        "E. Inferior mesenteric artery"
      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "The abdominal CT scan shows the kidneys joined at their lower poles. This is the most common variant of horseshoe kidney, occurring in 90% of cases. In the other 10%, fusion occurs at the upper poles. Horseshoe kidney is found in approximately 1 out of every 500 autopsies and may lead to urinary tract obstruction and the development of hydronephrosis.\n\nDuring embryogenesis, kidney development proceeds through the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros stages. The fetal metanephros is initially located in the sacral region. In adults the mature kidneys are located at vertebral levels T12-L3 (the kidney is slightly lower on the right compared to the left side). The relative ascent of the kidneys from the sacral region to their normal anatomic position results from the disproportionately rapid growth of the caudal part of the embryo.\n\nWhen fusion of the lower or upper poles of the kidney occurs, the central part of the newly formed horseshoe kidney lies across the midline anterior to the great vessels. This centrally located isthmus is trapped by the inferior mesenteric artery during the ascent of the kidney.\n(Choice A) The superior mesenteric artery is located above the inferior mesenteric artery. It leaves the aorta at the level of L1 and does not serve as an obstacle for the ascent of a horseshoe kidney.\n(Choice B) When the vitelline duct persists, a connection is formed between the intestinal lumen and the outside of the body at the umbilicus. Discharge of meconium from the umbilicus will be seen in this condition.\n(Choice C) A direct connection between the bladder lumen and the outside of the body at the umbilicus is called a persistent urachus or urachal fistula. This condition would likely have been identified earlier in the patient's life.\n(Choice D) The inferior vena cava lies posterior to the isthmus of a horseshoe kidney and would not obstruct its ascent.\nEducational objective:\nIn horseshoe kidney, both kidneys are fused together at the poles in early embryonic life. The isthmus of horseshoe kidney usually lies anterior to the aorta and inferior vena cava and posterior to the inferior mesenteric artery. This centrally located isthmus becomes trapped behind the inferior mesenteric artery during the relative ascent of the kidney."

      "explanation": "This patient has palpable firm superficial inguinal lymph nodes. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes drain all cutaneous lymph from the umbilicus to the feet, including the external genitalia and anus (up to the beginning of the rectum, the dentate line), but excluding the posterior calf, which drains to the popliteal lymph nodes. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes lie in a region bounded by the inguinal ligament, sartorius muscle, and adductor longus muscle, and overlie the femoral nerve, artery and vein.\n(Choice A) In general, lymph vessels follow the paths of the arteries and veins supplying a particular structure. The testes receive their blood supply from the testicular arteries, which arise directly from the abdominal aorta just inferior to the renal arteries. The lymph vessels that drain the testes follow a path from the testes to the abdominal aortic lymph nodes.\n(Choice B) Lymph from the prostate drains primarily to the internal iliac nodes, but also to the external iliac nodes and sacral nodes (minor pathways).\n(Choice C) Lymph from the superior portion of the bladder drains to the external iliac nodes while lymph from the inferior portion of the bladder drains to the internal iliac nodes.\n(Choice E) Lymph from the sigmoid colon drains to the inferior mesenteric lymph nodes.\nEducational Objective:\nAll skin from the umbilicus down, including the anus (up to the dentate/pectinate line) but excluding the posterior calf, drains to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes."

      "question": "A 54-year-old female with chronic pelvic pain is found to have a right-sided ovarian mass. After the initial evaluation, surgery is planned to remove the mass. To avoid excessive bleeding during the surgery the surgeon should ligate which of the following structures?",
      "options": [
        "A. Round ligament",
        "B. Suspensory ligament",
        "C. Ovarian ligament",
        "D. Transverse cervical ligament",
        "E. Mesosalpinx"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The ovaries are the female gonadal organs, located in the pelvis. The ovaries are covered by the mesovarium, which extends to form the broad ligament of the uterus. The uterine tube, ovarian ligament, round ligament of the uterus, and a portion of the Suspensory ligament of the ovary are also surrounded by the broad ligament. The nerves, arteries, veins, and lymphatics supplying the ovary are all delivered by the suspensory ligament of the ovary.\nThe ovarian blood supply is provided by the ovarian arteries, which arise from the abdominal aorta bilaterally. The right ovarian vein drains into the inferior vena cava and the left ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein. The parasympathetic innervation of the ovary is derived from the vagus nerve. The ureters course retroperitoneally in close association with the gonadal vessels. A common complication in surgeries ligating the ovarian vasculature in the Suspensory ligament is accidental ligation of the ureter.\n(Choice A) There are two major ‘round ligaments in the body: the round ligament of the uterus and the round ligament of the liver. The round ligament of the uterus courses through the inguinal canal and links the horn of the uterus to the external genitalia. It contains the artery of Sampson which rarely is a source of a major bleeding.\n(Choice C) The ovarian ligament carries no named blood vessels. It courses from the uterine pole of the ovary to the body of the uterus just below the uterine tubes.\n(Choice D) The transverse cervical ligament, also known as the cardinal ligament, extends from the cervix and lateral fornix of the vagina to the lateral pelvic walls. The uterine artery courses in this tissue and requires ligation during radical hysterectomy.\n(Choice E) The mesosalpinx is the region of the broad ligament of the uterus that lies between the uterine tube and the ovary.\nEducational Objective:\nThe nerves and vessels supplying the ovary are delivered through the Suspensory ligament of the ovary."

      "question": "A 40-year-old nuligravida woman comes to the physician due to worsening left pelvic pain over the last 2 months. She experiences the pain daily, and its intensity does not vary during her menstrual cycle. The patient's waist size has increased despite a decreased appetite. Pelvic examination shows an irregularly shaped, fixed adnexal mass. One week later, the patient undergoes surgery for removal of a large ovarian neoplasm. Within the true pelvis, the surgeon can most likely palpate the left ureter immediately anterolateral to which of the following structures?",
      "options": [
        "A. External iliac artery",
        "B. Gonadal vein",
        "C. Inferior vena cava",
        "D. Internal iliac artery",
        "E. Uterine artery"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The ureters originate bilaterally at the renal pelvis and course inferiorly toward the bladder within the retroperitoneum just anterior to the psoas muscles. Midway from the kidney to the pelvic inlet, the gonadal artery and vein cross over the anterior surface of the ureter. The ureters then gain access to the pelvis by crossing over the anterior surface of the common iliac artery near its bifurcation into the internal and external iliac arteries. At this point, the ureter lies medial to the gonadal vessels and anterolateral to the internal iliac artery. In females, the ureter then courses along the uterosacral ligament just deep to the uterine vessels (‘water under the bridge\") before entering the bladder. Due to their course and close proximity to other structures, the ureters are at particular risk for injury during surgery in the pelvis.\n(Choice A) The ureters course over the anterior surface of the external iliac artery at, or just after, the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. After coursing over the common/external iliac artery, the ureter is considered to be in the pelvis. However, the external iliac artery continues along the pelvic brim and passes under the inguinal ligament to become the femoral artery; it does not enter the true pelvis.\n(Choice B) The gonadal vessels cross anteriorly over the ureters bilaterally within the retroperitoneum before the ureters enter the pelvis. In males, the gonadal vessels never enter the true pelvis; they course around the pelvic brim before entering the deep ring of the inguinal canal. In females, the ureters course within the true pelvis medial to the ovarian vessels.\n(Choice C) The inferior vena cava rests on the right side of the vertebral bodies and splits into the common iliac veins at the L4 level. The common iliac veins bifurcate into the internal and external iliac veins at the pelvic inlet.\n(Choice E) In females, the ureters course along the uterosacral ligament together with the vaginal artery before entering the bladder. The uterine artery courses within the cardinal ligament and crosses over the anterior surface of the ureter (\"water under the bridge\") before reaching the uterus.\nEducational objective:\nThe ureters cross over the common/external iliac vessels and under the gonadal vessels (and uterine vessels in females). They lie anterolateral to the internal iliac vessels and medial to the ovarian vessels within the true pelvis."

Urinary complaints are the primary symptoms in BPH, including urinary hesitancy, urgency, frequency, incomplete voiding, post-void leakage of urine, and nocturia. Diagnosis is made from the history and physical, including the digital rectal exam.\nMedical treatment of BPH is with a-adrenergic blockers, which relax the smooth muscle in the bladder neck, or with 5-a reductase inhibitors, which reduce hormonal influence on the prostate by preventing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. In the pelvic CT \"slice\" given in the question stem, the prostate is labeled (A).\" At this level of sectioning, the prostate is located posterior to the pubic symphysis and anterior to the anal canal /(B).\"\n(Choice C) C is the distal end of bladder.\n(Choice D) D labels the ischioanal fossa.\n(Choice E) E is the rectus abdominus muscle.\n(Choice F) F is the gluteus maximus muscle.\nEducational Objective:\nBPH is a common, age-related condition that causes urinary symptoms and can be medically treated with a-adrenergic blockers or 5-a reductase inhibitors.

      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The 12th rib overlies the parietal pleura medially and the kidney laterally. Recall that the 11th and 12th ribs are “floating ribs, meaning that they are not bound to the anterior rib cage by cartilage as are the more superior “false ribs. For this reason, the distal tip of the left 12th rib can be displaced into the retroperitoneum when fractured, lacerating the left kidney.\n(Choice B) The spleen lies in the posterior superior portion of the left abdominal cavity. The left 9th, 10th and 11th ribs overlie the spleen.\n(Choice C) The liver occupies much of the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity. The 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th ribs overlie the liver's posterior surface on the right. The positions of both the liver and spleen shift slightly with diaphragmatic movement during inhalation and exhalation.\n(Choice D) The visceral pleura envelop the lungs. At rest, the inferior margin of the left lung lies at the level of the 10th rib in the midscapular line. During maximal inhalation, the lung may descend to the level of the most medial portion of the 12th rib, but fractures of the 1st through 6th ribs have the greatest chance of damaging the visceral pleura.\n(Choice E) The pancreas is a partially retroperitoneal organ that overlies the body of the second lumbar vertebra. Classically, crushing abdominal trauma is the injury that causes pancreatic damage.\nEducational Objective:\nThe left kidney lies immediately deep to the tip of the 12th rib on the left."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Anatomy\nIndirect inguinal: Enters internal inguinal ring lateral to inferior epigastric vessels. Caused by persistent processus vaginalis & failure of internal inguinal ring to close.\nDirect inguinal: Bulges through Hesselbach's triangle, medial to inferior epigastric vessels, to reach external inguinal ring. Caused by weakness of the transversalis fascia.\nFemoral: Protrudes through the femoral ring, medial to the femoral vessels & inferior to the inguinal ligament.\n\nDirect and indirect inguinal hernias are both located above the inguinal ligament. Direct inguinal hernias protrude through Hesselbach's triangle, which is formed by the inguinal ligament inferiorly, the inferior epigastric vessels laterally, and the rectus abdominus muscle medially. The transversalis fascia forms the floor of the triangle, and defects or weakness involving the transversalis fascia can lead to protrusion of abdominal contents through Hesselbach's triangle into the inguinal canal. Failure of this fascial layer is most often due to acquired connective tissue abnormalities or chronic abdominal wall injury. Thus, direct inguinal hernias are more common in the elderly.\n\nDirect inguinal hernias do not pass through the deep inguinal ring but pass only through the superficial inguinal ring. As a result they are covered only by the external spermatic fascia, in contrast to indirect inguinal hernias, which are covered by all 3 spermatic fascial layers.\n(Choices B and C) Indirect inguinal hernias are the most common type of groin hernia in both sexes. They frequently occur in infants, children, and young adults due to failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate and the internal inguinal ring to close. Indirect inguinal hernias protrude through the internal inguinal ring, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels.\n(Choice D) The rectus abdominis muscle forms the medial border of Hesselbach's triangle. Direct inguinal hernias are located lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle.\n(Choice E) Femoral hernias occur below the inguinal ligament and protrude through the femoral ring, which is medial to the femoral sheath and lateral to the lacunar ligament. The femoral sheath contains the femoral artery and femoral vein.\nEducational objective:\nDirect hernias occur most commonly in older men and are caused by weakness of the transversalis fascia in Hesselbach's triangle. They are medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, protrude only through the external inguinal ring, and are covered by the external spermatic fascia."

      "explanation": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with hydrocele. Hydrocele occurs when serous fluid collects within the tunica vaginalis.\nDuring embryogenesis, the testis descends through the inguinal canal, drawing a diverticulum of peritoneum into the scrotum as it descends. This peritoneal tissue is known as the processus vaginalis. Normally, the communication between the processus vaginalis and the peritoneum is obliterated, and the tunica vaginalis is the tissue that remains overlying the testis and epididymis. Congenital hydrocele, as described in the question stem, results when the processus vaginalis remains patent, allowing fluid from the peritoneum to accumulate in the scrotum.\n(Choice A) The external spermatic fascia is derived from the aponeurosis of the external oblique abdominal muscle. This is the outermost layer of the spermatic cord and lies deep to the dartos muscle and scrotal fascia.\n(Choice B) The cremasteric fascia arises from the internal oblique abdominal muscle and aponeurosis.\n(Choice C) The internal spermatic fascia is derived from the transversalis fascia. This layer immediately overlies the spermatic cord and tunica vaginalis.\n(Choice D) The tunica albuginea is the fibrous tissue that overlies the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa of the penis.\nEducational Objective:\nTesticular hydrocele results when serous fluid accumulates within the tunica vaginalis.

        "E. Lumbar arteries",
        "F. Superior vesical artery"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In a kidney transplant operation, the native kidneys are typically left in place, and the donor kidney is placed retroperitoneally in the right iliac fossa. Blood supply to the donor organ is typically established by anastomosing the donor renal artery with the recipient's external iliac artery. Similarly, the donor renal vein is connected to the recipient's external iliac vein. The proximal 1/3 of the donor ureter is preserved and used to establish continuity from the collecting system of the kidney to the recipient's bladder. This portion of the ureter receives its blood supply from branches of the renal artery. (More distally, the ureters are supplied by branches from the aorta and iliac, gonadal and vesical arteries.) Ureteric ischemia occurs in approximately 29% of renal transplant patients.\n(Choice A) Small branches from the common iliac artery may supply the ureter's midportion.\n(Choice B) The inferior phrenic arteries are branches of the aorta that supply the diaphragm and provide branches to the suprarenal glands. These arteries do not supply the ureters.\n(Choice C) An alternate method of providing blood supply to a transplanted kidney is end-to-end anastomosis with the internal iliac artery. The internal iliac artery does not directly contribute to the blood supply of the ureter.\n(Choice E) The lumbar arteries, like the intercostal arteries, arise directly from the aorta to supply the lumbar vertebrae and surrounding structures. They do not supply the ureters.\n(Choice F) The superior vesical artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies blood to the superior portion of the urinary bladder. It also provides branches to the distal ureter.\nEducational Objective:\nThe proximal 1/3 of the ureter receives its blood supply from branches of the renal artery. For this reason, this portion of the donor ureter is typically viable after renal transplantation."

      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Lymphatic drainage of the scrotum occurs via the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. These lymph nodes drain nearly all cutaneous lymph from the umbilicus to the feet, including the external genitalia and anus (up to the dentate line). The exceptions are the testis, glans penis, and the cutaneous portion of the posterior calf. Lymph from the testes drains directly into the para-aortic (retroperitoneal) lymph nodes (Choice D). Lymph from the glans penis and the cutaneous portion of the posterior calf drains into the deep inguinal lymph nodes. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes also drain into the deep inguinal lymph nodes.\n(Choice A) The common iliac nodes are located alongside the common iliac artery and drain the internal and external iliac nodes. The external iliac nodes receive lymph from the deep inguinal lymph nodes.\n(Choice B) The inferior mesenteric nodes drain the structures supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (eg, the left colic, sigmoid, and superior rectal arteries). Thus, these nodes drain the descending and sigmoid colon as well as the upper part of the rectum, and their efferents drain into the pre-aortic nodes.\n(Choice C) Infraclavicular lymph nodes are found beside the cephalic vein between the pectoralis major and deltoid, immediately below the clavicle. They drain lymph from portions of the upper limb and breast.\nEducational objective:\nDue to its intra-abdominal origin, lymphatic drainage of the testis is to the para-aortic lymph nodes.

      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Male urogenital anatomy\nThe presence of a pelvic fracture and inability to void despite the sensation of a full bladder is suggestive of urethral injury. Additional signs of urethral injury include the presence of blood at the urethral meatus and a high-riding, boggy prostate (caused by hematoma formation below the gland). If urethral injury is suspected, placement of a Foley catheter is contraindicated and should not be attempted as it can worsen the injury; a retrograde urethrogram should be performed first to assess urethral integrity.\nUrethral injuries most commonly occur in men because of their longer urethral length and are divided into anterior and posterior urethral injuries. The posterior urethra is located above the bulb of the penis, and the anterior urethra lies within the bulb and the remainder of the corpus spongiosum. The posterior urethra is further divided into the prostatic and membranous segments; the anterior urethra is divided into bulbous and penile segments. In contrast to the prostatic and bulbous segments, the membranous segment is relatively unsupported by the adjacent tissues and is the weakest point of the posterior urethra. Trauma to the pelvis severe enough to cause fracture often results in disruption of the posterior urethra at the bulbomembranous junction.\n(Choice A) Injury of the anterior bladder wall is common with pelvic fractures and is usually associated with extraperitoneal leakage of urine. Superior bladder wall ruptures often occur with abdominal trauma when the bladder is full and result in leakage of urine into the intraperitoneal cavity. This patient's full bladder sensation and inability to pass a Foley catheter makes a urethral injury more likely.\n(Choice B) The prostatic urethral segment is strengthened by the surrounding prostate tissue and thus is less likely to be damaged from a pelvic fracture.\n(Choice D) Although the bulbous urethral segment is reinforced by the surrounding corpus spongiosum, it is susceptible to crushing injuries when the perineum is struck forcefully (ie, straddle injury). Common mechanisms include falling on the crossbar of a bicycle or the top of a fence.\n(Choice E) The penile urethral segment is most commonly injured due to penetrating trauma or instrumentation.\nEducational objective:\nInjury to the posterior urethra is associated with pelvic fractures, and the anterior urethra is most commonly damaged in straddle injuries. Inability to void with a full bladder sensation, a high-riding boggy prostate, and blood at the urethral meatus are suggestive of urethral injury, particularly in the presence of a pelvic fracture. If urethral injury is suspected, placement of a Foley catheter is contraindicated.\nReferences:\n1. Diagnosis and classification of urethral injuries.\n2.

In contrast to the right renal vein, the left renal vein drains the left suprarenal gland and the left gonad in addition to the kidney. The renal veins do not participate in portal circulation. The patient described in the case above is a male, so venous hypertension due to obstruction of the left renal vein would eventually cause incompetence of the valves of the testicular veins and engorgement of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis, leading to a left-sided varicocele. Varicocele is most common on the left side due to this anatomy. Varicocele arising from idiopathic failure of the valves of the testicular vein is generally left untreated unless it becomes symptomatic or is felt to be causing problems with fertility.\n(Choices A, B and E) Esophageal varices, rectal varices, and periumbilical venous distension are all signs of portal venous hypertension. The renal veins are not a part of the portal system.\n(Choice D) Unilateral left-sided ankle swelling can result from many causes including obstruction of the left common iliac vein, left external iliac vein, left femoral vein, or any of the other major veins of the left leg.\nEducational Objective:\nThe left gonadal (testicular or ovarian) vein drains into the left renal vein, commonly leading to left-sided varicoceles in males with obstructions of the left renal vein. The right gonadal vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava."

      "question": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that began about 6 hours ago. She also complains of vague pelvic pain over the last few months, but says her pain has never been this severe. Her temperature is 38.4° C (101° F), blood pressure is 141/90 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows a moderately distended abdomen. There is a tender bulge below the inguinal ligament, just lateral to the pubic tubercle. The overlying skin is erythematous. Which of the following structures is most likely immediately lateral to the bulge?",
      "options": [
        "A. Inferior epigastric vessels",
        "B. Cooper's ligament",
        "C. Femoral vein",
        "D. Transversalis fascia",
        "E. Rectus muscle sheath",
        "F. Round ligament"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "There are 3 types of groin hernias: direct inguinal, indirect inguinal, and femoral. Direct and indirect inguinal hernias occur above the inguinal ligament; femoral hernias are located below it.\nFemoral hernias protrude through the femoral ring, which can widen and become lax with age. They are lateral to the pubic tubercle and lacunar ligament and medial to the femoral artery and vein. Femoral hernias are more common in women and tend to occur on the right side. Femoral hernias may present with upper thigh, groin, or pelvic discomfort.\nBecause the femoral canal is small, femoral hernias are prone to incarceration. Incarcerated hernias cannot be reduced; if a segment of bowel is present in the hernia sac, incarceration can cause bowel obstruction (nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain and distention). Impaired blood flow to contents trapped in the hernia sac occurs a few hours after incarceration, causing strangulation. Ischemia and necrosis of the contents of the hernia sac occur, which may lead to systemic symptoms such as fever.\n(Choice A) Direct inguinal hernias lie medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, and indirect inguinal hernias are lateral to the vessels.\n(Choice B) The pectineal (Cooper's) ligament is a thickened part of the pectineal fascia. It overlies the pectineal ridge of the pubic bone and is located posteriorly to the femoral canal.\n(Choice D) The transversalis fascia is found between the transversalis muscle and the extraperitoneal fat. It forms the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. The deep inguinal ring is an opening in the transversalis fascia and is the site of protrusion of indirect inguinal hernias.\n(Choice E) The rectus muscle sheath forms the medial border of Hesselbach's triangle. Direct inguinal hernias are located just lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle sheath.\n(Choice F) The round ligament in women is homologous to the spermatic cord in men. It leaves the pelvis through the deep inguinal ring and passes through the inguinal canal.\nEducational objective:\nFemoral hernias are inferior to the inguinal ligament, lateral to pubic tubercle, and medial to the femoral vein. They can present with groin discomfort or manifest with a bulge on the upper thigh. Incarceration and strangulation are common complications of femoral hernias."

      "question": "A 24-year-old male presents to your office complaining of lower abdominal discomfort. Physical examination reveals right-sided testicular enlargement that feels like a ‘bag of worms’ when the patient stands up. The venous blood from the affected testicle drains directly into the:",
      "options": [
        "A. Right internal iliac vein",
        "B. Inferior mesenteric vein",
        "C. Right renal vein",
        "D. Hemiazygous vein",
        "E. Inferior vena cava"
      ],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "This patient has a varicocele of the right testicle, as indicated by the ‘bag of worms’ texture of the scrotum on the affected side. This texture is produced by the reticular network of veins that drain the testicles, the pampiniform plexus. Failure of the venous valves leads to pooling of blood in the testicles due to their dependent location, causing varicoceles. Varicoceles can also result from upstream compression of the veins that drain the testes by abdominal or pelvic masses or other forces.\nRecall that the venous drainage of the testes is not bilaterally symmetric. The right testicular vein drains into the inferior vena cava (IVC) whereas the left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein which drains into the IVC. The left testicle is more commonly affected by varicocele, perhaps because the left renal vein passes between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and enlargement or hardening of the SMA may cause compression of the left renal vein and pooling of blood in the left testicle.\n(Choice A) The right internal iliac vein receives drainage from the pelvic viscera and genitalia (other than the gonads) and the gluteal region and regions served by the pudendal circulation.\n(Choice B) The inferior mesenteric vein drains the structures of the hindgut.\n(Choice C) The right renal vein drains only the right kidney. The right suprarenal gland drains directly into the IVC as opposed to the left suprarenal gland, which drains primarily into the left renal vein.\n(Choice D) The hemiazygous vein drains blood from the posterior walls of the thorax and abdomen. Together with the azygous vein and accessory hemiazygous vein, the hemiazygous vein provides an alternate pathway for blood to return to the heart bypassing the IVC.\nEducational Objective:\nThe right testicular vein drains directly into the IVC while the left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein."
